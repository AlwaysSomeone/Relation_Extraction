"00083312-7602-4959-8000-0535159d8f69","hi again everyone - welcome Dawnmik and KatiAK also - great to see you here. Dawn had to laugh at your comment 'Merry Christmas to me' - lol - isn't this just what we always wanted for Christmas!! Like you chemo sent me into menopause also - but doctors still tell me that my body could start up again - but I seriously doubt it. And yes tamoxifen is bringing on the hot flushes again which I thought had eased off a little. KatiAK - like you I had lumpectomy, chemo then rads. Also got back and neck pain badly last week of rads and only got better a couple weeks ago. I think we don't realise how much all that stuff affects our bodies. I felt like the radiation was definitely trying to clear from my body and looking for a way out! Have you started taking any iodine drops at all to try and help? Well over one week down now and yes hot flashes, aches, plus I do think I'm more irritable (grumpy/snappy) - anyone else feel like this? Plus I am eating too much - and like you KatiAK I want to concentrate on better diet and exercise. I seem to have weeks when I'm good and then weeks when I'm not so good. I just need to get my full motivation back. I'm not one to wallow in self pity - but I look in the mirror and I just want to look nice again - like I did this time last year - I don't have the hair or body I once had and how do I get this sluggish body back into shape!!

"0009599a-acee-4a20-95c4-3f0c172a0440","Hi ladies. Taxol #4 yesterday. It went fine, except that when the nurse asked about my side effects I mentioned that sometimes I get heart palpitations kind of on and off around mid-week so now I have to have another MUGA scan. Darn. They were much more pronounced during the A/C - I though it was the steroids but they are making me go anyway. Oh and sad news - the nurse said hair will stop growing back while on Taxol. I have a little fuzz. Ginger - I know what you mean about after chemo is over. I have a similarfear. With chemo, I feel like something is being done to make sure the cancer doesn't come back, but once I'm off. I will be taking Tamoxifen, but I still am scared. Might join a support group after chemo. I hope your sister's lump turns out benign. Charlene- When my onc put me on Taxol x12, I asked about it because of course I thought if I have to have 12 weekly instead of 4dd, I must be in much graver danger!) and he said it is just another way of doing it. They can make each tx dosage lower so the side effects are minimized further. But he also said (I think) that the overall dosage is higher. So I wonder if that is due to my age since I had only micrometastesis in one node. Abbey- I have to concur that A/C stunk. I had mine on Monday and it really kicked in Wed. evening-around Saturday afternoon. Each tx had me feeling a little worse in one way or another. But my nausea was under control. I did have Emend. My weight was stable through the A/C but I am gaining weight on Taxol, probably because my appetite has improved but my stamina has not so my exercise is way down. I hope you got to the apple orchard, and that you get to really rest on your Fridays off. Rose- I'll be doing Tamoxifen. No rads at this point but I still plan to ask my onc if we should reconsider. What are your reservations? Hope you got to your son's soccer game. Abbi- I'm having hot flashes now! I haven't had a period since July, so I guess I'm in menopause. But the hot flashes have not been bad. Interestingly, my onc said that daughters often mimic their mothers in when they go through meno. So I guess the closer you were to meno before you started chemo, the more likely you are for it to kick in during chemo. My mom said she was 47 and I'll be 43 next week. Glad you were feeling better last week. Hope you're on the upswing now. Margie - HOW COOL that you ran the Race for the Cure! Inspirational, isn't it? Ours is in June but Sunday I did the Making Strides for Breast Cancer walk. They give survivors a ""survivor"" t-shirt and a pink sash. I felt like a bald Miss America in my sash!! Take care and hopefully everyone feels OK this week.

"0035a9c4-15ed-4fa7-86f5-5c974b0da081","The fatigue and/or lack of energy is getting to me. It's not a problem when I go to the store or a municipal area, but the parking lot for the building where I work is about 1/2 block away. I have usually parked at the farthest end of the lot to get the exercise walking to my office, but now even when I park closer, I find that it is a real effort making the walk. I've given up taking the stairs up/down to my 4th floor office. Also, my therapist's office uses a parking facility a block away except for their handicapped spaces. My boss suggested that I get a temporary handicapped parking permit so I can use it if I feel I need to. If I'm feeling good, I don't have to use it. Everyone reminds me that the fatigue is only going to get worse and that, once I start the Taxol, I'll also have the neuropathy to deal with. I also live in the northeast so, not only do I have a long walk, I'll be walking in freezing temperatures. Have any of you gotten handicapped parking permits?

First treatment was yesterday and I'm still feeling fine. Just a little tired yesterday but ate well, drank lots and rinsed my mouth with baking soda and water every time I went to the bathroom. Taking claritin for the neulasta shot and had an ativan to help me sleep. The steroid had me a little wired, but the ativan helped. So far I feel good this morning. I'm not working, just driving my kids and trying to get my daughter off to overnight camp. Rambo50 I'll let know how I feel by the end of the day. I get my shot at 1:00. My nurse if I have bone pain it doesn't usually start until 24 hours after the shot and can last up to 5 days. Yuck! But it sounds like you might be able to work the day after chemo. See what the others say and have a back up plan if you're too tired or nauseous. Dxat32 - I'm sorry you have the added stress of your schedule. This is never convenient is it? I didnt have the same surgery, but my doctor was very helpful in working with me on the start date. They helped me get an echo scheduled quickly, (which I don't know if you need). Just tell the doc everything you're worried about and ask how they can help you move quickly. I wouldn't skip the training session. For me it was just 45 minutes with the nurse, but it was helpful. And you can ask to do it early while you're waiting for your start date. Try to take a deep breath and keep your head up until you can work out the schedule on Monday. Waiting stinks.

"0095dc4d-f9a9-402e-88d1-3d76ebee4cc4","I had an ECHO before each treatment. Matter of fact, my last echo was done the day before my last treatment so a cardiologist would have time to read it. Ejection Fraction up 5 percent, but I still declined the adriamycin. No thank you Sir. I'll take my chances with BC coming back rather than KNOWING I'll have heart problems. It's a no win situation, but sometimes even losers get lucky. I'm not going to blame my bad luck with cancer on anything in particular. Environmental, birth control (didn't take it), HRT, acid rain, pink hostess snowballs, recycled toilet paper, or body lotion. Like MBJ said, you just have to listen to your body. If you feel something, don't stop asking for it to be checked out, especially now. One thing I have learned though Ladies, is this: Now that you have HAD cancer. doctors are ready to listen when you come up with a symptom that COULD be cancer. They hop around here when I have the slightest bump lump or whacky mole. No waiting Ma'am, to the front of the line with you. Thank you. But, if you don't have a doctor that listens immediately, find one that does. Tons of em out there. I have two family doctors. why two? Well, one is for colds and kids, and kids colds, and allergies, the other is for lumps bumps and whacky moles, also for yearly blood work, physicals, and such. The ""cold"" doctor is a family friend who my kids have went to since they were infants. My ""lump"" doctor has been my doctor since I was a teen. He knows me. he knows my anxiety level and how much bullshit I can take before I spazz out over that there whacky mole that has been there since birth, but I think it just might be a little darker/lighter/whackier. and he doesn't judge me. I don't yet have that sort of trust with my Oncologist. Hoping for it eventually, but we haven't bonded yet. TNBC is scary, for sure. but if you listen to your body, inspect yourself regularly, and keep those all important dr's appt's, it will be kept in check. This is my second go round with BC, and both times I've caught it in its earliest stages.

"009c0cc7-d830-4f59-8001-f1c650eee129","Well I have had a few struggles with my first Taxotere treatment. I was doing great on my steroid high up until the evening of day 4. I started to get this muscle and nerve pain in my legs and up my back. I have never experienced pain like that before. I decided to take a warm bath Friday night to see if it would help with that pain. It didn't. I lay in bed waking every hour or so with muscles spasm. On top on that, Saturday morning I could see and feel something going on with the soles of my feet (particularly the heels). I think the hot bath brought on PPE (Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia) or what they call ""hand and foot syndrome"" but on my feet only. I don't think it is a severe case of it because the skin has not cracked but it is very very painful. By Saturday afternoon, I was in complete agony! I could hardly walk. I started taking Tylenol which didn't completely manage the pain but did take the edge off and icing my feet. On top of all of that, I was dealing with the Big C. Lucky for me my onco nurses recommended that I continue taking the omeprazole so I didn't get any heartburn but I do have slight and continuous stomach pain. Could just be the Big C and Big D playing with me I guess? The big C turned into the Big D on day 6. Fun stuff!! Today is day 9 post chemo, and I still can't walk properly (I shuffle around on my tippy toes) because of the PPE. I also noticed a small blood blister developed on my abdomen. I read this can occur when your platelets are low? Today's latest development is a twitchy left eye. Boy, have I got a list to discuss with my onco nurse on my next appointment on March 19th. On the plus side, I'm not fatigued but I'm not doing anything either!! I'm thinking they may have to reduce the dosage for chemo #5. I have to admit last weekend I was ready to wave the white flag on this chemo thing but now that I feel a bit better, I will see what they have to tell me. Brandi999  Hoping your first Taxol went well! Were you allowed to take a lesser dose of steroids? I'm going to ask about this as well. I had a reaction to the Zofran/Ondansetron this time. My face chin got really red with the first pill and then the redness went up to my nose with the 2nd. TeriMP  I did have a bone and CT scan but as others pointed out, they found tumor cells in 2 of my 5 sentinal nodes. I wish there was some other method to determine if cancer cells were still circulating as scans are not always 100% proof either. On the plus side, you are ER/PR positive so they have hormone therapy to help control it as well. Kristin, hope your final AC goes well and that you got to enjoy the Pizza tonight!! Sweethope  that's if fantastic news regarding your lung cat scan! I hope you get positive information from the MUGA scan as well. When will you see your MO again to discuss the BMX? I had a UMX but because of the positive nodes, I know radiation is going to be offered to me. I'm scheduled to meet with the radiologist on March 30th. Since mine is on the right, I don't have the heart concerns that you do but I'm still anxious about radiation period. Beachbum1023 - good luck tomorrow (I guess today now) on all the heart tests. I'm sorry to hear they want you to do another round of chemo. Do you know yet what one? Hopefully your MO can give you the information you need to make the best decision for yourself. I'm also wishing everyone the best managing all the chemo SE's!!

I have had absolutely no neuropathy or nail issues whatsoever. Just finished #12 of 12 weekly Taxol this week. Based on my experience, my Chemo Nurses and NP are telling other patients to do it. I bought two small dishpans for $1.00 each at the dollar store. The nurse filled them with ice. I kept on my socks and stuck feet in pan - in and out so I didn't get frostbite. For my hands, I put a washcloth over ice and inserted fingers into ice - also in and out. I did this from the minute Taxol infusion started until it was over. Blood vessels constrict and keeps chemo from going to fingers and toes. Also, brush your teeth with Baking Soda. I did this with A/C and Taxol - never had one mouth sore.

"00b8120c-7f3a-4f34-8c89-585206da4504","SUGGESTIONS FOR MASTECTOMY PATIENTS:SIZE OF TISSUE EXPANDER IS IMPORTANT AND RELATES DIRECTLY TO FUTURE IMPLANT SIZE: Visit the thread ""Breast Implant Sizing 101"" under the Breast Reconstruction topic, grab a cup of tea, and do some serious reading. The width of the tissue expander used at the time of the mastectomy will determine/limit your choices of implants. Look at the implant sizes in the catalogs for the different implant manufacturers (the links are posted at the top of the thread). Make sure that you clearly and firmly communicate your sizing deisres with your plastic surgeon. Question theplastic surgeon on tissue expander brand and size he/she has planned for you. Compare the width of that tissue expander with the implant you desire to see if they are very close in width. If not, discuss the discrepancies with your plastic surgeon prior to your mastectomy. The maximum volume of the tissue expanders is also important but there is a little more leeway with volume than width. PILLOWS: At the time of my BMX, I received two pillows in the hospital which were donated by a local quilting club. They were called Pink Ribbon Pillows. I still sleep with them today. They are cylindrically-shaped, like bolster pillows, and are about 15 inches long and 13 inches in circumference. They fit nicely along my sides under each arm. BRAS THAT FIT TISSUE EXPANDERS: No Boundaries brand bra purchased at Walmart for $4.99. Very stretchy nylon/spandex with removable foam cups. They come in lots of colors and are extremely comfortable. The foam cups will help give you some shape. I still wear these after my exchange. They look like this:BEST CLOTHING CHOICES: After BMX and especially if having lymph nodes removed, it will be very difficultto put your arms over your head to pull on type of shirt. Get some shirts that button up the front for the first couple of weeks. SHOWERING/BATHING WITH J-P DRAINS: My PS told me that I could not shower until the drains came out. Well, I could not stand myself after a couple of days! I was smart enough to have installed prior to my surgery a hand-held shower head. I put a couple of bath towels on the edge of the tub and leaned over into the tub and my dear husband washed my hair for me by using the hand-held shower head to wet/rinse my hair. In order to shower, I tied a long clean shoelace around my neck, took off the surgical bra, and attached the drains to the ribbon with safety pins. I was then able to use the handheld shower below my boobs to lather, rinse, repeat, repeat, and repeat (OMG--I never thought a shower could feel so good). I had my husband soap up my back and shoulders and then wipe them down with a dampened washcloth. I felt 100 times better after this! TOILETING: I wish someone had told me to practice wiping with my left hand prior to my BMX. I had lymph nodes removed on the right side and couldn't reach where necessary for about a week with my right hand. FINGERNAILS: I am not sure if it is due to Herceptin or Tamoxifen but after taking these drugs for about six months, my fingernails began splitting, flaking, and breaking all the way back past the edge of my fingertips! I started using OPI Nail Envy Nail Strengthener which goes on like clear nail polish, although it actually appears milky white in the bottle. It seems to be helping and my nails are now starting to grow past my fingertips but I continue to keep them as short as possible. SEATBELT DISCOMFORT: My son purchased seat belt adjuster clips at Pep Boys which allow the shoulder strap on the seatbelt to be positioned more comfortably. They were about $5 for a pair and look like this:STOOL SOFTENER: As mentioned above, just take the stool softener. It is not very expensive to purchase prior to surgery, however, I received a prescription for it upon my discharge from the hospital. Also, have some Milk of Magnesia on hand and take that as well once you get home from the hospital. All the fluids the hospital pumps you with will make you feel bloated. All the pain meds and anesthesiawill make you constipated. Need I say more? STRAWS: Purchase some ""bendy"" straws prior to your surgery. It will make it much easier for youto drink in a reclined position once you are home. PHYSICAL THERAPY: As soon as possible (within four weeks post mastectomy), get a referral for physical therapy, especially if you have had lymph nodes removed. It will work wonders with range of motion and alleviates discomfort.","after","but","3107","PDT","3001","take","break","3010","tamoxifen","3115","15","CC","to","0","and","DT","8","VBG","split","herceptin","CC","flake","drug-SE","or","NN","FALSE","way","TO","NN","VBG","all","breaking","CC","VBG","the","Tamoxifen","false","1","IN","NNP","2","false","13","invalid","NNP","8","6","8","9","1","9","44","102","63","1","137","25"

"00b8120c-7f3a-4f34-8c89-585206da4504","SUGGESTIONS FOR MASTECTOMY PATIENTS:SIZE OF TISSUE EXPANDER IS IMPORTANT AND RELATES DIRECTLY TO FUTURE IMPLANT SIZE: Visit the thread ""Breast Implant Sizing 101"" under the Breast Reconstruction topic, grab a cup of tea, and do some serious reading. The width of the tissue expander used at the time of the mastectomy will determine/limit your choices of implants. Look at the implant sizes in the catalogs for the different implant manufacturers (the links are posted at the top of the thread). Make sure that you clearly and firmly communicate your sizing deisres with your plastic surgeon. Question theplastic surgeon on tissue expander brand and size he/she has planned for you. Compare the width of that tissue expander with the implant you desire to see if they are very close in width. If not, discuss the discrepancies with your plastic surgeon prior to your mastectomy. The maximum volume of the tissue expanders is also important but there is a little more leeway with volume than width. PILLOWS: At the time of my BMX, I received two pillows in the hospital which were donated by a local quilting club. They were called Pink Ribbon Pillows. I still sleep with them today. They are cylindrically-shaped, like bolster pillows, and are about 15 inches long and 13 inches in circumference. They fit nicely along my sides under each arm. BRAS THAT FIT TISSUE EXPANDERS: No Boundaries brand bra purchased at Walmart for $4.99. Very stretchy nylon/spandex with removable foam cups. They come in lots of colors and are extremely comfortable. The foam cups will help give you some shape. I still wear these after my exchange. They look like this:BEST CLOTHING CHOICES: After BMX and especially if having lymph nodes removed, it will be very difficultto put your arms over your head to pull on type of shirt. Get some shirts that button up the front for the first couple of weeks. SHOWERING/BATHING WITH J-P DRAINS: My PS told me that I could not shower until the drains came out. Well, I could not stand myself after a couple of days! I was smart enough to have installed prior to my surgery a hand-held shower head. I put a couple of bath towels on the edge of the tub and leaned over into the tub and my dear husband washed my hair for me by using the hand-held shower head to wet/rinse my hair. In order to shower, I tied a long clean shoelace around my neck, took off the surgical bra, and attached the drains to the ribbon with safety pins. I was then able to use the handheld shower below my boobs to lather, rinse, repeat, repeat, and repeat (OMG--I never thought a shower could feel so good). I had my husband soap up my back and shoulders and then wipe them down with a dampened washcloth. I felt 100 times better after this! TOILETING: I wish someone had told me to practice wiping with my left hand prior to my BMX. I had lymph nodes removed on the right side and couldn't reach where necessary for about a week with my right hand. FINGERNAILS: I am not sure if it is due to Herceptin or Tamoxifen but after taking these drugs for about six months, my fingernails began splitting, flaking, and breaking all the way back past the edge of my fingertips! I started using OPI Nail Envy Nail Strengthener which goes on like clear nail polish, although it actually appears milky white in the bottle. It seems to be helping and my nails are now starting to grow past my fingertips but I continue to keep them as short as possible.

"00f5fed9-e6ec-4c15-9ade-6191e40f56d9","Damiana - Congratulations about your first H-only treatment. It is NOTHING like having chemo. BUT I want to share this with you - I may be all alone in this reaction, but - it took me a few times of going for H-only for my brain to realize that it wasn't going to be the same as TCH. So I would have the same anxiety/jitters/tension entering the chemo room, getting the port accessed, etc. the first few times.

Rangermom and CarlaB76 - So sorry to hear about your latest cancer challenge and wishing you both well with all your treatments, have faith for there is plenty of cancer drugs they try. I was dx stage IV from the start and that was 2 and a half years ago!!!! and I'm still here, living and breathing and most importantly loving evey moment of it. I'm on herceptin forever (which is ok cause I don't get any SE from it) but also the dreaded Tamoxifen which I do suffer SE. My mets are on both lungs and Im happy to say have stayed stable since June 2011. Pawprint - Are you off the Tamoxifen now? my SE are extreme and my weight is has balooned up to 4 stone since dx (2 stone this year), I absolutely hate the stuff and have begged the Dr's to take me off of it but they wont my ER+ status was 4/8 so I'm weakly oestrogen rich. So far I've been on it for 2 years this month, thinking of taking a Tamoxifen holiday next year of a month or 2 and I'm not gonna tell them, just need a break from this shit. I'm still going through the menopause so they told me can't change drug until I'm through it.

"01582a54-791f-485a-8003-d7753c6024d9","Dear Teakay, I finished rads last month. But prior to that I had TEN rounds / four before surgery and six after /of all sorts of chemo every three weeks, including the red devil and taxotere. All together with surgery it took me 14 months!!!! But the fact that I am doing everything possible gave me strength to go through it. I was sick, in pain some days, tired and miserable especially on days 3, 4, 5. In fact I found Taxotere worse than Adriamicin/ Doxorubicin. I lostall my hair and thought I would never feel normal again. My heart never let me down, though I had low red and white bloodcell count. But here I am, feeling good most of the time, enjoing my new short hair and doing my best to get my life back. Nothingcanbeworse than C, so everything is doable to kick the beast. Prepare yourself mentally and physically, take each day as it comes, have lots of rest, sleep, walk, tasty food, spoil yourself whenever its possible and the treatment will be soon behind you. I never thought I would say this, as at the time of the treatment it seemed endless and the side effects were bringing me down so much. I wish you lots of strength and optimism through your treatment. You can do it!!!!

The more serious SEs like blood clots and endometrial cancer are very rare with an incidence of less than 1%, but a yearly transvaginal ultrasound to monitor the uterine lining and the ovaries is a good idea.","hot","is","207","CC","169","flash","insomnia","178","tamoxifen","215","6","IN","common","0","have","NNS","2","RB","i","se","VBP","also","drug-SE","with","PRP","FALSE","but","JJ","CC","NN","and","insomnia","VBZ","NNS","achi","tamoxifen","false","1","JJ","NN","1","false","10","valid","NNP","8","69","131","25","69","44","8","28","69","44","47","44"
"0175afc2-b56a-4868-98ae-c55a4e36ad41","Wow, I have found myself wondering the very same thing. I was diagnosed Stage IV triple negative BC in April 2011. Didn't want to wait six weeks for surgery so started chemo ASAP - clinical trial with taxol (stopped after 8 months due to worsening neuropathy), avastin and placebo or evirolimus (continuing today). First scan two monthsafter chemo started showed almost all mets (breast, stomach and cervical lymph nodes) gone. Scans every two months since then have been clean. My onc does not use the word remission or even NED and, like so many others docs on this board, tells me repeatedly that it comes back, can't be cured, matter of time, blah, blah. Just had a scan today so am biting my nails hoping it too is clean but in my heart of hearts I know it will be. I've told my doc I will not be sick, I will not die and I refuse to succumb to the medical profession's dour statistics. Yes, chemo stinks and is hard, but I believe what really matters is our state of mind. Believe and enjoy life. I believe we can all get well if we stop letting them convince us otherwise!","after","stop","248","NN","201","month","neuropathi","206","taxol","258","6","IN","clinic","0","worsen","CC","5","TO","due","trial","VBG","to","drug-SE","with","JJ","FALSE","placebo","JJ","NN","NN","avastin","neuropathy","VBD","NNS","and","taxol","false","1","IN","NN","0","false","6","valid","NN","8","147","20","6","25","147","44","102","102","131","8","131"

I started chemo in November, 4 rounds of AC followed by what will hopefully be 4 rounds of Taxol. I just had my second on Friday. The Taxol has been much harder than the AC for me. Lots of muscle pain and finger pain. Anyway, I am going for a bone scan next week because the CA markers were rising with the AC and my MO wants to see if there is progression or not. If there isn't progression she would like me to see a surgeon about having the rib removed. I was orginally dx DCIS in 2008 and had bmx with silicone implants put in. The left implant sits very close to where the rib pain is the worst. I keep asking if I should have the implants taken out. If I have no progression and go forward with the surgery they will probable take them out then. Has anyone had a similar circumstance?? Rangermom, I was really happy to hear there were no new mets.

I was afraid if I was happy, something more bad would happen. Femara turned me into a shrew - I could go from being frustrated with my husband (and not saying anything) to blowing up and calling him 'whatever came to mind'. A minute of two later I would realize how inappropriate I was and would apologize. It was like being possessed. Never got getter either. And I didn't handle 'situations' at all well like I used to. If something used to be bad I could do or deal with it and when it was way over, then maybe I would have a tear of two. Femara had my hysterical at times. Finally about 3 months before I was switched to Tamoxifen due to getting mets, my GP switched me to an anti-anxiety pill to take, low dose, three times a day. Wow, in two days I noticed an overall difference and about 4 days later I actually woke up and just got out of bed. No hesitation, no anxiety. No worry that to be happy would cause my world to fall apart again (how I felt when I was diagnosed with BC). And my joints don't ache on Tamoxifen. Anti-anxiety pills I think take care of the anxiety and enable you to get in and be what you want to be and do what you want to do, which in turn lessens depression. Very few Dr's will put you on daily anti-anxiety pills and anti-depressants. They may put you daily on anti-depressants and give you a light small dose of anxiety pills to take when you need them, but I find keeping ahead of situations finds me taking less. Now on Tamoxifen I just have really bad hot flashes. Sure, I have my down days, but I'm always up by 9am (don't usually go to bed until midnight) and more often 7:30. I'm better for the anti-anxiety pills I know. Soon I'm going to try and decrease the amount I take, because then if I get bad news in the future I'm sure I'll need a full dose again for a while. My Dr also thinks being out in the sun for 20 minutes a morning before 11am without sunblock or sunglasses but you can wear a hat to shad you eyes really helps improve depression and anxiety. There is actually a syndrome: Seasonal Affective Disorder. As we live in an area that is sunny more than not, my Dr just said go outside every morning that the sun is out. I've been doing it a week and I think I feel lighter and happier. Why no sunblock or sunglasses or that it has to be before 11am, I have no idea why. Wouldn't hurt to try. Now as to being crazy.

Had a follow-up visit with the BS today on the groin excision of last week but expected to fully heal in a couple of days. we are also expecting the tissue anlysis from the research center for a treatment match.suze35 : thanks also for your insight. i remain positive and optimistic towards my treatment.to all other ladies, let's hang in there and to support one another.","of","out","154","NN","121","suspend","infect","126","taxol","163","5","VBD","NULL","0","to","NN","1","JJ","suspend","i","TO","due","drug-SE","had","VBN","FALSE","and","NULL","CC","NN","dose","infection","IN","VBN","reduct","taxol","false","1","IN","NN","0","false","3","valid","NNP","123","44","80","6","124","25","1","8","7","7","131","8"

For me, the diarrhea didn't get going until the 3rd week. By the 4th week, I was having a very bad time- cramps and very watery stools 20 times a day :-( I took more than the max of Immodium (trial nurse said to try to stay ahead of it. ) but it didn't make a dent. I do wonder if I got a tummy bug that week and that it wasn't only the Tykerb. Anyway, just then the trial protocoll changed to 750 mg whilst on Taxol (not a moment too soon for me) and within a week the diarrhea settled down to once every few days. Now I am done with Taxol and am up to 1500 mg again. I have almost NO SE's!!!! My trial nurse says that often the first month is the hardest and then things get better. She recommends taking 2 Immodium at the same time as the Tykerb to help ward off the diarrhea. She also has said that there is no danger in taking lots of Immodium since it works locally (doesn't give you constipation) and to take one every time you have a runny bathroom visit, to try to stay ahead of things. I take the Tykerb at night, because it is easier for me to remember not to eat for an hour before I go to bed than after I get up in the morning. They are huge pills but they go down easily. I recently signed some new papers for the ALTTO trial and saw that they now allow you to dissolve them in water (in a specified way, with a specified amount of water) as well. Will you be taking the Tykerb alone or with Xeloda or Herceptin? Since I started out with it at the same time as Taxol, it is hard to know how much my hard start is due to the combination. But things have really settled down and my only problems these days are that I get split finger tips, crusty nose gunk and an occaisional swelling next to a nail.

They couldn't get a blood return from my port, so took blood from my arm for labs. My numbers were almost unchanged from last treatment, which surprised me because I have been feeling so much more tired and weak and out of breath. But, it means that I don't have to take Neupogen shot tomorrow YAY. They had put clot busting medicine in port, so I had to wait another ~30 minutes before they tried to access, and it still would not get a return. ON finally put in another set with a longer needle, and voila. After that, she gave me the Benedryl - 50mg! I felt it almost immediately, and I could not stay awake. They also gave me more Dex. Then another 30 minute wait (she originally said 45) before they started the taxol so that they could be sure that the medicines were through my system. No one had mentioned that. So, it was 12:40 before I had the Taxol going - my poor sister waiting through all of this. I felt nothing, no reaction at all. So, next time I won't have to take premeds, and they may be able to back off my Benedryl too. By the time I left - 3:40 PM (got there at 9:45 AM), I did not feel any effects of the Benedryl. My sister drove, and I think I will continue to be driven to and from these, but I feel like I will be fine to drive back to Maine after I get home from next Taxol infusion. I feel fine now, maybe even a little wired, that's why I tool the ativan. Oh, I got clarification on the L-Glutamine, I started taking it today, which is the right answer - 3x a day for 3 days, 10mg. I put 2 tsp in a large glass of ice tea and drink it down. It's not bad, but I'll be glad when day 3 is over. Also, I have proved my theory that steroids get rid of the mouth sores - did I say that already? I'm rinsing still, but is this as much of an issue with Taxol? Also, mentioned the cardboard taste buds to NP, and she said she didn't hear much of that, but admitted that Taxol does mess with taste. Jeez, guess I had more to say than I thought. Thinking of all the chemo-sabes tomorrow - I'll be thinking of those going for 1st Taxol. DD is definitely a LOOONG day. So grateful to be on the other side of half way done!

"022c4572-6aff-4482-8039-d4b59899fc44","Hi Everyone, Well I don't know where to start so I will just begin and see where it takes me. First of all, I got the results back on my bone scan last friday. it was clean. What a relief, I still have pain in my hip but I can live with that. When I had the scan that weds. the tech came in at the end, real nice lady, and said she wanted to do a close up on my pelvic area. Well, I started crying and asked her so did you see something that makes you want to do this she said the only reason was because in case the dr wanted it I wouldn't have to come back. I told her ok then I said you know even if you did see something you wouldnt tell me anyways. lol. well when I got done she said I could get fired for this but it looks very good to me, so don't worry. I could have kissed her lol. I just got home from pensacola, fl thursday. I went out there on Monday. The weather was wonderful, very humid but great. We couldn't swim in the ocean though. thousands of jelly fish lined the coast, they say because of the hurricane. but we had a great pool and the bay to swim in so it was ok. I read all the posts and to kind of jump in, I know my answers are a bit late but I also had no neuropathy to speak of and I don't remember who made the comment about ""bring the taxol on"" but thats exactly how I felt. By my 4th A/C I was so sick I was happy to start something else. I had a much easier time with the taxol. My nails are still trying to recover and I haven't lost anymore. Monday I have my 4th Avastin treatment. I am going to talk to them about getting aloxi for nausea ONLY if I can have it with out steriods. I have had enough of that stuff. My hair is coming in thick and there is soooo much gray its making me want to scream. Everyone just thinks it looks great but I'm coloring it the first chance I get lol. So anymore info, Brena on that cruise???? I'm going to SF in sept. I just started worry about all the flying I'm doing, I don't want to get lymphadema but so far my arm is doing good. Well, that about sums everything up. I'm sure I missed a bunch of stuff I wanted to tell you all. And to those of you that are new, welcome to the group.

"022c4572-6aff-4482-8039-d4b59899fc44","Hi Everyone, Well I don't know where to start so I will just begin and see where it takes me. First of all, I got the results back on my bone scan last friday. it was clean. What a relief, I still have pain in my hip but I can live with that. When I had the scan that weds. the tech came in at the end, real nice lady, and said she wanted to do a close up on my pelvic area. Well, I started crying and asked her so did you see something that makes you want to do this she said the only reason was because in case the dr wanted it I wouldn't have to come back. I told her ok then I said you know even if you did see something you wouldnt tell me anyways. lol. well when I got done she said I could get fired for this but it looks very good to me, so don't worry. I could have kissed her lol. I just got home from pensacola, fl thursday. I went out there on Monday. The weather was wonderful, very humid but great. We couldn't swim in the ocean though. thousands of jelly fish lined the coast, they say because of the hurricane. but we had a great pool and the bay to swim in so it was ok. I read all the posts and to kind of jump in, I know my answers are a bit late but I also had no neuropathy to speak of and I don't remember who made the comment about ""bring the taxol on"" but thats exactly how I felt. By my 4th A/C I was so sick I was happy to start something else. I had a much easier time with the taxol. My nails are still trying to recover and I haven't lost anymore. Monday I have my 4th Avastin treatment. I am going to talk to them about getting aloxi for nausea ONLY if I can have it with out steriods. I have had enough of that stuff. My hair is coming in thick and there is soooo much gray its making me want to scream. Everyone just thinks it looks great but I'm coloring it the first chance I get lol. So anymore info, Brena on that cruise???? I'm going to SF in sept. I just started worry about all the flying I'm doing, I don't want to get lymphadema but so far my arm is doing good. Well, that about sums everything up. I'm sure I missed a bunch of stuff I wanted to tell you all. And to those of you that are new, welcome to the group. Oh and Brena, thanks for clearing up my number. so does that mean thats the number I am in the trial through out the united states or just here in kansas?

I opted to spend the money (with help from my sisters) to get a nice wig and I get compliments all the time on how cute my hair is. People don't believe me when I tell them it's a wig!

"02a1e164-1e8c-41f2-8007-d4cb33c589e4","Hi~ chemo report # 1 The infusions themselves are not bad. The adriamycin can cause some local itching in the skin around the iv but other than that it all was good. Did not eat during the infusion. Made it to my 6:00 yoga class night and felt slightly off coordination wise but the IV drugs are great and kept me going. Afterwards was invited for Italian but right around then my nausea kicked (yes all pm meds had been taken)and so I had to pass. The orals do not seem to work as well as the IV drugs. I have 0 interest in food but have not had any vomiting. This is really similar to feeling pregnant early on with twins. Chills, heavy legs, headache and def chemo brain. Don't listen to the docs that say this only happens later, bullshit! I had made sure my husband set up my meds last night and this morning because I found it confusing and was doubting myself. I do well under stress and and am sharp as a tack so this could be nothing but these drugs not the ""stress"" of it. Was told to take some extra comapazine and ativan and rest ~ sort of works but not really. Have been drinking tons of water as usual. Seems to be improving as the hours go in but now it is time for the Neulasta shot, hopefully I will be spared the bone pain from that. have my I have a feeling that I feel better at the end of the week. gagal, it sounds like so far so good for you, keep it up. On of the things we did all day yesterday was to take lots of pictures on my first chemo day. That was fun!

I started out taking Tamoxifen because I wasn't menopausal until I started chemo and the onc said we needed to wait a year before I was officially menopausal. The Tamoxifen was horrible and I took myself off it after only two months. The joint pain was so bad I could barely function, could not get out of my chair without help, couldn't kneel down or bend over without being in tears almost. He finally put me on Arimidex, although he wasn't hopeful the pain would subside since it is known for joint pain more than Tamoxifen. I have trouble differentiating between what is from the drug and what may be a se of being menopausal since all of this happened so close together. I have never been able to tell what might be from treatments, surgery or hormonal therapy and what might be the menopause. I can't tell for sure about hot flashes because it is so warm here and where I work they keep the heat up and most of us are too warm. At home I am usually comfortable at the same temp as my dh so I don't think I am having trouble there. I take my pill in the morning, but still had trouble sleeping at night until I started taking my calcium supplement at bedtime instead of in the morning. Sleeping like a baby now. The pain I had from Tamoxifen subsided almost immediately after I stopped taking it and didn't return on the Arimidex until recently. Still not as intense. I also lost 5 pounds in one week after I stopped the Tamoxifen, must have been retaining water. Recently have started having more joint pain which never subsided completely but is manageable. All my joints hurt in the morning and my toes and fingers feel swollen. Am considering going off this one too and sticking with some of the diet and nutrition recommendations on the alternative link. I have a cousin who went that route six years ago and is still cancer free. Alice Jean - to answer your question about swelling, yes I have recently noticed the same thing on my left leg.

When they come out you'll feel like a new woman and have alot more freedom of movement. I know when I peeked at my dressing for the first time while in the hospital I was surprised too at the size or lack thereof of the site. I didn't look while the nurse changed the dressing mind you. It was only when the home nurse came 2 days later to change it that I did and I was amazed at how it looked which was way less grotesque than I ever imagined. I'm not sure what I was expecting but it was neatly done. I even showed a friend that had a LX and a former nurse and she was pleasantly surprised by how it looked. With her LX she never received any drains and her bruising was so bad it looked like she have been beaten up. MerrinellYay on being finished chemo TX! Ahh the mountains, I love the mountains. Has the doctor recommended physical therapy to help with your range of motion? If not, bring it up because you're going to need to be able to hold your arm out of the way for RADS. Let us now how you get on. MtherdeeI know we all live with the dread of a reoccurance but we musn't let those thoughts take over. I started Tamoxifen about 3 months ago and honestly the only SE thus far is some warm flashes. In reading alot about SE's from T here, I decided that I would deal with any SE's if and when they arose and so far so good. Ali, I know you're were concerned about weight gain on this stuff but I haven't had any, have lost about 5 pounds. I'm not a skinny gal and never have been, prone to weight gain really. But since the steroids have worn off and I've dropped the carbo loading I was doing during TX I'm down about 15 pounds in total. Would love to lose another 15 mind you.","month","about","1335","NULL","1264","ago","warm","1273","tamoxifen","1348","12","VBD","NULL","0","some","NULL","4","VBZ","far","i","DT","is","drug-SE","start","RB","FALSE","NULL","NULL","NULL","JJ","NULL","warm flashes.","IN","RB","NULL","Tamoxifen","false","1","NNS","NNP","0","false","7","valid","PRP","102","44","80","80","80","80","44","102","129","8","8","1"

Women who are still producing estrogen from their ovaries take tamoxifen. It is pretty well tolerated but can cause uterine problems and blood clots. Women who are no longer making estrogen in ovaries are still making smaller amounts of estrogen via the adrenal glands and also fat cells. Those women take one of three drugs in the aromatase inhibitor family. Seems like people complain more about quality of life se's from these drugs, joint pain, etc. So far the latter, AIs, are not available as generics and are pretty expensive. Tamoxifen is much cheaper. And women who can't handle AIs can usually switch to Tamoxifen and do okay. But not vice versa. Either of these drugs are prescribed to reduce the risk of metastasis to bone, brain, liver or lung more than recurrence in breast tissue, I THINK. That's why they are used in even women who have had mastectomies. They are also used in Stage IV patients to shrink tumors, even make them disappear. and seem to do a good job at it! I am not sure how having only DCIS affects this process. Since the cancer cells are in situ maybe you do not have to worry about cells traveling elsewhere in your body so no need for hormonal TX. I don't know. That's pretty general but I think I have it right. It's all so confusing at first but you will get enough info to make the right decision for you.

Women who are still producing estrogen from their ovaries take tamoxifen. It is pretty well tolerated but can cause uterine problems and blood clots. Women who are no longer making estrogen in ovaries are still making smaller amounts of estrogen via the adrenal glands and also fat cells.

One thing I am curious about. I read about the extreme tearing, think it was a Jeannie who posted that. have any of the rest of you had that. I actually had little tubes put in my eyes to correct that after I did abraxane. And how about neuropathy? My onco said neuropathy was not a SE with this,but I read that is could be. I have beenvery fortunate with the treatments that I have done thus far and am hoping that there will not be a lot of them with Havalen? Also someone mentioned nails?

I have been constipated for about 9 months anyway due to Navelbine and Gemzar. I have liver mets which have increased in size and number which is why we are looking for a new treatment. One thing I am curious about. I read about the extreme tearing, think it was a Jeannie who posted that. have any of the rest of you had that. I actually had little tubes put in my eyes to correct that after I did abraxane. And how about neuropathy? My onco said neuropathy was not a SE with this,but I read that is could be. I have beenvery fortunate with the treatments that I have done thus far and am hoping that there will not be a lot of them with Havalen? Also someone mentioned nails? Have any of you had your nails lift and become loose. And what's with the sore throat?. did you all get that. I really appreciate any info you can give me about your experiences with the drug.

Not bad pain, more of a dull ache, but it is annoying. Tylenol doesn't help at all, and I can't take NSAIDs. My MO never admits that anything is caused by the drugs. Just says things like ""headaches are common,"" or ""every woman gains weight after menopause"" or ""lots of things cause pain and fatigue"". So, yeah, no help there. The decision will have to be mine. I couldn't tolerate tamoxifen, so far anastrazole is not as bad, so I will hang in there until I can't, and then try something else.","that","and","160","CC","86","'s","dull","97","anastrazol","169","15","VBG","short","0","a","PRP","4","IN","more","after","DT","of","drug-SE","start","JJR","FALSE","is","RB","VBZ","JJ","but","dull ache","CC","VBZ","it","anastrazole","false","2","DT","NN","0","false","5","valid","IN","102","102","1","44","44","8","25","8","-1","8","8","25"

Because I'm nowhere neargetting better at all. But you give me hope! And yes, as soon as I quit Femara in November, I DID begin to sleep! WOW! What a total LUXURY! And truely, soon after I quit femara, I suddenly WAS capable again, of filling in blocks of the NYT Crossword Puzzle. (Although still cant remember so grea, in general). And maybe there is less hair on the white bathroom tiles. And maybe my knees actually ARE getting back to their old arthritic being, not the new, super-duper, ever worsening constant pain. My zest Is returning, and I missed it most of all. Zest is my middle name. But slowly. I feel zesty, make plans only to have to back out because I'm still a weak old lady. I also dont have the AI insatiable appetite! Glory be! How great is THAT? I broke out of ""training"" and bought a box of Trader Joe's frozen ready-to-bake brownies on a freezing day. And found. they really arent so good. Need vanilla. This is 3rd day and still about half left. I truely crave some nice chard, rather than vanilla-less brownies from a mix! While on Femara-this would NEVER have happened. I would have vaccuumed up ALL the brownies the first day! Binney, dont worry about your weight, because you're no longer an insatiable eating machine!

Tamox does cause problems. 1 said no, it does not. In my case I think it did. As noted above I have been having abdominal pain/bladder problems since mid Sept. After many Dr.'s visits and ultrasounds. I found out Thurs.my uterus is full of fibroids, 1 is 9 cm and squishing my bladder. (my uterus is the size of a 15 week pregnancy!?) My ovaries have fluid around them which may designate cysts. Uterine lining is very thick. I have opted to have my uterus removed (on 11/25), I am tired of the constant pain and discomfort. and bladder issues. My Onc. said to take the ovaries too. I am ok with this I guess, less risk of future cancers. BUT. I am a bit scared of no HRT and going cold turkey. Anyone have experience with this? I think I'm part way thru menopause. will it be less of a crash?? Debbie, we've talked on another thread but I can't remember. have you had an ultrasound?

I don't think I can afford to risk the destruction of my kidneys for whatever benefit tamoxifen might offer me for treatment of breast cancer"" concerns me.

"04416cf8-0817-40a3-8549-746befb92569","Hi eveyone, I usually post on the stage IV thread but was asked to share my story here. In June, 2009 I was told that I had metastatic cancer of unknown origin. I had so many mets that they could not find the primary ( lungs, spleen, biliary tract, bones, pericardial sac, chest wall, lymph nodes, uterus. ). So, I was given a cocktail of Xeloda and Gemzar to see what it did to me. After a few months, it was decided that I had Triple Negative breast cancer. Since then, I have gone through the original Xeloda/Gemzar, Doxil, Taxol and Navelbine. The Navelbine seemed to work the best of all of the regimens, reducing the mets significantly. Howver, I began to have an auto-immune reaction to the Navelbine, much similar to rheumatoid arthritis. In March, the reaction was so severe that I could not get out of bed for 3 days and lost most of my hair. My onc decided to give me a chemo break, saying he did not want the chemo to kill me. He also said that he had never seen a reaction like mine to the Navelbine and suspected that the auto-immune reaction might be attacking the cancer. So yesterday a PET scan was done:NED! I am stunned. I still cannot believe it! I went from being told 5 years ago to put my affairs in order to yesterday being told it is all gone. It's like waking up from a nightmare. I cried more yesterday than I have cried in the past 5 years, like a dam just burst and everything came flowing out. I am not sure how long NED will last or what the next steps are since my onc gave me the news over the phone. He was also so emotional that all he could say was, ""Good news, it's gone. Have a nice weekend"" as his voice choked up. So this morning I woke up to a rainy day, but I don't care. In my heart, it's a great day! Never give up!

My son recently had to do a course on performance enhancing drugs and tamoxifen is a banned substance in the sports world!. This made me curious so i did some research. tamoxifen is a common drug for body builders to use at the end of a anabolic steroid cycle. apparently excess testosterone is converted to estrogen in the body even in men. tamoxifen prevents lactation and research shows it improves definition and muscle hardness in body builders.

And there IS a sister here whose onc pronounced her a veritable ""estrogen factory"". I She is in her 40s, I think. She had horrible times on Femara, and took to skipping lots of days of taking the pill(if at all)We do these things because of the intense suffering. If you dont have it, you cant imagine it! But that sister had a reaction such as you mention. Trouble. I say again that I am only getting away with it because I'm old. And I repeat, I think oncs should prescribe AI dosage according to the woman's estrogen state! If a woman is having poor QOL on AI, it would behoove her onc to test for estradiol. And if it is very low, try gradually lessening her dose of AI, while constantly watching estrogen value. This way, (albiet SLOWLY) perhaps a level of blood AI could be reached that held estrogen at a decent level AND gave better QOL. In a perfect world, I would request this for myself, because my dosage of Femara is still giving me LOTS of pain, and fatigue , and cognitive difficulties. My head is still filled with cotton, and I've learned how not to fall when the dizziness comes on. I would love to approach the .5 dosage of Femara. Which I'm still WAAAY above.

"04c33fbc-a9b3-4258-aaec-73f999603210","Tenderis, Please dont be the least hesitant to post anything which may be on your mind. You're a pretty newbie here, we dont know you, nor have we experienced your bc progression with you. And you dont know us (or the really brilliant women among us. )Many seem to have taken a back seat recently, who were so helpful and elucidating ""before"" (The boards have been through some changes of recent. )This theory you have reported is actually known to us old AI-takers. It has been discussed. You're welcome to discuss it more to your heart's content. Are you a person who works in medical labs? Which AI are you on, and for how long? It is obviously going very well for you. What was your dx? Did you have nodes affected? I, for one know none of these answers. You sprang one day, full-grown, from the head of not Venus, butBCO ! The only AI which is being downsized by users is Femara. I think Arimidex has a hard coating. And Aromasin-a whole different ball of wax. Users of other AIs, that I know of may skip pills. Or take the drug much less than they are. suppsed to! The cancer growing in an estrogenless environment and then going wild if in a more estrogen-full setting, as I said, has been reported. One sister's onc taught her this theory. How could you know this? You've just arrived! Thank you for trying to help! The Buzdar .5 trial s being shoved under the mat, but still could be Googled last year, after asking pertinant Qs. Edge knows of it (and agrees with it. )Edge is a world-famous researcher in our field. He has told me things are VERY different in Europe, where QOL is more important. He didnt say ""and profit LESS important"", and neither will I. I DEFINATELY do not hope to encourage others to cut their pills or skip doses of AI. I've actually never mentioned it here, not wanting to be a boat-rockerAlthough the key word is THEORY. It has never been observed to be true, there has never been a trial. But I'm the oldest woman I know here. And I know how desperately important estrogen inhibition is in younger women! My personal experience is no example for anyone else here! I'm OLD!! I probably dont have a whole lot of estrogen going for me WITHOUT AI. And my onc keeps VERY close watch on me. I'm 4 +years out, and he still sees me every 3 months. Yes I've had 3 long vacations, but my onc draws for CA-27, and estradiol every 3 months. And yes I cut some of my pills, but again, I'm very closely monitored, and I'm 66-16 years post meno! My onc would PREFER I not do these things, but he is very aware that I might just quit the drug entirely! As many, many sisters here , of all age groups,have actuallydone. I've seen newbies to the HT board here come on quite often and say they cant even fathom taking a drug which gives all these possible SEs. They refuse it, or insist on staying on tamixifen. My onc also cares about QOL. He has actually offered me to switch to tamox. But I'm afraid to open that can of worms., and he wasnt so pleased about the offer. And there IS a sister here whose onc pronounced her a veritable ""estrogen factory"". I She is in her 40s, I think.

"04ea7e2a-cb28-4293-8044-f93ab120e3e1","Am I allowed to throw a pity party while waiting? I've had a rough few weeks, and now the eternal waiting. I had a cold a few weeks ago, and it left me with a cough that just won't go. Antibiotics did nothing, so my doc wants X-rays ""just in case"". I have been having pain in my leg and knees (particularly the left one) which might be arthritis, side effects of Tamoxifen, old age and overweight, or it might be the tumor in my leg saying hello. And sometimes my whole left thigh aches so I can hardly walk. My arm (on the mastectomy side) has felt weird since surgery. I put it down to nerve damage from the butcher - oops I mean surgeon - who took my boob and 24 lymph nodes. But last week my physio put a tape measure around my arm, and now I am in a compression sleeve for lymphodema. I had my regular 3 monthly visit with my oncologist (the one who looks about 20 - and no, not cute) and he sent me for urgent x-rays on leg and lungs. I should get the x-ray results on Monday, and hopefully scans as well. Until the last few weeks I thought I was doing really well - back to work full time, living an almost ""normal"" life, then everything packed in all at once. My shrink tried to teach me mindfulness, but it's not working. My arm aches, my scar aches, my leg aches, my knees click when I move, my contract job finished today, so I'm pretty much unemployed, and i just want to crawl into bed and pull the blankets over my head until it's time to get the scans.","age","old","481","IN","363","and","ach","372","tamoxifen","486","21","IN","side","0","thigh","PRP","6","JJ","whole","effect","NN","left","drug-SE","of","JJ","FALSE","can","NN","MD","NNS","so","aches","JJ","CC","i","Tamoxifen","false","2","NN","NNP","0","false","10","invalid","NNS","8","131","1","44","44","8","129","129","25","1","2","137"

Brief background, wife, mother of 2 girls (baby was 8 months when diagnosed), full time job, etc. So, to say the least, juggling everything was my middle name! The reason I wanted to jump in here is because I know many of you ladies are in the middle of treatment, exhaustion, etc. and I want you to know that there is LIGHT at the end of the tunnel! My energy level is back, I have a demanding job and I finally feel like I am back in it! I travel for work a few times a quarter, too! My hair is at a great length, other than the weight gain (blah)- this is due to the Lupron shots (to keep me in menopause), Tamoxifen and every 6 months I go for Zometa infusions which also has steroids in the mix! I am so grateful for these boards, as I like to check in on my sisters. and when I have questions, I can ask away!

I would literally forget that I was on treatment (that's certainly not the case with taxoterrible! :-)) I worked great for about 9 months before my cancer became resistant. I had a little neuropathy with it, but totally manageable, in fact I was able to train for and run a half marathon while being on it. It beat up my blood counts too, so I would end up taking neupgen to make sure my counts stayed high enough.

"05912d68-da95-46a6-8047-958331647ed1","Hello, I just posted for the first time less than a week ago and just today found this link. I started AC at the end of February, have completed 4 DD rounds of AC and will have my third of 12 weekly Taxol this Thursday, after which I'll get6 1/2 wks of rads. So far, so good on the Taxol! Much better than AC, although between the anti nausea meds and daily exercise, which I'm told has really helped me, I was never nauseated on the AC - just felt slower and always had what I call a ""pewey"" taste in my mouth. Lost 5 lbs and have only put back on a pound or two with my much improved Taxol appetite. Hope the tinny taste I've heard about w/Taxol never comes my way. As posted elsewhere, I lost one big toenail on AC (unusual) and the other one doesn't look great, but it's hanging on. I decided to put some polish on my nails (including the ""iffy"" one) so I can look normal in sandals. Have a bandage over my big toe w/no nail when I go out. It makes me feel great to look down and see almost normal toenails! I'm using frozen booties and gloves while Taxol is being administered to hopefully prevent more nail loss and lessen the chance of neuropathy, which sounds so bad mostly because it lingers on indefinitely for many. Re hair - just some white with a little of my normalbrown peeking through, but I read somewhere that when it's starting to come back in, it often looks whitish because there's no melatonin in the new hair, and that your regular hair may come in later. Anyway, it will be many months of wearing my caps to the gym and my wig when I goout. Am losing eyebrow hairs, but enough are still there, and had the longish eyelashes (guess that's because they're getting ready to fall out:-). I use an eyelash curler before mascara and for the first time ever this morning, my hand moved and I accidentallyyanked out about 5 of them. Ugh! All things considered, I consider myself very lucky to have tolerated the treatment as well as I have at this point. I've had a few pesky SE's which delayed my Taxol by one week, but could be awhole lot worse. I'm getting a lot from the courage of you ladies who are also plowing through all of this.

So, if fat tissue produces estrogen, and weight gain is a side effect of Tamoxifen then it feels like taking this drug is sort of like spinning my wheels. I was wondering how many ladies gained weight on Tamoxifen? Is it water weight? Metabolism? How have you battled it? Has anyone found that diet/exercise changes countered the weight gain? I've already gone on such a strict diet that I am wondering if I will be able to eat at all! Thanks for any input.

"0677ec1e-c630-4fb0-86d9-a52514183900","Greetings All! I hopped over here from the May chemo group, thought I would share a list I had compiled for side effects. It is not ""all inclusive"". Check the other links,like Melrose has above too, research is your best friend. Please keepin mind this is not a complete list, and be sure to check with your doctor prior to """"self prescribing"". These tips were picked up from reading posts on the BCO website. What to bring to the ""chemo room"" I've heard some people say to bring a light blanket or sweater as the chemo rooms can be cold. (Me personally, I am always warm, so I had no complaints, and my location offered warmed blankets!) Pack a snack, sandwich or other food as you might be there for a long time. Mine started at 10:00 and lasted to 2:30. Bring lots of water to drink or other liquids-purpose is to flush out those toxins. Also hydrate earlier in the morning prior to chemo as it makes finding those veins eaiser. Bring a book, laptop, DVD player, iPod or those types of things to keep busy. My stack of unread magazines at home could get me through 20 chemo sessions! I brought my own cooler bag, filled it with frozen veggies and baggies of ice cubes to ice my fingers and toes to ward off neuropathy. But, keep in mind that some recommend against doing that! See if your location has ice chips, or bring ice/icee. If you are getting taxotere you will want frozen stuff in your mouth to ward off mouth sores. My taxotere drip is about one hour, I sucked once and froze my toes and fingers for most of that time (when I wasn't running to the bathroom to relieve myself from all the liquid I drank in the am!) I think that was it on what to bring, checkbook for the co-pay? Lol As for home I had on hand: Prescribed steroids Claritan 24 hour -for day of Neulasta shot and 7 days following (ward off bone pain) Prilosec for heartburn (and I needed it on the day after chemo!) Nausea meds as was prescribed and filled prior to chemo (and I did need them) Stool softener-took one am and pm Miralax- took recommended dose in the am just for a few days til off nausea meds Biotene mouth rinse, used after every meal to rinse out mouth for first 3 or 4 days Biotene gum, used to remoisturize my mouth not used too often Baking soda- used with salt and water as a mouth rinse when felt strange Benadryl-did not need Acidophilus -did not need Eye moisture drops-did not need Water or other liquids. drink , drink, drink, flush out those toxins! I had one of those giant Poland spring waters next to my armchair when I got home and just kept refilling my glass of water. later the day 2 or 3 added some iced tea mix to my water or tried other things with flavor Baby wipes ultra sensitive (or personal wipes) to wipe with after toilet use. clean off those toxins, used for first 4-5 days Bottle to cleanse self (did not have, but read about) similar to like after giving birth, to squirt on yourself as you urinate to help rinse off those toxins as you go. Plastic utensils as things get a metalic taste. Thermometer- to check your temp,they will tell you what temp they consider high and to call them (listen!) Tissues (preferably lotion ones). For runny nose that is bound to happen Hand sanitizer. keep in car or handbag, use when out and about I put the meds I would use daily on the kitchen table in a bowl. The other ""back up meds"" were in a shoebox type container on my living room table. Was very convenient to have like that so I could put away for next time! (Or if had people in!) Also used a check off list to make sure I didn't forget to take am/pm meds. And my husband could see what I needed in the am by looking at the list (was too tired to get out of bed one morning, so mumbled for him to being me my meds and he knew exactly which ones.) To keep track of side effects from chemo check out this link www.cancer.org/acs/groups/cont. For a free headscarf check out this site www.goodwishesscarves.org/ I think that is most everything.

"06988738-eb53-4d59-8148-05184c9b4da9","Just found this topic and have lots of questions. First, a bit about my HER2/neu status. My biopsy results came back as strongly negative for HER2 by the IHC test. Then the FISH came back strongly positive (a ""discordant"" result). After my surgery, they repeated the FISH test using more material from the tumor. It came back indeterminate: 1.94, 6 points below the cutoff for being positive and receiving herceptin. My oncologist talked it over with others and decided that they ""wouldn't deprive me of the benefits of herceptin"" just because I was a few points too low. Right now I'm going through the first round of chemo (AC), but will be starting the TH part in the summer once the AC is done. I've scanned through a lot of the previous posts on this topic, so I've got an idea of what to expect SE wise. I have two questions at this point. First, I noticed some people had had a MUGA test prior to starting the Herceptin. Is that standard? Who has or hasn't had it prior to starting? Second, as a result of the PET scan I had for BC staging, I was diagnosed with a tumor in my thyroid. The surgery for that will be in the fall, after the Taxol is done, but during the Herceptin-only part of my chemo. I'm a bit worried about how it will be to have surgery while on the Herceptin. Has anyone had surgery (any sort, including reconstruction) while on Herceptin? If anyone has any thoughts or experience with this, I would welcome any information. I'm a bit concerned in general about the Herceptin because I have high blood pressure and a family history with lots of heart problems.

I've not had any radiation and this has been my only chemo. regimine since my dx in Aug. (Started chemo Oct. 2). I don't have PET scan until Dec. 29 so don't know how it's working. I'm hoping for good results like some of you ladies. I have mets to the liver also , several lesions 2 large (8 cm) Liver function is also normal and I have no effects from it or the mets in the nodes (either that or I'm too new at this to know what the effects are). Side effects have been very tolerable. Tired on day 2 and 3 (I think some of it is from the anti nausea meds because when I stop those I feel better within hours.) No nausea at all. Dry mouth and stuffy/bloody nose (onc says that's from the avastin). Some loss or at least dulling of taste - comes back throughout the week. No neuropathy yet though I've always had minor tingling in my feet from plantar faciitis (sp) from being on my feet all day teaching 5th graders. Do have achycollarbone occasionally, though that might be from the mets or the way the port is placed. I had some facial and chest flushing a couple of times the day after treatment. Only lasted a couple of hours and then went away. Onc said that's normal - due to blood pressure from avastin - and not a problem as long as it goes away. Lost most of the hair on my head around week 3 - today onc and nurses confirmed it is growing back! It is about 1/4 inch all over and filling in. The nurses and doc were very surprised to see it coming back during treatment especially the way it is fillng in. Good luck and keep us posted!

"07cf05ad-cc78-4fec-bd81-f1140c4eb410","Baby, heart failure runs in my family on both sides, so I turned down my MO's suggestion of adriamycin. He agreed and after the taxotere/carboplatin (1 dose) fiasco, he put me on taxol. I did a lot of research to make sure that it wasn't cardiotoxic and it isn't. I had a herceptin vacation (6 weeks) because my LVEF went from >70% to 55% all of a sudden. I'm still at 55% but getting herceptin and another echo. We shall see. If they take me off it after this treatment, that will be ok because I've done ~ 3/4 of a year. But I also know I was highly Her2 neu +. decisions, decisions. The beta blocker will help with your EF (Arlene is right), but so does cardiovascular exercise. In fact that is probably the best way to build the EF (in line behind maintaining a normal BP). Keep yourself very hydrated to avoid a low BP and get on that treadmill (I know, easy for me to say). I am the Midwestern Queen of Sleep. I'm like Ashla, could sleep standing up. The only time I ever got insomniac was with the oral steroids before and after chemo and at the end of radiation. I understand why with the steroids (those things are EVIL!) but I think with radiation I had reached the point of utter exhaustion. Do you know what I mean, you are so tired you are wired? Anybody get tested for c. diff after all of their treatments? I'm still having issues with the big D and I think I'm too far out from chemo to have these problems.

At the bottom of my post is some other cream with out hormones. Sexuality and Reproductive Issues (PDQ) - Factors Affecting Sexual Function in People With CancerSexual dysfunction may be multifactorial; both physical and psychological factors contribute to its development. Physical factors include functional damage secondary to cancer therapies, fatigue, and pain. In addition, cancer therapy such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and bone marrow transplantation may have a direct physiologic impact on sexual function. [1] Medications used to treat pain, depression, and other symptoms may contribute to sexual dysfunction. Psychological factors include misbeliefs about the origin of the cancer, guilt related to these misbeliefs, coexisting depression, changes in body image after surgery, and stresses to personal relationships that occur secondary to cancer. [2,3] Increasing age is often believed to be associated with decreased sexual desire and performance; however, in one study, elderly men reported that sex remains important to their quality of life, that performance can be maintained into the 70s and 80s, and that altered sexual function is distressing. [4]Treatment-Related Factors Secondary to SurgeryA number of cancer treatments have a direct physiologic impact on sexual function. As treatment success has improved for some sites, attempts have been made to modify treatment to reduce sexual morbidity. Several predictors of postoperative sexual functioning include patient's age, premorbid sexual and bladder functioning, tumor location, tumor size, and extent of surgical resection. Breast cancerSexual function after localized treatment for breast cancer has been the subject of a good deal of research. Several reviews concur that breast conservation or reconstruction have only a minor impact in preserving sexual function compared with a mastectomy alone. [5,6] Women who have breast conservation, in particular, are more likely to continue to enjoy breast caressing, but groups typically do not differ on less subtle variables such as the frequency of sex, ease of reaching orgasm, or overall sexual satisfaction. A cross-sectional survey of younger women (aged 50 years or younger) with breast cancer found in multivariate analyses that having a mastectomy was associated with greater problems in interest in sex; chemotherapy was associated with greater sexual dysfunction. [7] Other studies confirm that sexual quality of life is disrupted more among those receiving chemotherapy, those who have undergone total mastectomies, those whose cancers were detected at later stages, and those with more depressive symptoms near the time of diagnosis. [8] Adjuvant tamoxifen therapy increases the rate of hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal discharge, and increases the risk of premature menopause in women older than 45 years by approximately 10%. Furthermore, though rates of sexual activity with a partner did not decline, women taking tamoxifen reported slightly increased rates of difficulty with sexual arousal and achieving orgasm. [9,10]Few studies evaluate sexuality in women with breast cancer that recurs. One longitudinal study compared women who were recently diagnosed with recurrent cancer with matched patients who were disease free. The recurrence group had less frequent intercourse, although there were no differences in sexual or relationship satisfication. As noted in other studies of women with breast cancer, sexual changes were more common among younger patients. [11]I found this also. Vaginal Atrophy, also known as Atrophic Vaginitis can cause a number of side effects that can make sexual activity uncomfortable and even painful. A lack of lubrication or vaginal dryness is one of the most common complaints for women experiencing this condition. Lyriana is a world-wide patented topical gel that can help:Clinical studies have proven Lyriana's effectivenessin treating symptoms of vaginal atrophy.

[5,6] Women who have breast conservation, in particular, are more likely to continue to enjoy breast caressing, but groups typically do not differ on less subtle variables such as the frequency of sex, ease of reaching orgasm, or overall sexual satisfaction. A cross-sectional survey of younger women (aged 50 years or younger) with breast cancer found in multivariate analyses that having a mastectomy was associated with greater problems in interest in sex; chemotherapy was associated with greater sexual dysfunction. [7] Other studies confirm that sexual quality of life is disrupted more among those receiving chemotherapy, those who have undergone total mastectomies, those whose cancers were detected at later stages, and those with more depressive symptoms near the time of diagnosis. [8] Adjuvant tamoxifen therapy increases the rate of hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal discharge, and increases the risk of premature menopause in women older than 45 years by approximately 10%. Furthermore, though rates of sexual activity with a partner did not decline, women taking tamoxifen reported slightly increased rates of difficulty with sexual arousal and achieving orgasm. [9,10]Few studies evaluate sexuality in women with breast cancer that recurs. One longitudinal study compared women who were recently diagnosed with recurrent cancer with matched patients who were disease free. The recurrence group had less frequent intercourse, although there were no differences in sexual or relationship satisfication. As noted in other studies of women with breast cancer, sexual changes were more common among younger patients. [11]I found this also. Vaginal Atrophy, also known as Atrophic Vaginitis can cause a number of side effects that can make sexual activity uncomfortable and even painful. A lack of lubrication or vaginal dryness is one of the most common complaints for women experiencing this condition. Lyriana is a world-wide patented topical gel that can help:Clinical studies have proven Lyriana's effectivenessin treating symptoms of vaginal atrophy. So if you're tired of trying temporary lubricants and want to avoid potentially dangerous hormonal treatments, learn more about Lyriana and discover why it has turned around so many women's sex lives.

Sorry you find yourself here, but I think you will feel right at home. In my experience with Taxotere the SEs came and went and changed with each cycle, usually starting about 4-5 days after the infusion. I would make sure the headache isn't from dehydration. That is exactly how I feel when I get dehydrated. Usually a few glasses of water takes care of it. If it persists I would mention it to your doctor. As for the pain, mine was usually joint pain and mostly in the hips. It was like a deep ache, almost like you get when you have the flu. Did the pain in your shoulder go away? If not, I would bring it up. Good luck to you both. Hope everyone else is doing well and enjoying summer! Mikarae - stay safe and away from those fires! Your fart comment made me laugh and laugh. RonnieKay - I had a second opinion at a new institution yesterday (mainly for piece of mind and to have my info available for possible clinical trials) and she mentioned that there is a lot of debate right now about whether or not Perjeta should be dropped after a certain amount of time. She said there aren't any studies about how long it should be given because ""Herceptin and Perjeta are both made by the same drug company, so they don't have any incentive to look into it"".

The study that came to the conclusion Tamox decreased recurrence rate by 44.2% had an actual 2.97% difference in women who did and did not take Tamox and had a recurrence years 0-4. I understand the math is not incorrect it's a matter of wording but less than 3% was the difference. Not substantial enough to spend my days in misery for. years 5-9 had less than a 1% actual difference. I say research and make a decision you feel is right. If I choose to quit Tamoxifen and have a recurrence or secondary I can honestly say I would not feel guilty for having quit it. Breast Cancer is a scary, horrible thing and we should be able to deal with it as we see fit, it's our bodies and our lives after all.

After chemo and rads, there's nothing more for me, unlike you hormone+ ladies. Don't you have to take the Herceptin for 5 years? Hopefully, it will hold the BC at bay. So, your docs say ""no"" to chemo because it may cause more neuropathy? Can't they come up with a chemo combo that would fit you better? Hmmm. Taxol gave me neuropathy in my fingers and toes, but it is fading. It did, however, make my legs 'gumby-like', and 1 month past my last chemo, my left leg is still weak and crazy. My left leg has gotten hit by MS attacks in the past, so it seems that the chemo affected my weaker parts. I just had my 6-month MRI, and I am stable - NO NEW lesions! I made it through all the stress of BC diagnosis, surgery, chemo and now rads with my MS stable Whew!!! My neuro is not sure about my leg - says to give it more time - it could still be from chemo (hopefully). I asked her about disease progression - could be, but my symptoms/neuro exam were all the same, just a little weaker. Okay - I'll try to be patient. Nana, sounds like we have similiar MS symptoms, ie: balance, fatigue, etc, but mobile (in that wobbly-sort of way! ), so I'm wondering why they are so against chemo. Do you think your age is really that major of a factor? (I'm 58). How long have you had MS? Maybe that is a major factor? Thanks for the info on Copaxone. I will be starting it this month. My neuro thinks that it would be the safest, at this time, for me. I'll see a neuroimmunologist at OHSU in Portland, OR in June. They have an excellent MS center there, where they run many trials and studies, so hopefully, they'll be able to give my doc a well-proven second opinion.

If I was HER2 and ER positive I think I would press my doc to do ovarian suppression at the same time with Lupron or Zoladex. It is being studied right now to help preserve fertility post chemo. My MO gave me Zoladex before my 5th dose and it covered my final two rounds. We think it contributed towards the increased muscular pain I had towards the end of chemo and afterwards for weeks. So not nice but if it helps to shut down the cancer cell line more then why not ? Some premenopausal gals in my chemo group are doing ovarian suppression with arimidex, it is also supposed to be more effective than just hormonal treatment (forgetting the name of the estrogen blocking drug).---Someone wanted to know why I had my SND after chemo. I had a number of enlarged nodes at the time if my diagnosis and the biopsied node contained cancerous cells. We already knew that I was stage 3B and doing an SND wouldn't change that. My objective was to cause the least amount of damage to my body while treating my cancer. My surgeon and team worked with me on achieving that, plus I had the advantage if a type of breast cancer that responds really well to neoadjuvant treatment. Left to the decision making by most oncology teams I would have been recommended a mastectomy and ALND with adjuvant treatment.

Cougar, So sorry to hear your results are mixed, but so glad they are trying to get you into surgery soon. Betterday, Yahooooooooooo! So glad to hear your results, but I would be furious with that nurse, and i would make a point of discussing it with your doctor at your next appointment, so they know the impact of their communication breakdown. There is no excuse for that. My SLNB was during my surgery, so they did the injection a couple hours before. i did have a lymph node. non cancerous side. removed 2 years ago because it was swollen, and i could always feel it, making it worrisome. It was not a big deal, but did have a bit of bruising also. Knightzoo, LOL at throwing things. My hubby never wakes up either. The kids don't even bother going to him when he is asleep! Glad to hear your pain is decreasing. LHl, Are you taking tamoxifen? I have on and off joint pain from that, but not as bad as you describe. I hope you get relief. Just found out at church this morning that my son will be confirmed the last weekend of Sept. they are 90% sure of the date. I told the youth director, i need to know the date asap!!!

I have been on Lupron and Tamoxifen since February of 2006 and except for some mild hot flashes, I haven't experienced any major side effects.

"0b1e9e1d-327e-4c94-a1ed-8bf14de65590","Lemondrop, don't beat yourself up over the late mammo. I had five years of regular clear mammos and I still wound up with ILC (2 c/stage II/grade 1), like you. I found mine through a BSE in August, and had a clear mammo in Dec 2010. ILC hides from mammos and the only way they confirmed that I had an abnormality was through an ultrasound and later confirmed BC through a lumpectomy. I've just finished my second of four rounds of AC, then I'll be doing 12 weekly rounds of Taxol. Then bmx, reconstruction and radiation. My hair is just starting to fall out and to be honest, I've had enough time to prepare for all of this and am not too worried about it--just want to get through and get on with life. I'm annoyed by it, mostly. You will walk through this and come out strong and healthy on the other side. I think of all this as rather like being pregnant. Your world changes overnight when you find out, your body changes and feels out of control, you don't recognize yourself in the mirror, your tastes change, you feel queasy. fatigued. and it seems to take about 9 months for chemo, surgery, radiation and recovery. And your world is never the same again after a dx. But I do think beauty comes out of this uncertain time in our lives, like a child brings beauty to us, and it won't forever.

I am looking forward to my hair growing back. I love hats such as my bolero for the winter months. But without hair, it won't be the same this year. However, being bald is sooooo much easier. Washing my face and head at the same time - Piece of cake. Putting on face cream - don't have to worry about getting cream into my strands of hair. And like Madalyn said we gals with fine hair don't have to worry about the hair flattening out. Oh and the hair clog in the drain - don't blame me! Aylin and Barb, FYI, as a runner, I opted to go with Taxotere vs. Taxol because of the risk of peripheral neuropathy with Taxol. So far so good - 5 weeks out and no neuropathy.

"0ccaecf6-50d6-4e30-87c9-f83dac9ee900","the good fight - I hope your doctors have some ideas you end up being happy with. I know a couple of people on this board have been given Abraxane instead of Taxotere when there has been a problem with severe allergic reaction, so you may want to ask about that. You could also ask them about FEC - it's used a lot in the UK and elsewhere with public systems instead of AC (and presumably, based on the taxotere cost, TC). Anniegranny - on the peripheral neuropathy and nail beds, you could ask your oncologist if they have the cold gloves Sanofi Aventis makes. I wore these - they look like hockey goalie mitts and your hands get so cold you almost can't stand it, but when you think you can't take it any longer, they start to wear off and it's fine. If not you canputan ice pack onyour hands, as some have suggested. My oncology nurse also recommended either dark nail polish or clear nail hardener. I did the nail hardener on fingers and toes in addition to the gloves (which were hands only) and only ever had extremely mild finger sensitivity for a day or so in a couple of the cycles. For people who are finishing up, my oncologist recommended continuing wearing the nail hardener for a few weeks post-chemo, which I did. I agree with all the comments on hair. The end of my last cycle was about 8 weeks ago (last infusion 11 weeks ago) and I have between 1/2 an inch and maybe close to an inch of hair, depending on the part of my head. I think it's a bit longer than Sandra's, at least on the sides, but I don't know that I could attach a hair clip to it, so maybe not! I am so anxious for it to grow long enough to go without my wig, but it's gonna be a long time yet. Watching it grow is kind of cool though. I've gone from fuzzy chick to street thug to . not sure how to describe now. Maybe elf? It now looks like hair on a head as opposed to a scalp with some hairs, which is nice. My eyebrows and eyelashes thinned but stayed put through all the cycles, then three weeks ago when I was back in DC to do a conference presentation almost all my eyelashes and the end 2/3 of each eyebrow fell out! EEK. I knew this could happen but it was a bit of a shocker when it did. Fortunately they have already grown back pretty fully. but I hear they could come out again. Fun, fun. I was really glad I had kept the eyebrow pencil they gave me in Look Good Feel Better - I hadn't used it until then but for about 10 days I was drawing 'em on. Luckily my wig has long fringy bangs which hides them in part anyway. On the plus side I feel great so the little indignities don't feel so bad. Tamoxifen has been uneventful except my hot flashes have continued, but they're not too bad.

"0d2e3882-68a0-4a11-99cf-74383865b101","Katie - I'm also on dose dense Taxol and also have horrible bone and joint pain in my hips and knees on days 3-5 after chemo. My treatments are on Thursdays, and the first Sunday after my Taxol, I couldn't even get out of bed and the pain brought me to tears. Vicodin did nothing for me. It seems like the only thing that has helped is getting myself up and moving, so I try to walk a few miles on the weekends after my treatment. As soon as I stop moving, the pain hits though. Another bizarre side effect that just started: skin peeling off my heels and feet. Right after my 3rd Taxol, I noticed a large blister-like area on my foot. It wasn't a blister though, just loose, dry skin starting to peel. My entire left heel has peeled and the right one is starting. I freaked out and called the on-call MO over the weekend, and she thought that the AC caused a layer of skin to die in my feet, which is now causing peeling. Anyone else having this? In other news, I got the results of my ""post-chemo"" imaging today. Looks like the tumor and nodes haven't shrunk much at all, and there is an area of calcifications that is concerning.

"0d972c0b-6775-4c5f-b3ec-1225464e7aa9","Hi. You sound like me. I had my first chemo treatment last Thursday, it will be for 16 weeks, every other week now. Then 6-8 weeks of radiation (5 days/week)and then take Tamoxifen after that. What I am just finding out is how fatigued you are afterwards. My chemo was 1 week ago and it is a week later, andI still can hardly get out of bed, except to get some food or go to the bathroom. I left the house only once this week to get some groceries and it wiped me out. I have fibromyalgia, and since chemo started, it has increased what was very manageable for the past 10 years. So, I am sore in the muscles and laying in bed is uncomfortable. Lack of sleep increases the fatigue as you can imagine. I will be so glad when this is over, at least the radiation won't be so severe as this. What are you symptoms, are you handling the chemo OK? Hopefully, it gets better as we get ""used"" to it.","that","after","227","PRP","171","what","fatigu","180","tamoxifen","235","10","VB","and","0","how","VBP","6","VBZ","out","then","WRB","is","drug-SE","take","IN","FALSE","afterward","CC","RB","JJ","you","fatigued","IN","WP","are","Tamoxifen","false","2","DT","NNP","0","false","7","invalid","RB","63","102","25","9","9","1","102","8","44","1","8","44"

I also totally got what you meant by not wanting to see it when it came to your arm LE. Many of my symptoms fit LE, which is why I went ASAP to the LE PT, but since some of my symptoms detour from the typical, I keep secretly hoping maybe it's not. Little by little I'm arriving at acceptance that I probably do have LE that is being exacerbated (or triggered, take your pick) by some other potential probs. Speaking of which, KS1, I wondered about the neuropathy too, since it was after beginning Taxotere that my symptoms began. But my onc says that the peripheral neuropathy from taxanes starts in the fingers (or toes) and works its way up the arms (or legs). and that it is bilateral, never just on one side. But it does have me wondering.

I started the taxol a couple weeks ago and MUCH easier than the AC. Virtually no side effects. I did have a mini setback this week that my counts were too low to get my taxol dose. Kind of a pain since I was already at the hospital and wasted 4 hours. But for you ladies still on the AC, it gets way easier on the taxol. My only significant side effect is that I get really winded when I try to run, so I have switched to a walk/run combo. And my taste buds and appetite are gradually returning. Still down about 5-7 pounds, but better than the 10-11 I was down. I haven't had any sleep or nail issues yet, and have been working pretty much a normal schedule (but I only work 3 days a week anyway).

"0e843656-afe4-4478-92fc-64d8f3842c40","Hi Everyone! I've been off-line for the last week and a half - partly due to the 3rd Tx kicking my butt this time and partly due to getting my baby. er, son off to college. All I could think of during those first 7-8 days after #3 was how I was going to get thru the move last weekend. I was still a little punky, but I did it. Sandra and Terri, I think we had the same kind of reaction this time around. My docs told me that if any one of the tx's would be rough, it would be #3. It was still do-able, but I think the combination of just being sick of this and wanting it to be over, coupled with feeling 'sick' like a cancer patient for the very first time, just made it rougher. I usually came out of the chemo fog by day #3/4, but this time the fog didn't lift until #8. Kathy, congratulations on being finished! WooHoo!!!! Terri, glad you had a great time at the Rod Stewart concert. He's one of my all-time favorites. I seen him a few times. I remember the 1st time during the 70s. I had to sneak out of the house because my mom wouldn't let me go. The Who Concert tragedy was just a week before and my mom was afraid I'd get stomped. How did it go with your son's college move yesterday? Sandra, it looks like our treatments are mirrors of each other. I'm worried about the vein situation too. I had that 'spill' from the Taxotere. That freaked me out. This time, my nausea was so bad I had to go back for another IV of Aloxi. The nurse had to 'butterfly' the needle and said, ""oh yes, your veins are a little spongy."" WTF? She did say it would get better, but they wouldn't be completely healed. That was encouraging. Speaking of chemobrain, while moving my son over the weekend, I went off to the local Target while my husband and son assembled his room. I got lost on the way 3x and I'm usually so good with my sense of direction. By the 3rd attempt I was convinced I totally lost my mind and was about to call my husband to come and find me. Thankfully, the 4th time was a charm and I found my way. Ugh. I keep telling myself that chemobrain is like an urban legend and that it's just a combination of the stress of what we're going thru, the drugs circulating within us and trying to fit that in with the normal day-to-day stress that we deal with. I'm looking forward to #4 (8/29) to go as smoothly as #1. It really is/was do-able it's just that some days I just didn't want to do it or wish I didn't have to do it. LOL @ the tatoo eyes on back of yyour head. I was thinking of doing the pink ribbon back there, then if I was brave enough to walk around bald it send a message to all to get their mammograms.","freak","that","1374","VBD","1329","me","nausea","1337","taxoter","1380","7","DT","spill","0","my","RB","4","NN","this","from","PRP$","time","drug-SE","the","DT","FALSE","bad","NN","JJ","NN","was","nausea","DT","PRP","so","Taxotere","false","3","VBN","NNP","0","false","5","valid","IN","1","25","16","-1","44","44","8","145","44","-1","25","1"

"102fdce7-f82f-4dee-91aa-c4b756534ce4","KLJ, I was also confused since I read many others with my diagnosis whose oncologists recommended tamoxifen. It's not that I wanted to take anything, but wanted to understand whymy oncologistdidn't feel it was warranted for me. Like you, all my cancer was removed in the BMX. Four nodes on each side were taken in the sentinel node biopsy and all were clear. Since I chose mastectomy instead of lumpectomy, I did not have to have radiation (HUGE relief) and of course no chemo was needed. My onco said it was impossible for me to have a recurrence of DCIS or develop IDC, and impossible for me to have LCIS or ILC because those can only grow in ducts and lobules. Since I don't have ducts and lobules anymore, there is 0% chance of recurrence of those. BUT, I could develop one of the other types of breast cancer in the miniscule amount of breast tissue that might still be there after the BMX. The chance is 1% - 2%. She said that tamoxifen can reduce the chance of recurrence significantly in many women, maybe even 50%. However there are side effects that have to be considered, one of which is leukemia. Even though she said it is small (5%) she had two patients with it at the time so that small percentage couldn't be dismissed. I have an aneurysm inthe ascending aorta of my heart and also had a moderate brain stem stroke 16 months ago, so like any drug that is being considered for any of us, the doctor has to weight the pros and cons. The bottom line is that even if tamoxifen reduced my chance of recurrence 50%, that's 50% of 1%-2%, which brings it down to 1/2% to 1%. The small risk of leukemia or another more common but still serious side effect is higher than any benefit it could give me. So no hormone therapy for me.

I cant believe I have gotten through the last 16 weeks, whenmy MO told me 16 weeks of chemo. I thought omg that's so loooonnnggg from now. and hereI am almost donewith chemo. All you ladies are what gotme through some shitty days. I may not post everyday but I read everyday. Jodi -sounds like you are tolerating your first AC much better then I did, I had a terrible time. I am anxious to start acupuncture on my hands and feet to see if it helps with the tingling. Its not bad butits there. My MOtold me I couldn't start til I was 3 weeks out.pisses me off as I know there are cancer centers that have acupuncture right in them, but here they are so freaked out about infection etc, you can hardly move without telling them.

I have been reading all the postsand it has given me great courage to push on thru this. My 4 a/cs were very rough and I was subject to infection easily, so I was basically on house arrest. Fevers and a hospital stay. Then they waited an extra week to start 4/taxol. Boy I felt great for the first one.almost normal.tons of energy and no chemo fog. then after two I started losing all my fingernails. Yuck!!! I have to wear bandaids on all my fingers. I hadnt seen any of you mention this side effect.guess Im just special.thats what the nurse said. Anyway I finally got released from detention and after 5 months of being house bound we went to our cabin.it was coldbut a change of scenery was wonderful. I have my last taxol on the 27th and then on to rads. I will try to keep current with everyone now that I can think straight. Got a couple of questions How soon after the last chemo are you all starting rads? I now have the fuzz on my headis this the color it will be or does the real hair come in a diiferent color? Will I lose the fuzz with the last taxol? TWINK= my feet and hands pealed totally. My doc said to use bag balm and always wear shoes as the new skin underneath is very tender and can be injured easily. Just have to thank you all again for all the tips and encouragement you gave each other. I want you to know it helped me to even thohg I was a silent poster on the board.

"10f73060-de2d-4ae0-9297-ce530c3275e4","thanks for the info, Deb. I'm a bit confused about the paragraph on what estrogen does because my MO told me that the tamoxifen is good for my bones, heart and cholesterol. My grandpa's 98 yr old girlfriend fell down a flight of wooden stairs last year, didn't break a single bone, and her doc said it was because she had been on tamoxifen in the past after having BC. As for the SEs, I have nothing except no periods since I've been on it, and the occasional breast pains, usually around when I should be having a period. I do exercise daily, walk/run at least a mile, then lift weights pretty heavily. I'm building muscle really well, and my husband who has always been a weight lifter said some male body builders take tamoxifen to block any small amount of estrogen they may have and it helps them build muscles bigger and quicker. I don't know how they get ahold of the tamoxifen though. I guess the same way they get illegal steroids. Keep sharing what you've learned. It's greatly appreciated!

I do believe the bones are getting better. I still have the same problems with gastric upsets.

"11336ef6-ef19-4d23-8c2e-c7eb7ef02119","I started Arimidex 4 months ago. Had ACT (4 AC and 12 T) and 33 rads prior. My heart rate increased and saw cardiologist.

I felt awful most of the time and my feet were fried, I still have pain in them - althoughit is getting better. The Ixempra also did nothing for my cancer. I was switched to Doxil and had 6 treatments. 4 last spring every three weeks, a break for a mastectomy and 2 more this fall. My hair grew in while I was on doxil and besides a few days of fatigue after each treatment I thought it was pretty mild compared to Ixempra. After being on chemo since last Jan. the last dose of doxil wiped me out physically. My skin did get very fragile and thin, especially on my feet and hands. One of my feet is still peeling. I also got good results from doxil. My last scans showed no progression on lymph node mets and that the bone in my spine is healing over where my bone mets used to be.

(did ice my fingers more than my toes to be honest ) but still lost them all now. they are half way so half on half off. getting use to it. put some sally hansen hardner on the actual nail bit thats still there and they are growing a little more now. it doesn't take long but they still look yuk! Started falling off around the 5 week mark for me I think it was. been 8 weeks yesterday that I finishedTaxotere. Websister . :) Just noted your post about walking and lower back aches. omg. I'm soooo with you. I was sooo worried it was just me! My thighs and torso are sore at times too. I know I'm probably over doing it and still on the other chemo regime now but I still need to walk and lift my DS up !! hope yours eases soon. Ladies I'm so with you all on your 'well you look good ' comments. My husband tends to think the whole time that because I'm no different ( physically etc not when I'm at home with my little scarf thing on)!! friends seem to think because I still go out etc that I'm 'normal' nothing wrong, but thats because WE just don't whinge and make a fuss of the little aches and pains that our body is giving us. sometimes I wish i could just 'slap' them and say ' hey I feel like crap on the inside, look at what chemos done to my outside, hell yeh I'm just fine and dandy what do you think!!!

"1237aa9f-83cb-4f4c-889a-3cde6c086ca1","What a wealth of information this website continues to be for me. There is so much the doctors don't tell us before we start drugs like Arimidex. I guess they're afraid we'll have symptoms of all the side effects! I've been on Armidex for 2 years, but the feeling that I was on the verge of a UTI actually started soon after starting chemo (Taxotere, Carboplatinum, and Herceptin). It never got bad enough for me to think I had a fullblown infection until just recently. I think I had 2 UTIs within a month of each other. Was treated with antibiotics both times, but 2nd time it didn't work very well, so I started to think maybe it wasn't really an infection. The doctor put me on a Rx that calms smooth muscles and that seemed to help quite a bit, but not 100%. I've committed to using Replens every other day and after just one week, there is some more improvement. All my doctors would OK the estring, but it scares me - no clinical trials to show it's safe for bc survivors. Although if the Repens doesn't work in the long-term, I would consider it. Haven't had intercourse with my husband in over a year. Luckily there are other alternatives.

"126cebc9-197d-4e30-83e5-8fb701d9e4a1","OK winter radiants - I'm moving ahead finally. Appointment w/the RO last Thursday. She listened to an hour of my questions. Mapping & simulation last Friday. My right side is covered w/red/green/blue/black ink. And the plan is clear tape where the lines meet. Because I'm sensitive to tape, I told them to go ahead & do the pin-point tattoos where it was critical since I probably couldn't keep the tape on or they'd be redoing the simulation before we were through. So I have 9 tattoos even tho this MD Anderson center doesn't usually tattoo for breast cancer anymore. I had a BMX in Feb. 2011 that got clear margins, clean SNB and exhibited only DCIS, so I went ahead w/reconstruction and no further treatment. Had a chest wall recurrence in March 2013 - now IDC, Grade 3, HER2+, that didn't totally respond to chemo, so after ALND surgery when the BS discovered one positive node, I did more rounds of different chemo. January has been a rest & test month trying to build my body & blood back somewhat. Team Kim's questions were great. Given that every doc is different - here are some of her answers. I will have external beam rads to the right reconstructed breast and the ""draining lymph nodes."" Radiation will go to midline. I will be on a totally flat table to minimize damage to the lung. They expect it to damage some of my R lung, but not my heart. They do utilize 'breath hold'. The risk of a second primary tumor at the site of recurrence is very small, which of course doesn't say anything about mets to other places. I may have a lump in my throat & trouble swallowing as rads hit the esophagus. There is a 2% chance of bracheoplexus problems. There is a 2% chance of rib fracture for the rest of my life. RO & I agreed on 50 grays for 5 weeks - no boosts, concentrating on the chest wall & the lymph nodes since I have no breasts & the recurrence was not behind the implants. She said 60 gry was optimal for my situation but understands that I'm very concerned about: a) capsular contracture of the implant that's been in there since Sept 2011; b) lymphadema since the surgery already took all the level one lymph nodes and she will be radiating all the level 2 & level 3 nodes; c) neuropathy since I still have some very serious problems 6 months after the taxotere chemo. There will probably be fibrosis & scaring & the tissue will be tighter, so she does expect the R implant to at least be ""pulled upward"" by that & may be disfigured. She has personally never seen an implant that ""extruded"". I have 11 exercises that I'm supposed to do 3 times every day - 5 to 10 reps - to keep stretching the tissues. That said, there is a 25% chance of recurrence in the same area if I don't do radiation vs. only 5-10% if I do it, so. I'll start Thursday 2/13. I was a former long time smoker so I had a low-dose spiral CT done today to get a baseline of any prior damage to the lungs, since rads will damage at least a quadrant of the R lung. Also ended up getting a PFT - pulmonary breathing test - to determine the volume of my lungs pre-rads. She recommended pure Aloe &/or Aquafor to start. Because of my skin, she also said Miaderm would be good. I will get Silvadene if my skin gets really bad. She recommended using 3-4 times a day but not more than 4 hours before treatment. She did not agree with my derm doc to use Elocon once a day as a prophylactic for radiation dermatitis - so we'll hold off on that. She approved my re-starting Omega 3/fish oil but NOT Vit E, or any other high dose antioxidants (Vit A, C. ). She approved the 5000 mcl of Biotin in addition to my regular supplements - Centram Silver, Calcium, Vit D, Vit B6, Vit B12, Acetyl L-carnatine. Her most ardent recommendation was DRINK and don't get dehydrated. Of course that's a problem for me, but I'll keep trying. Of course the consent I had to sign has LOTS of scary side effects that it says may be worsened by chemo or surgery before, during or after rads. Hmmm - got it all going for me. The best part was - after the simulation & mapping she came and stood by my head while I was still in the 'mold' and asked if I had any other questions. I laughed and said ""wasn't an hour's worth enough yesterday?"" My RO is definitely not just a physicist. She's a doc w/a great bedside manor & lots of patience. And wants me to email her personally if I have any other questions or concerns. Sorry for the length but wanted to share all the info I received. I promise to be more quiet going forward unless I need to whine. Peaches - I had Herceptin April thru September 2013, stopped for surgery & then had to stop because the 2nd chemo (Adriamycin) is also very toxic to the heart. Just started herceptin again 2/5/14. I also had to put everything off for a week in the first round due to low blood counts. I've never heard that the days are that critical but I will be asking.","i","again","4772","NULL","4678","also","low","4687","herceptin","4788","17","VBD","NULL","0","to","NULL","67","JJ","round","just","TO","due","drug-SE","start","NN","FALSE","NULL","NULL","NULL","JJ","NULL","low blood counts","RB","RB","NULL","herceptin","false","2","PRP","NN","0","false","68","valid","RB","102","44","80","80","80","80","44","44","47","102","131","8"

But since being diagnosed with a met on my femur (at the hip) the MO has asked me to try Anastrozole (Arimidex). With Tamoxifen I had lots of side effects but somehow I found them manageable. Since the switch (now into my 2nd month) I've had terrible hot flashes (been meno since chemo 2009), bone pain (both hips), migraines and the worst one - HAIR LOSS! It's funny (strange not haha) to me to read on here about everyone else's side effects and how different we all are. On Tamoxifen I had headaches (but not as bad as now), blurred vision, hearing loss, excess fluid (sinuses & ears), hands, feet and leg pain. Sounds like a lot but they came on slowly and came and went during the 3 years I was on it. I took breaks too - before surgeries - and it was nice to feel a bit ""normal"" again. When I started up again the side effects resumed but they were bearable. After just a few weeks on Anastrozole I started feeling the bone pain, headaches and hot flashes. The hair loss (pisses me right off) just started in the 2nd month and I've been checking for bald patches (none so far) but it's certainly not like chemo hair loss. Maybe this will just be an adjustment time for me and then it will level off like the Tamoxifen did? I sure hope so!

When I started up again the side effects resumed but they were bearable. After just a few weeks on Anastrozole I started feeling the bone pain, headaches and hot flashes. The hair loss (pisses me right off) just started in the 2nd month and I've been checking for bald patches (none so far) but it's certainly not like chemo hair loss. Maybe this will just be an adjustment time for me and then it will level off like the Tamoxifen did? I sure hope so!

No depression, mild hot flashes, no change in sex drive. At 7 weeks, I developed hives on my arms and legs. Within 24 hours, my ankles and feet became swollen to the point walking became difficult. I stopped taking Tamoxifen and after 3 days of nurses and then a doctor telling me it was not due to the treatment, I met with a PA in oncology. She gave me an emergency dose and then a course of progesterone to counter the reaction. All these medical folks said they had never seen such a reaction. Today, the oncologist said given the hives did not subside for 10 days after the progesterone, it was definitely a Tamoxifen reaction. Put on Exemestane ($9.16/dose) today with joint pain, osteoporosis, hot flashes, dizziness as a few of the common side effects.

"13bfef56-eced-4aa6-86b3-43da67b9f9a4","Margaret, CMF chemo has a few different regimens. I did the ""classic"" CMF regimen, which was 14 days of cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) pills and intravenous methotrexate and 5-fluororuacil (5-FU) given on day 1 and day 8 of each 28 day cycle. I had 12 infusions over a course of 6 months, I lost about 50-60% of my hair. I never needed a wig but my hair did look thinned out. I used Nioxin hair products to make my hair look fuller. With your friend doing the Cytoxan in pill form it's really important that she drinks a lot of water. Also taking the anti-nausea meds can cause constipation so what I did was start taking stool softeners 2-3 days before my infusions and continue a few days post infusion. If I needed to continue my anti nausea meds for more than a few days post infusion I continued taking the stool softener too. If your friend needs more anti-nausea meds tell her to ask for more, I was given a script for 30 pills with 2 refills and directions on the label 'use as needed'. Nausea wasn't a big problem for me, I never had to get a refill on my meds but it was nice to know they were available if I needed them. Fatigue hit me about the halfway through treatment, that & the constant battle to keep constipation at bay were my biggest problems while doing CMF. Best wishes to your friend.","pill","in","574","RB","456","form","constip","463","cytoxan","586","21","DT","friend","0","caus","WP","7","MD","med","do","VB","can","drug-SE","the","NNS","FALSE","i","NN","PRP","NN","so","constipation","IN","NN","what","Cytoxan","false","2","NN","NNP","0","false","8","invalid","VBG","1","44","13","44","44","44","25","127","47","127","8","131"
"13c999a2-09e8-415e-9185-5fed1ee029d9","hello everyone, just been catching up on all the posts, I've been up visiting family, which was lovely, but very tiring. The biggest side effect of the Taxol for me is the fatigue - got in the pool and just could not swim more than 200 meters, and that really did me in. So very gentle yoga is the order of the day for me at the moment. I have the next chemo tomorrow, it was so good to have a week off with no chemo! 2 more sessions and then it's game reserve time. Hope I'm not going to struggle, tho I won't be flying alone, which I found just exhausting. My sister from California will be arriving here on Monday and she'll fly up with me, then I'll fly home again with my son. Can't tell you how excited I am to be seeing him soon. Adagio they gave me aqueous cream pre-mixed with cortisone cream, which is all I used during radiation. I did shower in just warm water, but didn't use soap, and patted dry very carefully. I didn't burn until towards the end, but not badly. At the end of rads they told me to continue using the aqueous/cortisone mix for 2 weeks, then I could use other creams. I used a Kigelia gel, (which I'm not sure is made anywhere but here in South Africa) - it's absolutely brilliant - check it out on www.theoliveworkshop.co.za I tried aloe vera gel (99% aloe vera) but found it a bit drying. My skin went back to normal pretty quickly. Good luck with the rads - after chemo it's so much easier! My hair has started to fall out and I'm not happy about that! I knew it would happen, but I so don't want to be bald again. I know I have bigger things to worry about - what's hair? It'll grow back, but I have so loved my new curly, thick hair (it was also very straight and fine). It's kinda like no one sees the sores in your mouth or the headaches or the nausea or the fatigue, but your hair is so right out there. Dammit!! I was looking at pics of when I was bald and I look just like my 91 year old Dad. With this new hair I look like my Mom. I much prefer looking like my Mom!!! Oh well, I'll get over it. Been a bit down because of the fatigue mainly, I always get tearful when I'm over tired, also not able to put any weight on, even tho I'm eating more than I normally do and do 2 Ensure shakes a day on top of meals. Michael, I'm also getting the steriod high - not much sleep for the first 2 days, and a total motor mouth, like you said. I just buzz and get very busy, but if I make myself lay down and have a rest in the afternoons that does help to kind of break the mania. I'm still learning how to handle it. Liv, have everything crossed that your scans and everything will be ok. Hang in there, I know every new test and check up is nerve wracking, thinking of you!

I started charting intake 3 days before treatment. during and at least a few days after. then if I couldn't get 100 oz I made sure to drink at least 64 oz but tried for more!! Very important! Also taking Claritin if you get neulesta shot day after infusion. helps with bone pain. I even took 1 1/2 tabs of Claritin for a week after and 2 days before shot. call mo with any side effects! They start you with dosing but as you go in doses may be changed depending on tolerance. at 3 rd infusion I had rash so he cut taxotere back. then also lowered it for neuropathy issues. chemo is doable if you take care of yourself and pay attention. it becomes your job!!

My white blood counts came back too low when they tested one week after the initial IV so they took me off the oral Zeloda right before my Hawaii trip. At least I was able to enjoy my trip more than I would have otherwise. Lost my hair while in Hawaii. Came out in huge clumps. The day before we came home I found a hairdresser to cut my hair really short, then got it buzzed when I got home. The doctor isn't being so nice this time around with treatment. Had my second chemo this past Wednesday. I'm not to even come around for a blood test because if the blood counts show low again, they'll have to take me off the oral and they don't want to. So. they said call if I get sick and come back in 3 weeks for treatment #3. I'm hanging in there. Really tired, heartburn, no appetite (metallic taste in my mouth), sore mouth, well, you all know.

I had the same type of response as you on Round 1 - days 4-7 were to worst in terms of fatigue and just blah, but generally I felt okay, and then I started to improve to feel almost really normal before going in again. So, I was also anticipating round 2 and wondering how I would fare. For me, that tx #2 was last Wednesday, and it was generally the same drill, but I do have to say the fatigue has stuck with me a bit longer. I also have some nausea this time around, which really I didn't have at all on round 1. So, I guess yeah, it's a bit worse this time than the first, but I'm still working full time, dancing, doing my taxes, and trying to just ignore it all as best I can. You'll be fine, but I totally understand the anticipation.

Secondly, I will very much respect the purpose of your forum, and won't post here again without invitation. Finally, I am first author on the study that was discussed in the news segment. I have scanned through all of your comments and questions, and I have a few answers and comments myself.1) Bazedoxifene (BZA for simplicity) is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) just like tamoxifen is. However, a next generation SERM that removes the uterine stimulatory effect of this drug class. Think of it as a WAY better raloxifene. Better in that it is a) more potent, b) does NOT cause hot flash, c) far more effective antagonist of estrogen receptor in the breast. Thus, while raloxifene is effective as a breast cancer preventative only, BZA has the potential to target ER action in breast cancer. Capriness above, be sure that your Dr understands that raloxifene won't cut ice here and it needs to be BZA.2) BZA works similarly to Faslodex, but is much more patient friendly (oral), and we expect it will be more effective, because it is much more readily taken up by the body. I have to emphasize that we have great data in animal studies using predictive models, but BZA has yet to be evaluated FOR BREAST CANCER TREATMENT in humans. However, in the studies that tested BZA for use in osteoporosis treatment, the Drs did observe decreased incidence (again, like raloxifene). If you want to go down this road, please understand that distinction - that is the one that will give your Dr pause about prescribing it.3) BZA is approved for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis in Europe. For reasons I won't go into here, Pfizer currently has no plans to either evaluate this drug in breast cancer treatment or to license it as an osteoporosis treatment in the USA. That being said, if there is medical justification, the drug might be obtained from Pfizer through compassionate use. You can address that with your Dr. Again, keep the faith, and while it may not seem like it, we are working hard every day.

I also had the sinus thing with the Cytoxan but they said they would slow it down from 20 to 30 minutes next Tx to resolve the sinus irritation. It only lasted a few minutes so it wasn't really that bad. Lots of small meals seems to keep the nausea away. Sleeping better now that the steroids are done. Today just feeling like I want to lay around and rest a bit. Tomorrow, I'll be taking my Neupogen shot on my own and so far no SEs from it but may be too early to say for sure. It's so good to know from reading here that everything that's happening to me is pretty normal even though there are variations with all of us.

"16d86671-a823-4cb9-921c-73035119dea9","Hello all. Thought I would stop in to say hello and let you all know I'm thinking about you and praying for your. Lucy, so glad to hear fromyou. Sorry to hear about the nail situation! I thought those B vitamins were doing the trick. I'm trying the Emu oil on the toe nails and hoping it will be enough. I had another infusion on Friday and the nurse told me it was the Taxol that's wreaking havoc on my neuropathy in my good hand. I'm now looking for something that will keep it from getting any worse. Today I had another thorocentesis (lung drain). It was a rough one as the doctor kept hitting a rib and couldn't get the drain tub in so she kept fishing around. I'm pretty sore tonight and praying I won't be so sore tomorrow as I have to work. Also praying my insurance changes it's mind on the blood thinner pills as they've denied them so far. I'm out of places on my stomach to give myself a shot and am starting to have pain with each shot (along with a lot of bleeding). I guess I'm just getting a little weary of it all. But, seeing what everyone else is having to deal with I guess I shouldn't be venting! Have a wonderful Easter week all. We had quite a bit of snow yesterday but it's supposed to warm up through the rest of the week. Finally some spring! Blessings to all.

"17120c58-309c-4986-82cc-3464e392a979","Hi everyone, I'm finally joining in the posting. This is my first and so it is long. I was diagnosed in August 09 with IDC - a small but mighty tumor: PR+ ER+ Her2/Neu+ Grade 3. With that my Stage 1 (neg on the one node removed) ""oh just surgery plus rads will be enough"" changed to ""the works."" At this moment treatment looks like chemo first (18-24 wks), then rads (7wks), then hormone therapy (5 years). Chemo for me is TCH: taxotere, carboplatin and herceptin. All 3 are given every 3 weeks and the herceptin is given every week. So a cycle includes one full TCH treatment plus two H-only treatments. I'm to have 6 cycles. Except it is under reconsideration. Cycle 1 Day 1 was Nov 5. Getting the TCH was tiring but OK. Like many of you the anticipation was worse. Day 2 and 3 introduced mild nausea, heartburn/reflux, diarrhea, fatigue. Day 4 swept me off my feet. I stayed in bed hoping that if I didn't move. it didn't work. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cotton-mouth, metallic taste. Zophran and composine were wonderful. Then I started adjusting and feeling better. Days 5-6-7 each had 3-4 pretty good hours before the long naps drew me in. Diarrhea remained stubborn and scouring. Day 8 was the first H-only treatment. That night I felt like a steepchase with a dozen horses raced through my bloodstream. In the morning I felt trampled. By afternoon I started having fevers and as they got higher we followed instructions and called the onc. Day 10 my onc sent me to the ER with an overnight bag. I stayed in the hospital 3 nights/4 days and came home yesterday. I had neutopenic fevers. My white blood cell count was too low and the neutrphils even more so. Normal counts for neutrophils are 1800-8300, the danger zone is at 500 and mine had dropped to 36. When my count went back up to 600 it was good enough to send me home. Even though I am on powerful antibiotics, I feel better than since Day 1. Tomorrow, Nov 19, is my second H-only treatment. The onc thinks this is all related to TCH and not to the H and I WANT to believe him. but in my mind the fevers followed the H, so. I have a bit of trepedation. Tomorrow will be the test. I meet with the onc next week to see what changes in my treatment he'll recommend. I expect the TC dosage might be lowered (and more cycles added) and I may have to take neupogen to stimulate the WBC. I also have been having acupuncture and working with a naturopath to build my immune system. I can't take some of the supplements (L-glutamine, CoQu10, L-carnitine) while on this particular antibiotic but am hoping I can get them going before the next cycle. It has been a full 14 days. I seem to have gone through the book and tried out a good share of the side effects listed! Anyone else have trouble with WBC, or take neupogen? Thanks for sharing all your posts - it really is wonderful to have this community to turn to. Today was a good leaf-kicking day!

"17120c58-309c-4986-82cc-3464e392a979","Hi everyone, I'm finally joining in the posting. This is my first and so it is long. I was diagnosed in August 09 with IDC - a small but mighty tumor: PR+ ER+ Her2/Neu+ Grade 3. With that my Stage 1 (neg on the one node removed) ""oh just surgery plus rads will be enough"" changed to ""the works."" At this moment treatment looks like chemo first (18-24 wks), then rads (7wks), then hormone therapy (5 years). Chemo for me is TCH: taxotere, carboplatin and herceptin. All 3 are given every 3 weeks and the herceptin is given every week. So a cycle includes one full TCH treatment plus two H-only treatments. I'm to have 6 cycles. Except it is under reconsideration. Cycle 1 Day 1 was Nov 5. Getting the TCH was tiring but OK. Like many of you the anticipation was worse. Day 2 and 3 introduced mild nausea, heartburn/reflux, diarrhea, fatigue.

"1775838b-db79-47cf-8dc6-12e2119d8d61","Hi Nicki, The movie was cute. Not as good as Shrek but it was cute. The animation was great and the music was fun. Your son will love it. It was wonderful not to have chemo on Friday. Even better not to have to start the steroids on Thursday or plan more weekly blood draws. Like you I did not enjoy the chemo staff and am happy to be done with them. Nails are still hanging in there. A bruise looking area has appeared on one finger nail but for the most part the tenderness is all gone. Gonna keep em short and hope for the best. But heck after losing my hair losing a nail or two is just icing on the cake ! I have been going wigless for about the last month and a half. I usually wear a baseball cap or scarf and sometimes I go without anything! It has just gotten to warm to be wearing a wig out. I have been out in the garden doing little things and I have noticed my scalp getting a bit of a tan. It really makes the white/grey hairs stand out. Great. Kathy-The pains I get are mostly at night also. It seems to be lower extremities only. I have used more vicodin in the last three weeks than I did during all 12 weeks of taxotere! Thank goodness it was only 4 treatments!! Julie-Thanks for the update on the taxotere pain. It is nice to know there is an end to this! Paula-Glad your surgery is behind you. Good news about the nodes hope you get equally good news about the margins. I don't recal what your her2 status is. If it was positive will you be getting Herceptin or are you a tamoxifen girl? I am look forward to getting the surgery over with in the next couple of weeks. It is kind of hard to remember but I think I am almost as freaked out about surgery as I was about chemo. maybe even more!

It would be really nice to deal with JUST cancer, wouldn't it? Marcia: Hope school is still going well! So you do radiation M-F? How long does it take each time? I am so curious about radiation. I have no idea if I am getting it or not. Stephanie: Your bone pain sounds terrible. I am on another forum where women are complaining of the bone pain as well, so you are not alone. I get a little bone pain. hips, arms, and face. but it is not severe. My taxol has been weekly though (x12). There is nothing worse than being in pain and not being able to do anything about it. Make sure you are pushing your water to get that nasty Taxol out of your system as fast as possible. Pam: Are your boys back to school yet? How are you feeling? Steve & Billiemae: Oh no. more tumors? Geez! I also had my hormones tested right before my diagnosis b/c my periods had suddenly got really irregular. Anyway, I have elevated estrogen too. Not terribly high, but an imbalance. And my cancer is ER+. When I spoke to the GYN about that, he didn't say he thinks it's related, but I am not so sure. Will Billiemae be on hormone suppression therapy? So my last Taxol is tomorrow! YAY!!! I had a rougher week this week with side effects. Each week has gotten a little tougher. I am getting a week off before starting AC. I am thrilled for that week off! So last night we went to a birthday party for a little girl down the street. The adults hung out while the kids ran around and played. It was really nice. Then at 4am I woke up from a noise outside. I could see around the shade those flashing red and blue lights. I looked outside and there were police cruisers in front of my house, and every fire truck in the city was on the street. I woke up Greg and we both went outside. The house next door to the birthday party was ON FIRE! Thankfully no one lives there. it was foreclosed and the city took it over and just finished rennovating it and put it on the market. But our friends had parked both of their cars in that driveway to have them out of the way for the party. Both of their cars are burned down to the steel frames. No idea if any houses next to it were damaged. But the fire spread through the house SO QUICKLY. Very scary. I can see how people can get trapped in their homes and not get out in time. So thankful that no one was hurt. Also, this week I took the kids to a restaurant for dinner. There was a lady there who is a survivor and she stopped to talk with us. Later after we were eating, the waittress came over to tell me that the lady had payed our bill! WOW. I have met some wonderful people during this process. I cannot wait to pay it forward for someone when I can say I am 7-years cancer free!","been","has","664","CC","591","week","pain","596","taxol","668","12","PRP$","NULL","0","in","RB","9","VBG","than","NULL","IN","be","drug-SE","my","IN","FALSE","be","NULL","VBG","NN","and","pain","VBZ","JJ","not","taxol","false","2","VBN","NN","0","false","10","valid","NULL","1","80","80","25","44","8","-1","25","102","8","8","25"

So I gave up and went to bed. I had Chemo a/c #3 on Dec 15. I also feel sick just from the the thought of the chemo, not the medicine itself. It seems the more chemo I take, the worse I feel. I am not bouncing back as fast. My stomach has major indigestion and I have major constipation. I am doing everything the oncs and nurses say to do. One more A/C - YEAH. then 4 T's. My nurse says T is not as bad as A/C and I should start to feel a little better. Is that true??? Also, water tastes so bad. Anyone have any suggestions? I have tried lemon water, really cold water, warm water, ice chips etc. I just could use a few new ideas. I am going to the genetic couns for the BRAC I and II in Jan and also am seeing a Gyno Onc for my left ovary in Jan. Glad to see everyone is hanging in there.

"17fc3001-cf01-4a60-a9fc-d6d7c31069e4","Kt57 - My sister-in-law has a house on Swan Lake in Hibbing, MN. It is truly a beautiful place, relaxing as not much to do. Watching sunrise and set over the lake is one of my favoirite things to do when we are there. Ever been to Swan Lake?yearofthehat -thinking of you as even though it is early early a.m. on friday you will be off for your LAST CHEMO treatment soon. WHOPPPIE! Went in for #5 today. 4 more to go. As you can see by the time, the steroids are doing their job keeping me up at this weird hour. I actually came home from treatment and slept off the benedryl from 6 p.m. to about 12:30 a.m. so now I am wide awake. Hopefully it won't last long but at least I do not have to be in school until noon tomorrow so can sleep in if necessary. Of course, I am sitting her munching out on my steroid high which I really do not need to be doing. Getting on the scale before treatment has become almost as dreaded as the treatment itself. Up another pound this week. UGH! Treatment went well. Had a good nurse today. I like it when they can get the IV in the first try. Also saw my Dr. before treatment today so that was nice. As JillyG empowered me to ask about a pain I have been having in the left breast sort of behind the breast really that has been bothering me for a month or so and he did an examine and said it is nothing. Pain bone in chest wall from Tx most likely culprit so hopefully I'll put that fear to rest now. Speaking of bone pain I also asked him about that and he prescribed ULTRAM 50 mg. Said it is not a narcotic but works better than tylenol for most people so I will get that filled tomorrow and let you know how it works. My WCB count was only 3.2 BEFORE treatment so that worries me. Hey Ladies who have done the weekly taxol route is this what you found to be true? Don't like starting with such low counts since I ended up neutropenic so many times. Dr. did not seem worried. June is going to be a month of up and downs for sure as it is my 6 month anniversary of Dx so surgeron has order MRI for June 4th. Followup with her June 8th. then last treatment on June 18th. Oncologists today ordered Mammogram as he said he is not sure why surgeron wanted MRI done but he thought doing both could not hurt. Both of those tests now scare the heck out of me as I am sure you all can relate to. Have to call tomorrow to set up Mammo. Onco dr. also wants me to get chest xray to make sure the double pnemonia is completely resolved, which I think it is. I do still get winded easily and feel some pain in the back where my left lung is located but I am assuming these are tx related and not from pnemonia. Will be glad to have xray to verify that. My husband starts his new job (he is retiring aftre 30 years in the Navy) on June 1st. He has been to every chemo and doctor appointment with me so I am kind of nervous about going it alone which I'll have to do now that he will be returning to a 9 to 5 commuting job. He has been teaching at the Naval Academy and his class schedule has been such that he could come with me. Only three more after June 1st. I can do this. My sister is flying in from New Hampshire to go to my June 4th tx with me so that's cool. I could probably find a friend to go last two if I need to. The benedryl could make driving home a little hairy as I get really drousy from it. Well will worry about that come June I guess. So as I am sure you have all had your fill of my sterioid ramblings I will say good night or good morning or whatever it is and find something else to occupy the mind while I wait for sleep to come. Thanks again for being here. Love you all.

"18e104d1-71a7-493c-aa63-2ff2bd728690","I had DD (weekly) Taxol in 2010. I didn't take any supplements to avoid neuropathy (in hindsight, maybe I should have). About 3/4 of the way through Taxol my oncologist cut my dose down a bit and we actually ended up canceling my last treatment due to the problems I was having with neuropathy. I was having horrendous pain in my feet. Mostly at night. it felt like they were on fire. My hands had some tingling and numbness and I became more clumsy. Two years later, and I would say the neuropathy is 98% gone. I still have some very minor numbness in my finger tips and very mild burning pain in my feet for a couple minutes after I get out of bed in the morning. I guess it sounds like supplements are a good idea. The important thing is to be very honest with your feedback about neuropathy to your oncologist. Don't try and tough it out, because I was told if enough damage is done, a person could be in pain for the rest of their lives. I agreed to the cut in dose and nixing the last dose because I didn't figure pain for the rest of my life was worth it. Other then the neuropathy, Taxol was a breeze for me compared to AC.

Decadron also helps with nausea, you probably got way more than I did. (6 mg). So let's just assume you will be just fine. If not, you know who to call! The more you drink, the sooner the red devil leaves your system. I am usually finished with red pee by the time I get home from chemo. Drink girl, drink!!! I guess I won't anticipate any miraculous hair growth while on Taxol. The PA told me they don't even give much in the way of anti-nausea meds because you ""don't get nausea"" with Taxol. So I want to hear from all of you who are doing it first. I seem to remember that there was some nausea reported. Not looking for trouble, but I want to be armed with info in case that's not exactly right! Took my mom to the beach today, it was very lovely. And I ate steamers to bump up my iron. This morning I had eggs, sausage and cantaloupe to help out my white cells. I don't want another delay!

Seems like there were a few minor SEs in the beginning (mostly hot flashes and a little joint pain) but really leveled off after a month or so. I would give it more than a week because what SEs you have in the beginning may be less noticeable as time goes on. Aromasin has been much more difficult for me. I feel better being off it for a week . still have strange tingling feeling in my back, hot flashes but energy level is much better already. Hopefully these other strange effects will go away and I can try something else. I wouldn't mind going back to tamox.","over","for","105","CC","15","a","hot","24","tamoxifen","116","16","VBD","suze","0","most","DT","1","NN","the","i","RB","begin","drug-SE","took","DT","FALSE","littl","NNP","RB","JJ","and","hot flashes","IN","DT","a","tamoxifen","false","2","IN","NN","0","false","3","valid","PRP","63","44","61","25","25","1","9","1","25","1","123","8"

I have completed my 4 taxol (every other week) with a neulasta shot 24 hours after each. Usually the achey pain last about 2 1/2 days, but this is my 4th morning where I almost feel like I have a sciatic nerve thing happening. Also, a strange dry rash has broken out on my left thigh!! I'm using Eucerin cream, but it's still there. I can only stand vicodin for the first day and 1/2, so I'm feeling miserable. Fingernails are discoloring, too. I'll look for future responses. Thanks.

"1ae9863c-faec-4923-84b7-c7a63d9dca31","Marsha -- You poor baby, I can't believe the nerve of that surgeon. If it's any consolation to you, I also have LCIS in my other breast. Initially, I opted for a lumpectomy because of the location of the tumor, it's relatively small size, the chance of a good cosmetic outcome, and my inability to cope with thinking about reconstruction at that time. After the lumpectomy, an MRI-guided biopsy on my other breast found a benign lump, with a tiny, tiny focus of LCIS. There's not a day that goes by that I don't think about having a double mastectomy and reconstruction. However, my med onc, whom I trust, does not think that it is medically necessary. He prefers careful surveillance. I haven't had my six month post-surgery checkup with my surgeon, but I will certainly question her for her opinion. Twink and Carynn -- great stories! Vegas -- Congrats on the engagement. Your hair will be wonderful by the time of the wedding! Twink -- I also have joint issues. My hands hurt when I wake up in the morning and my hip joints hurt when I get up after sitting more than 20 minutes. I definitely attribute it to after effects from taxol. I've been working out on a treadmill about four days a week, and I see no improvement in the pain. Carynn, Twink, and Karen -- I, too, have that peach fuzz. I've tweezed a lot of it, but I'll probably end up waxing as well. Today we're going to my dh's doctor to find out what he recommends about the thyroid issue. Even though the lumps are benign, I would not be surprised if he recommends surgery to remove them. Thanks for everyone's good wishes .

It is tough going from your dx and now your husband. That is a lot within a year and for anyone to bear. What a tough year for the both of you but we are hear to take whatever load we can from you by being hear to listen, encouraging and at times we hope to provide a little amusement! Keep us updated. Gatomal, I hope you feel better today. Reading your post I said ""ouch"". Cassiecat, how is your daughter doing with her ballet? Any programs coming up? Bippy, so glad you are settling in nicely at your new job! I switched jobs about 7 months before my dx. I love it, the people, my manager and especially the pace! No monthly travel, work days are reasonable, no weekend work and I manage a much smaller team! Been on Tamoxifen for 1 week and no major SEs, I have to say 1 silver lining is that I don't have as many night sweats? MO did another ovary functioning test and % dropped drastically and she will monitor over the next few months to ensure it continues to trend downwards. If not we will then discuss OS. My biggest issue 4 weeks post radiation is fatigue -- can I say fatigue again . I posted on the winter RADs board but wanted to share here. I am still soooo tired. My MO, RO and PCP didn't have much feedback except exercise, eat right, drink lots of fluid and take it easy. I guess I am just impatient and need to learn that it took 9 months to get hear and will not go away in a few weeks/months. I do exercise daily and I am exhausted afterwards. I get a good mid-day nap in on most days. I have learned to not shy away from sleeping aids . Anyone else still having ""lingering"" fatigue. I have to say it is improving but i just didn't expect to still be this tired. As my mother would say ""patience Angie, patience -- you are always trying to hurry things"" -- big smile.

I have learned a lot from many of you as I've gone through diagnosis and treatment (Stage IIA, IDC, 1 node positive, ER+, PR+, Her-2/Neu not overexpressed, chemo: TC, 6 1/2 weeks of radiation including boost to tumor bed). I've been taking tamoxifen since July of this year. July, August, and September were fine except for the hot flashes--I've learned to take my tamoxifen at night because it seems to reduce the number of hot flashes I have during the day. better to flash and go back to sleep than flash and grouse about it for an hour. lol. Anyway, in October, I had an allergic reaction that landed me in the emergency room. hives, swelling, etc. that the ER doctor attributed to food. I hadn't had any new foods that day and I've eaten all of the same things many or several times since then. November, I had another nasty reaction that was worse than the first and included swelling of my airways and difficulty breathing and nearly passing out. (Different foods this time). Yesterday I had another reaction on the road on the way home from a family vacation. This time hives, weakness, swelling, and a terrble nasty abdominal cramp that felt for all the world like a contraction that lasted for about half an hour. I even felt it in my back. Benadryl and Pepsid stopped the reaction. My husband thinks that these allergic reactions are related to the beginning of my menstrual cycle for two of these, November and December. October is a bit of a wild card since I didn't get my period back until November. The reactions are approximately a month apart, so I am willing to believe my husband's theory as I try to work this out. Have any of you had, or know of anyone who's had, intermittent or cyclic allergic reactions (to tamoxifen???) like this? My doctor seems baffled and a little less concerned about this than I am.

"1b64032c-3f4c-42a0-95fb-45612d0fe400","Hi Lisa:Ohmy,you're right --I didn't mention anything about nail problems. Yes, generally the taxotere does affect one's nails -- fingers and toes. The nail beds may become quite tender (a bit of an anomaly since the fingertips can become quite numb!!). You may develop horizontal ridges starting at the base of the nail and these ridges (sometimes one for each treatment) will be lighter in colour. The nails might (and I emphasize might) lift -- basically to make room for a new nail growing underneath. You might find that your nails develop dark streaks and/or discolour somewhat. I've developed the ridges on the fingers of my left hand and thumbs, and I might be losing my left thumb nail (a real nuisance as I'm left-handed and use that thumb alot!). So I'm keeping a bandaid on it until it decides what it's going to do! Otherwise, I use cuticle cream and a lot of hand lotion to keep the cuticles soft. Have also kept polish on my nails throughout chemo and after. Apparentlytaxotere responds ""unfavourably' to sunlight. Both thumbnails are still tender but the other nails aren't now, so I'm hoping they will be okay. It's also critical to keep the nails as squeaky clean as possible, because a fungal-type infection could start if the nailbeds decide to lift. I believe (if that should happen) that there is medication for it. Toenails seem to be okay so far but, given that we're still experiencing warm weather here on southern Ontario, I'm still wearing sandals and am trying to be very careful not to stub my toes and possibly start some kind of reaction. And speaking of feet, I've noticed that my heels became quite dry and were starting to crack, so I took the advice of someone who posted here that they started using Dr. Scholl'sHeel Balm -- and it really works! So, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure (or should that be gram and kilogram??). Please keep us posted on how you manage with taxotere. By all accounts, it's just about the best defense against those nasty bc cells.

Toenails seem to be okay so far but, given that we're still experiencing warm weather here on southern Ontario, I'm still wearing sandals and am trying to be very careful not to stub my toes and possibly start some kind of reaction. And speaking of feet, I've noticed that my heels became quite dry and were starting to crack, so I took the advice of someone who posted here that they started using Dr. Scholl'sHeel Balm -- and it really works!

"1b64032c-3f4c-42a0-95fb-45612d0fe400","Hi Lisa:Ohmy,you're right --I didn't mention anything about nail problems. Yes, generally the taxotere does affect one's nails -- fingers and toes. The nail beds may become quite tender (a bit of an anomaly since the fingertips can become quite numb!!). You may develop horizontal ridges starting at the base of the nail and these ridges (sometimes one for each treatment) will be lighter in colour. The nails might (and I emphasize might) lift -- basically to make room for a new nail growing underneath. You might find that your nails develop dark streaks and/or discolour somewhat.

I finished my FEC-D treatments on October 31 and I'm glad that the major side effects are almost gone. Keep in mind that everyone reacts to chemo differently but here is what I experienced. I found the FEC part worst than the D. The main reason for that was the nausea and the fog that came with FEC. While the meds prevented me from vomiting, I felt queasy. Make sure to mention any nausea to your oncologist, they will adjust the meds. I did get some body aches with the D but no nausea and while I had fatigue it wasn't as bad as with FEC. I had to learn to draw my brows but I only started losing them when I started the D. I lost my hair with FEC and it very slowly started to come back with D. I found that using a powder brow corrector worked better than a pencil since I still have some brows left. The pencil clumped up in what little I have left in my brows and looked bad. The cosmetic counter might be a good place to start for help on doing your brows. As for the flu shot, my oncologist recommended that I wait until my immune system gets stronger before getting it. I might not get the full benefit of the shot if I have a low immune system. Check with your oncologist for a recommendation.

I already had my lumpectomy and am stage 1, so I have no real idea of how much this is helping other than by reading about the studies and statistics. I got so many of the SE's - not quite all of them, but most of them. We'll see how it goes with just Herceptin for the next 9 mos. Re. mouth sores, I found two things that really seemed to help. BMX helped to ease the pain - it's a mix of lidocaine, maalox, and pepto bismol, your phamacist can mix it w/a prescription. It makes your mouth numb for the first ~20 minutes, but then the painkilling effect seemed to linger for a good while. Second, my acupuncturist told me to suck on mints to help saliva production, which helps to protect the mouth. I did this faithfully during rounds 2 & 3 and didn't get any mouth sores even though my mouth was (and still is) pretty dry. But now I can't wait to just heal.

"1ce3710a-c257-4828-bb7f-efd73e28b840","i was diagnosed in March 2013. I am 50. I had stage 2 Invasice ductal carcinoma in my left breast . 100% progesterone positive. 95% estrogen positive. I opted for a doublr mastectomy. No cancer was found in my lymph nodes but the surgeon said it looked like a few escaped into my lymph channels. I had 6 rounds of chemo. One every 3 weeks of taxotere and cytoxan. It was brutal. I even lost a tooth from it. I fought to keep my strength and walked and exercised when I felt better after every treatment. The oncologist said although I am canver free , I had to go on tamoxifen because of my hormones and to prevent reoccurrence . I am borderline menopausal . I have hot flashes and have not had a period since chemo. I was on tamoxifen for 9 days and had a bad reaction to it. I had bad vertigo, migraines and fatigue. I felt like I had fluid in my head. I couldnt function. Everytime i went to walk I would almost fall and always felt nauseous. The Oncologist told me to stop taking it. I was better immediately after I stoppedThey then said arimidex. But they want me to do 6 mos of lupron shots also. I have researched lupron and the side effects are awful. Some side effects are irreversible. i have anxiety over the thought of it . I called the omcologist and told then my concerns but they won't give me arimidex unless i do lupron , but if i get a hysterectomy i won't have to do lupron. The Gynecologist told me that insurance wont ok the surgery unless I try lupron first. I cannot believe that I am basically being told that although tbhis medicine can cause severe side effects, that I have to take it or I cannot have other preventative treatment. When i first stopped chemo I was already exercising and feeling wonderful. Those 9 days of tamoxifen were torture. I felt like I was sick all over again. Like I took 10 steps backwarda with my recovery. Now I feel healthy again. I look healthy. I exercise vigorously an hour a day. Jump rope. Lift weights. Do plyometric workouts . I am 5'1 and the only thing that changed is that I am 106 pounds . I gained 4 pounds during chemo and I can't seem to lose it . But really its just 4 pounds. The point I am trying to make is that i feel human again and I don't want to go on more medicines and be sick all of the time. I don't want my life to be about side effects. I choose quality of life over the amount of days in my life. I am going to look online and see if there is a diet i can follow and supplements I can take to help me do this naturally because at this point I am so scared of what the lupron can do , that there is now way I can let them start injecting me with it. I start to have anxiety attacks . Yet I want to live and feel like my options are . Take this medicine even though you are afraid to teke it. Even though there are chances of severe side effects or take a chance at reoccurrence because insurance won't pay for the hysterectomy.

I opted for a doublr mastectomy. No cancer was found in my lymph nodes but the surgeon said it looked like a few escaped into my lymph channels. I had 6 rounds of chemo. One every 3 weeks of taxotere and cytoxan. It was brutal. I even lost a tooth from it. I fought to keep my strength and walked and exercised when I felt better after every treatment. The oncologist said although I am canver free , I had to go on tamoxifen because of my hormones and to prevent reoccurrence . I am borderline menopausal . I have hot flashes and have not had a period since chemo. I was on tamoxifen for 9 days and had a bad reaction to it. I had bad vertigo, migraines and fatigue. I felt like I had fluid in my head. I couldnt function. Everytime i went to walk I would almost fall and always felt nauseous. The Oncologist told me to stop taking it. I was better immediately after I stoppedThey then said arimidex. But they want me to do 6 mos of lupron shots also. I have researched lupron and the side effects are awful. Some side effects are irreversible. i have anxiety over the thought of it . I called the omcologist and told then my concerns but they won't give me arimidex unless i do lupron , but if i get a hysterectomy i won't have to do lupron. The Gynecologist told me that insurance wont ok the surgery unless I try lupron first. I cannot believe that I am basically being told that although tbhis medicine can cause severe side effects, that I have to take it or I cannot have other preventative treatment. When i first stopped chemo I was already exercising and feeling wonderful. Those 9 days of tamoxifen were torture. I felt like I was sick all over again. Like I took 10 steps backwarda with my recovery. Now I feel healthy again. I look healthy. I exercise vigorously an hour a day. Jump rope. Lift weights. Do plyometric workouts . I am 5'1 and the only thing that changed is that I am 106 pounds . I gained 4 pounds during chemo and I can't seem to lose it . But really its just 4 pounds. The point I am trying to make is that i feel human again and I don't want to go on more medicines and be sick all of the time. I don't want my life to be about side effects. I choose quality of life over the amount of days in my life. I am going to look online and see if there is a diet i can follow and supplements I can take to help me do this naturally because at this point I am so scared of what the lupron can do , that there is now way I can let them start injecting me with it. I start to have anxiety attacks . Yet I want to live and feel like my options are . Take this medicine even though you are afraid to teke it. Even though there are chances of severe side effects or take a chance at reoccurrence because insurance won't pay for the hysterectomy.

"1d00348b-3d09-4f2c-8c8d-71f26b1da169","Has anyone who is receiving, or has recently completed, chemotherapy experienced worsening vaginal pain, dryness, and urinary urgency? I finished the TCH regimen (Taxotere, carboplatin, herceptin) on June 2 which was the last of 6 cycles, and am continuing on Herceptin alone. Around the end of the 4th cycle and especially after the 5th, I developed worsening vaginal and urethral pain and dryness and started feeling like I have to urinate all the time, and on 2 occasions also had some oozing of blood from the vaginal wall. Was treated once for a urinary tract infectiona which totally cleared up, and all subsequent urine tests have been completely negative. But the symptoms have persisted and are so bothersome, interfering with daily functioning and even walking at times. Since my tumor was ER/PR negative, my doctors agreed to let me go on a short course of vaginal estrogen to help the tissues heal. I am 58 and did not have this problem before chemo, even after menopause. The problem does not yet seem to be significantly improving, and no one can seem to tell me how long it will take. I am also wondering how long after completing chemo will I start regaining a normal appetite and at least some energy. Thanks in advance for any responses relating similar experiences.

"1d83e0e4-016b-482c-9999-cefbdfa0f789","letlet - I have been using minoxidil (the 2%) for the past 20 years. After menopause I lost a lot of hair on the top part of my head and was so upset about how it looked that I began minoxidil and for me it was very effective; it took about 3 months before I saw any growth. Fast forward about 16 years and I was diagnosed with BC. I did not do chemo but when put on tamoxifen I began experiencing the same kind of hair loss again. I had not stopped using the minoxidil so was very discouraged to realize that tamoxifen was the cause. Eventually (it took about 6 months) my hairdresser said she could see lots of new hairs growing in. So finally my hair doesn't look so thin but the top is growing very slowly (sides and back grow much faster). My hope is that when off of T my hair on the top of my head will resume its normal rate of growth. In the meantime, I am still using the minoxidil and would not dare stop or I would lose what I have gained. You might be pleasantly surprised at how well the 2% can work.","began","i","420","RB","367","experienc","loss","376","tamoxifen","424","8","IN","when","0","hair","NULL","8","IN","kind","put","NN","of","drug-SE","on","NN","FALSE","NULL","WRB","NULL","NN","again","loss","PRP","VBG","NULL","tamoxifen","false","1","VBD","NN","0","false","10","valid","VB","25","1","1","44","80","80","44","123","131","9","8","98"

"1dbb4637-b63f-4efb-8576-24260f1278a1","Spinnerpom, I can certainly relate to your concerns about tamoxifen but none the less, I'm quite surprised at your RO recommending against taking it. Have you had onco type testing on the tumor? That should definitively give you some answers about recurances, stats etc both with the drug and without. As far as the rest of the SE's you've mentioned, I think some of the, happen more from the radiation than from the AI in my case. Mand the weight gain goes just the other way for some people. All this is by way of saying, that this is an intensely personal choice for each of us, and it's one of the only ones we can change our mind about. Momine, purple sounds a bit weird to me. I turned dark brown perhaps almost purple, and got some red areas after radiation, but what you've got sounds different to me. Is it swollen? Is it oozing? Is it painful? I think like Kingjr said, keep lotion on it, and if it starts any of those things too I think a call to the RO would be in order. Oh, BTW, I lay on my cancer side all the time. I just have to be careful about how I get there. For me, laying on my stomach is totally out of the question. Hi IRW. how you doing this morning? Just think, no more gall bladder attacks! Hurrah!

"1dd8a4fd-c8c9-4842-a01e-524f891b6e31","Big news for me today. After the initial culture came back negative last week, my plastic surgeon was frustrated so had them grow it. He just got the results today that it is pseudonomas aeruginosa, mild on one side, moderate on the other. Not a good bug to have. However, I have few symptoms except pinkness of my breast, and a very low grade fever once a week. Other than that, I feel great. Plastic surgeon talked to my oncologist (they are next door to each other) who told him I can have surgery with the chemo I am on, expecially since I am on chemo only to mix it with the herceptin that is really important in my case. So, he started me on cipro today (second time. but we didn't know what the infection was last time since it came back negative),and has set surgery for next Monday. If he gets in there and it isn't bad, which he is hoping since I don't have many symptoms, he will flush it all out with antibiotics and whatever else they use, and put in my permanent implants. I am fully expanded and will be either 525 or 550. He said with my TE size now, I should be pretty similar, and I am a little bigger than what I would like so that should work. In a worst case scenario, the infection will be too nasty and he will have to take everything out and start over in a couple of months, which will suck, but he assures me we canmove pretty quickly if that is the case. Whippetmom, I finally told him that you agreed with his assessment of siz and type and he is all puffed up now, grinning away. even went out and told his assistant. Then I added to it by telling him that my urologist (had a kidney stone two weeks ago) said I had a great plastic surgeon. Now there will be no containing him, but I thought he could use the positive reinforcement before surgery. LOLThe best part of this story is my oncologist, whom I also love to death. He is an Indian guy, a yoga master, and the most positive of people. When I stopped by his office to drop off this info, and tell him surgery was Monday, he said, in he perfect Indian accent, ""Well, unless there is bad infection, you can still come for your chemo on Tuesday morning with no problem, and to have the ps call him after surgery and let him know!"" Now there is an optimistic guy. So. I am breaking all my plastic surgeons rules. He like to wait three months (I will be just over two months) and he likes to wait one month after chemo is done (I am halfway through on 12 weeks of weekely taxol-no side effects and blood counts are all good-including the ones that should recognize infection-go figure). Poor guy. So send some prayers my way for a positive outcome that involves a chest of some kind. LOL. I probably won't be on too much more until after surgery as I now have to go on a major cleaning initiative in the next five days, as well as try to figure out what all I need to have ready for after surgery. He said not drains though unless there is something that requires it, so I am thrilled about that!

"1ea1098a-426f-4673-975d-98e122138b81","In 2009, during my third year on tamoxifen, I was diagnosed with Age-related macular degeneration. I had cataract surgery on one eye during those years. Recently I was diagnosed with wet macular degeneration. Although the question, ""Have you ever taken tamoxifen"" was on the forms I filled out in the retinal specialist's office, I was told tamoxifen was NOT the cause of this. ? How do they know? While I was on Tamoxifen, I read only that it can cause changes in vision. Now it appears this can be serious. Age-related macular degeneration is not to be taken lightly. Eventually all central vision is lost, which I am losing now. I took Tamoxifen for five years minus 8 days when I discovered I had a blood clot. Had I known about this side effect, I might have shortened the number of years I took it. I am at high risk of having cancer again, so in spite of the aches and pains (I now use a cane and a rollator) to walk, I stayed on it. Not one of my doctors mentioned this side effect to me--that I could go partially blind. From what I am reading now, anyone on Tamoxifen should have a baseline eye exam within the first year of treatment including an examination of the macula and testing central and color vision. They should be followed every four to six months. Any sign of ocular conditions should prompt a discussion with the patient as well as the oncologist. Was my oncologist ever advised about my ""vision problems?"" I certainly was not. I had no idea I was not seeing colors correctly until I mentioned the green walls in the doctors' office. My dau told me they were brown. Although I was telling my ophthalmologist my harp strings looked wavy, venetian blinds were making little ""vs,"" it seemed no one was listening to me. It was only when a test in his office showed I had two cysts on the macula, were my symptoms taken seriously. I went next door to a retinal specialist who gave me a shot of Avastin in my eye. This will not restore the vision I have lost.

"1ed8c7bd-712a-495e-955e-455e3db13664","Good evening to all my fellow cruisers, Went to MD Anderson today and all is well. He only did a very thorough hands on physical exam. I will return every 6 months. No scans or blood work. My genetic testing was negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2. Thank goodness. Twilah, I love you new avitar, what beautiful thick hair. I agree with you about the ""wrecked body"". I feel like I am 100 yrs old sometimes. Especially if I sit for awhile. When I get up it takes a few steps to get going. I believe the Arimidex SE have kicked in. I am having some edema in my feet and ankles. I started on CoQ10 and Biotin. I am not sure if either one of these could cause the edema. Dr. Booser didn't think the Arimidex is causing it. Twilah, I hope you continue to do well on the chemo. It will be overwith before you know it. Remember when I started FAC after all of you finished AC. You were all so supportive and generous to me. We will all be here for you, as well. Jan, your curls are adorable. How long after your last chemo did it take for significant hair growth? My husband and I did one of those seasons of the TV show 24 on a weekend. It was cold and rainy. We watched it until wee hours and then slept awhile and got up and watched some more all weekend. It was fun. Hillary, I love your picture. Nice to put a face with a name. How are you doing back at work? How was your son's first day of school? Phyl and Carynn, I am in the same class as you with the animal hair. I have 3 indoor cats and one outside cat. The o.c. gets hair on me when I go outside and he like to be picked up and held. Does the Roomba really work? I need something for cat hair. Marsha, I was fasting before I had my blood drawn. My onc at MD Anderson didn't seem to think the chemo caused it, so go figure. I am going to ask the internist to hold off until it has been 60 days post chemo, to have my blood drawn again. Cute bench dance. You go girl! Hooray about your surgery. I was doing a dance of joy after reading that post. Thank God. I was so worried for you, being a lobular girl myself, I feel very strongly that both breasts need to be removed. I am surprised it is a Day Surgery procedure. However, mine was bil. mastectomies with lymph node dissection. I am sure if I had only had the simple mastectomy alone it wouldn't have been such a big deal. Actually, I prefer to go home as soon as possible. Wish I was close by to be your private nurse. I have two friends that are RN's and they always come home and stay with me after surgery. The sooner the better. Don't want any hospital acquired infections. LOL. but seriously you don't want one of those. Terry, what a horrible experience you had with your port. Your friend and her mother are in my thoughts and prayers. God bless them. About the cholesterol and triglyserides, I agree with you about the steroids. They have wrecked havoc on me. The weight gain 12 lbs. and the lipids. I wished I had refused them, but I was afraid of nausea. Of course, nausea might have helped with the weight. LOL. But it is so yuck. I just wanted to avoid nausea at all costs. MelanieW, I am so glad they could fix up you DH. What a scary thing. Thank goodness for medical technology. Catherine, How were the brain scans for you and your husband? Be sure and let us know. Hmmm, strawberries and shrimp. You do cook some wonderful sounding meals. I wish it wasn't so hot here. And it has been raining off and on everyday. I really need to put new bark in all my beds, but I want to spray weeds with weed killer first and can't catch a day without rain to wash it off before it works. Yes, we were very fortunate to dodge the ""bullet"", so to speak with the Hurricane Dean. Even a category I or II storm does alot of damage. We had one 3 years ago and some folks were without electricity for a week. Dreadful. Karen, I was post menopausal before breast cancer, so has dealt with urgency incontenance, which HRT helped. The testosterone I was on helped libido, but caused increased facial hair. Can't win. Now with the ""extinction"" of estrogen in my body, some of the problems are back. Oh joy. About the facial hair, I just shave it off. It does not come back thicker or coarser. And not so painful as waxing, tweezing or electrolysis. I bought something like Nioxin, but double strenght to put on my fuzzy head, hoping some real hair will come in. Leah and Alyson, hope you are both healing and feeling more comfortable. You remain on my mind and in my prayers. Keep us posted on your progress. Well, sorry this is so long. Been awhile since I posted. Got behind. Thanks to Vegas and all of you with information about port removal. Sure made me less anxious about how red and angry mine was looking. It is fine now. Hugs and warm thoughts to all.

"1ef90f45-b24e-4808-96ab-e78db9c82690","Joan - I too have male pattern baldness and have used Minoxidil for the past 15 years or so and it was/is effective. I did not have to do chemo however while on Tamoxifen I began to lose hair, and lots of it. This too freaked me out. I had worked so hard to have a rather normal looking head of hair. And, of course, the worry that it would just keep on falling out as long as I was on Tamoxifen. Now two and one half years have passed (I am still on T) and lots of new hairs began growing in, starting about 10 months ago. I have very few really long ones left (most came out) and the new ones are a variety of lengths. It is a crazy amount of time to try and deal with all the different lengths, and it grows at a ridiculously slow rate. I never stopped using the minoxidil and perhaps it helped the hair regrow. Have you ever tried Minoxidil? I am not complaining, at least I have hair, but I understand your fear!","began","i","182","NN","161","to","lose","170","tamoxifen","186","3","IN","howev","0","to","CC","4","VBD","i","while","TO","began","drug-SE","on","PRP","FALSE","lot","RB","NNS","VB","hair","lose","PRP","TO","and","Tamoxifen","false","1","VBD","NNP","0","false","5","valid","IN","25","1","8","98","25","1","44","123","8","44","123","8"
"1f1b937c-2ae6-4df0-a532-3ad50db7b324","Hey all, So round 1 of TC down! And I have to say not too bad (yet)! It was a long day. reported at doc's office at 1:45. Walking in the door at home at 7:30pm. I am proud to say I made it through the treatments well, no flushing with the Taxotere and I enjoyed my ipod ""Happy Hour"" playlist and read a mindless magazine. I hit the bed like a lead balloon, had a little bit of nausea and sleeplessness until I took the ativan. (thank the Lord for that stuff!) Today was okay. Better in the afternoon. i would liken it to a hangover. I did take a brief ride in the convertible with my hubby. Of course with BIG hat and shades, but the fresh air did me good! Will see what tomorrow brings! At the doc yesterday I asked about supplements, my doc is in totally concurrence with no supplements except VitD. Pickles, I am sorry for your rash. drat that! Ttrechred, My heart aches for your hubby too. Mine has had a pretty positive outlook, but trust me we have shed a few tears. Just an idea, a dear friend of mine gave my hubby a book called ""breast cancer husband"". He's not much of a reader but we put it in the bathroom (LOL) and I think it is really helping him a lot!!! I can get you the author if you like. Oh, and good news from my doctor yesterday. though my oncotype test conflicted with my hospital labs, she feels fairly confident after retesting that my tumor is at least somewhat receptive to Estrgen so I should be able to take tamoxifen, hopefully with some positive effects in the future! YAY! And Irish, I am with you. I can't imagine not being informed on my own body like the other women in the waiting room. wow. also, sorry you are whacked! But you are amazing!

Like liters of it every day. She said this was a good thing to do because it keeps the chemo from sitting in your body and heightening the SEs. I was given steroids, emend and neulasta with the AC (which I had dose dense every two weeksx 4.  i.e. for 8 weeks). For taxol and first herceptin there were ancillary drugs given in the drip (benedryl and other anti allergy meds) to prevent an allergic reaction (not sure if it was a reaction to Herceptin alone -- which I KNOW has an allergic reaction for some -- or whether I also got it with the Taxol). Since you're not Her2+ you won't be getting Herceptin. Anyway the Emend (anti nausea medicine) was stopped once the AC was done (because Taxol and Herceptin don't make you nauseous). but steroids continued for 8more weeks (taxol dosedense every 2 weeksx 4= another eight weeks of treatment). So for 16 weeks in all I had steroids once every 2 weeks (or a total ofeight 24 hour periods). I would not worry too much about the spike with the steroids. Mine was always under 300 and my doctor was very pleased with that. Then within 24 hours of the TX my blood sugar was back down under 120 (and often was 80 -90, which is excellent). The low carb diet will help. I did get some slight neuropathy in my feet during the Taxol, which got worse as the treatment continued; it felt like I was walking on golfballs (not a comfy feeling) and lasted longer after each TX until, by the second to last one, it continued the whole two weeks. About 6 weeks after finishing the chemo the feeling was completely gone. Stamina took longer to build back up but I'm feeling 100% normal now and I finished chemo in October 2009. The neulasta is to help your white blood count. I forgot to mention in the PM that about 3 - 4 weeks into the AC (so some time after the second transfusion but close to the third) I went to a salad bar and ate raw veggies which, it turns out, you can NOT do when you are on chemo (but no one told me or, if they told me, I forgot or did not hear it). Raw veggies and fruits with thin skinshave bacteria on them, naturally (from the ground),that the body normally can kill off with no issue (the stomach acid destroys it, basically). But when your immune system is compromised -- and that is what chemo does to you -- you are vulnerable to that. So I got food poisoning, basically, and ended up in the hospital on an antibiotic IV drip when I spiked a fever of 101. I think the hospital was overkill -- I felt fine the whole time I was there and one IV drip dropped my temp to normal within hours. But if I could take it back I would not have dined on salad. After that, I stopped eating any veggies unless they were cooked (so no more salads) and only ate fruit with a thick skin (like canteloupe).","were","there","545","RB","437","ancillari","allerg","446","herceptin","562","17","JJ","taxol","0","an","JJ","9","VB","to","and","DT","prevent","drug-SE","first","TO","FALSE","if","NN","IN","JJ","not","allergic reaction","EX","JJ","sure","herceptin","false","1","VBD","NN","0","false","12","invalid","CC","102","25","6","44","44","44","8","123","142","8","131","8"

I just started chemo on July 2nd. I had my port installed on the 1st, but for the first infusion they used an IV line. I can't wait until the incision settles and heals up. It's still a little sore. I'm getting 6 rounds of taxotere every three weeks (plus herceptin and perjeta indefinitely). So far the nausea has been well controlled, but the dry mouth/sore throat/taste changes have been pretty severe. Also just general achey-ness and fatigue. Luckily, I'm on medical leave so I can sleep and rest as much as possible. I chopped my waist length hair into a pixie and will probably buzz cut it before it falls out. I'll look into getting a wig soon, but I plan on using scarves more (I've picked up a bunch and they seem more comfortable to wear than a wig).

I thought about it after about a a year and a half on Arimidex, but thought it would be less effective; also one onc I talked to thought it might actually be risky to switch to Tamoxifen after so long on Arimidex. So I stuck it out with Arimidex. But just recently I read the results of a large clinical trial that showed that two years of an AI followed by three years of Tamoxifen is just as good as five years of an AI in terms of recurrence. Now after five years of Arimidex I have developed osteorporosis, vaginal atrophy and suffered five years of pain in every joint as well as increasing brain fog. While Tamoxifen has its own side effects, it is not associated with the kind of damage that the AIs do to some of us. Tamoxifen actually helps bones, does not promote atrophy, and I hear causes much less joint pain and cognitive deficit. I really think you should give it a try and see if you feel better.

So I stuck it out with Arimidex. But just recently I read the results of a large clinical trial that showed that two years of an AI followed by three years of Tamoxifen is just as good as five years of an AI in terms of recurrence. Now after five years of Arimidex I have developed osteorporosis, vaginal atrophy and suffered five years of pain in every joint as well as increasing brain fog. While Tamoxifen has its own side effects, it is not associated with the kind of damage that the AIs do to some of us. Tamoxifen actually helps bones, does not promote atrophy, and I hear causes much less joint pain and cognitive deficit. I really think you should give it a try and see if you feel better.

I was very concerned that the drug wasn't working for me as I have absolutely no hot flashes, no joint pain andbasically noneof the major side effects which would seemingly prove the drug was being metabolised correctly. It is particularly important for me as I am premenopausal (age 47) and didn't do chemo due to an Oncotype score of 6. The results came back 2 weeks ago and apparently I am an Extensive Metaboliser. Like Jodi above in her post she had extreme side effects and the test came back that she wasn't a good metaboliser. Obviously we are all so individual and if there is a test which can give us an insight into the efficacy of a drug then it should be embraced. I for one would have certainly had my ovaries removed if I was a low metaboliser, which I still might do if my BRCA1 and BRCA2 test results come back positive. I am only one of 14 women who have had the Oncotype DX test done over here in Australia (at great expense) and this CYP2D6 test is just another tool to determine treatment for women like myself who haven't done chemo and are premenopausal.soft hugsHelena","just","for","140","WDT","57","on","anxieti","66","tamoxifen","163","15","IN","have","0","some","VBP","1","IN","other","been","DT","than","drug-SE","on","JJ","FALSE","to","VBP","TO","NN","which","anxiety and mood swings","IN","IN","seem","tamoxifen","false","1","RB","NN","0","false","8","valid","VBN","25","25","44","131","1","8","9","44","25","8","8","1"

Sure hope those rads are doing a lot of damage to the mets. Here's the WW Pork Piccata recipe that a couple of people were interested in. In a small bowl, combine 3 T. all-purpose flour, 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper. Cut 1 lb. lean pork tenderloin into 16 pieces. Flour both sides of pork medallions, shaking off excess. Heat 2 tsp. olive oil (I used 1 T.) in large skillet over med.-high heat. Cook pork medallions about 1 1/2 min. on both sides until golden brown. Set aside on serving plate and cover to keep warm. In a cup, whisk together 3/4 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth, 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice, 2 tsp. cornstarch, 1/4 tsp. salt and 1/8 tsp black pepper. Pour into same skillet and whisk to combine with drippings. Simmer until slightly thickened. Remove skillet from heat. Stir in 2 tsp. salted butter until melted. (I used 1 T. butter) Stir in 1 T. capers, drained. (I rinsed the capers) Spoon sauce over pork. I made this dish about an hour ahead of time. I returned the pork medallions to the skillet, spooned sauce over them and covered the skillet with a lid. When dh and I had finished our drinks and were ready to eat, I warmed up the medallions and sauce. Recipe Note: the sauce is lemony. I'm not cooking tonight! Yay! DH and I are going to a neighbor's house to play a couple of games of pool. Then the four of us are going to a nice restaurant for dinner. I checked out the menu last night on my computer and have my choices narrowed down to three selections in the seafood section of the menu.","take","i","137","CC","31","mg","warm","40","tamoxifen","149","17","RB","arimidex","0","get","RB","4","PRP","fluctuat","generic","VBP","i","drug-SE","not","NN","FALSE","hot","NN","JJ","JJ","but","warm flushes","PRP","NN","not","tamoxifen","false","3","VBP","NN","0","false","6","invalid","JJ","44","-1","48","44","44","28","44","63","78","89","44","44"

Hoping you have mild SEs. Sunshine, I have had 3 TCs and I know I have a brain fog. Sometimes I just can't remember certain words or phrases. I am still working, but doing simple things now. No complex problems. Which is usually what I do. I work at a nuclear power plant and write procedures and maintain a software package. Sometimes I just can't think things through. But I have a helper that takes up the slack and I am not worried about her taking over my job. We generally do two separate things and just work on this one project together. I have not had a hard time with the Taxotere, but I am so fatigued and it just kicks my WBC completely off the chart. I am home bound now waiting for my WBC to come up. You know there are laws that they have to hold your job for so many weeks, I think it is 12, if you go out on family leave. So maybe it will not be as bad as you think. Good luck to you and I hope it all works out for you. Well the old WBC is down down down and I am home bound again for the 3rd time. I will get a Neupogen shot everyday, that is if my insurance company will let me bring some home for the weekend. Anyway, I got a shot today and will get another tomorrow. I had a few things I wanted to do this weekend, but I guess they are all out. I just have to remind myself that I only have one more to go and this part will be over. By the way I did mention to the Onc about my fingers and toes tingling and the restless leg syndrome.

I'm starting to see the light, but now I'm getting nervous about the Taxol. Overall, I'm feeling ok on the AC, but I had some constipation early on with bleeding. It has still continued so they sent me to a gastroenterologist today. She feels 99% sure it's just hemorroids, but wants to do a colonoscopy just to be sure. Not fun! I'm also having what I think is neuropathy in my feet. I go on Thursdays for my tx and then on Sunday, my feet start burning and hurting when I walk. It started in the heel area and this week it was more in the ball area. It lasts until Tuesday and then it is much better. The nurses and doc have no clue what it is as neuropathy does not usually occur with AC. But, I found another lady on the chemo forum who said she had the same thing happen. Other than that, everything is good. We are heading out on vacation on Friday. I wasn't sure I would feel up to going as we had this scheduled well before my dx, but I'm feeling pretty good. My dh is a scout leader and we are going to a scout training ranch in New Mexico. He gets to spend the day going through training stuff, and the kids are sent off in their age groups for activities (horseback riding, etc.).

They all said they didn't mind and if it bothered someone too bad. Some people looked but never said anything and now they all comment on how much my hair has grown and how they like the color - salt and pepper, getting more pepper every day. I have been taking Tamoxifen since the beginning of May and had very little side effects until recently. I am having continual hot flashes and it is really a big pain in the rear. My hair is constantly wet and sweat drips down my face - I don't sweat anyplace else. I can't even stand to be outside right now because of the heat - it makes me very queasy. My air conditioner is constantly running and my poor children are freezing and covering up with blankets in the house. Also I have been having bad cramps in both my feet and legs.

I had a bone scan on Monday and should get the results on Friday when I meet with my medical oncologist. Had a CT scan last week due to some neck swelling (of all things!) and it showed hazy areas in my lungs that my rad oncol thought was leftover radiation residue. Not very reassuring though! But I've also had a terrible cold/cough so I'm wondering if that had anything to do with it. And I had a cyst in my sinus cavity (of all things!) so I'm wondering if that is what is making all these allergies worse. To top it all off, my eyelashes have fallen out again! I think this is probably due to the tamoxifen taking my estrogen levels down and throwing me into a medical menopause, but I cannot tell you how much this irritated me. The little things, right?

Unknown long-term side effects versus the possibility of recurrence once you stop. If AI's prevent recurrences by stopping all estrogen. then what's toprevent it once you start producing estrogen again? There needs to be more research into WHY and HOW there are so many 'late' recurrences with ER+ bc; it can be no coincidence that these happen AFTER AI therapy is stopped. One year or even 20 years down the line. That's the really scary part for me.

He literally laughed at me and said no. Two weeks after starting tamo at age 51 I was painfully dry. (What do THEY know! It isn't their body.) I stopped using tamo for a bit but alas, nothing improved. I talked with my PCP about it, who had no answers. I then went back to my onc and his only reaction was ""Why aren't you talking to your PCP about this?"" (The rotten buck passer.)

I'm very self conscious about wearing a wig, and even my scarf. but since I have to choose one or the other I'm using the scarf like lots of you wig is just too itchy. I have some stubble, left I'm praying I won't loose it with taxotere and hoping it will just grow. I know most likely it will fall but I'm trying to keep positive. since I lost my hair I really don't want ppl I know to see me like this. I have limited myself to immediate family. I get the is only hair, yet when they get a very short hair cut they complain is too short. is like well try being bald now.","hope","and","611","PRP","499","it","lost","507","taxoter","623","22","IN","loos","0","i","RB","4","IN","posit","it","PRP","sinc","drug-SE","with","JJ","FALSE","do","VB","VBP","VBD","i","lost my hair","CC","PRP","realli","taxotere","false","3","VBG","NN","0","false","5","invalid","PRP","8","44","1","44","44","44","25","125","44","49","123","44"

It sounds as if you are doing exactly what I did last May, trying to read everyone's story while you gather information so that you know what lies ahead. As the other ladies have said, learn everything you can, but remember, everyone is different and will react differently. As for me, I am just finishing up treatment, I have one more to go (can you believe it ladies?) Chemo for mewell went fairly well. The main side effect was fatigue and even that was managed by a few good naps and slowing down. I'm a substitute teacher, so I didn't have to worry about work. Since the summer is naturally a slower pace, it worked out well for me. My suggestion is to prepare yourself, but try not to obsess. I found that many things I worried about never came to fruition. Take things one day at a time. JILL: It's so good to hear from you! I'm sorry to hear about the hernia. Gosh, it seems if it isn't one thing it's another! However, I'm glad that you're not in too much pain. You sound busy, but wonderful! It appears that the ""hectic"" life agrees with you. I must admit, I'm a little jealous. I've been feeling like a jellyfish lately. Since I don't have work pushing me and giving direction to my daily activities, I feel like I'm aimlessly floating along without much to do. I try to appease myself by thinking that if I'm bored it's a good thing, because if I were really sick, I wouldn't be bored, I'd be ill and in bed! I'm not looking forward to the beginning of school for my kids and not going back to work myself. CRISTLC: I've been popping over to the hair thread where I see your postings. I can't wait to be able to watch my hair come back in. Curly, gray, salt and pepper, whatever comes, I'll take! My face is too round to not have hair! To catch you all up with me, as I mentioned, I have one more chemo treatment to go. I finished with the A/C and moved onto Taxol. The second Taxol gave me an bad reaction, so my Doctor switched to Abrazane (spelling?) That was much better. I will finish up the day after Labor Day. Four weeks after that, I will have surgery. July was filled with me trying to gather as much information as I could about implants or using my own tissue in a free flap procedure called DEIP. I've decided to go with using my own tissue, although I'm a bit concerned because the surgery is expected to be 8-10 hours and recovery period is about 6 weeks. I'm not looking forward to that,but once I'm healed it should be over, and I can get back to getting my life in order and back on track. and that I am looking forward to! That's it for now.

Sherbear. Exciting to hear you have 11 embryos waiting for you! I had my one and only son at 37 after having to use fertility meds and it's worth anything you have to endure. He's the love of my life! Menopause. I'm hoping mine stays! I was still havingperiods up until chemo and I'm 50. A very YOUNG 50, however! :o) With any luck everything will have synchronized and my hot flashes will be over and done with, although I am on Tamoxifen for 5 years.

"2a85dd51-2808-4dc8-87e7-29915d8d1d90","Hi, I just finished my 6th treatment of Taxol. My BP goes up everytime for three to four days. I get joint pain in my knees and also feel like my arms weigh a ton and kind of ache after I put them up to get something over my head. A little weird huh? I am starting to get the tingling in my fingers and it seems my hands and feet are always cold to the touch. I get chilled pretty easy but then I can really hot jut the same. I think my body temp is having trouble regulating to the Taxol. I am not running a fever. I also got a migraine like Carolben, actually the same day as she did. Now my head just feels like it is in a vice all the time. I am taking benedryl with my pain meds because they may be giving me the headache. I've read wear that can happen. I don't wake up with the headache it comes after I start the pain meds. The benedryl has helped with that. I have to take Ambien at night to get to sleep. The second time I had Taxol I was up all night because of the steriods, it didn't affect me the first time. I told the doc and he gave me Abien. I took it third time I had the steriods and it worked like a charm, only thing is I didn't know I needed to stay on it and didn't sleep the second night at all. By the time I thought I should of take the pill it was too late, I had to get my son up and ready for school and I knew I would be able to do that. Anyway from here on out I am taking my sleeping pill. For some reason it is rare for me to be able to get a nap in. So when I get tired I just lay down and relax for while. I am half way through this first chemo, yeah! I hope you all are doing well. Let me know if any of this sounds familiar to anyone.

While with weekly, it cycles faster. less time feeling bad and less severe side effects, quicker recovery times, but no longer periods of feeling (relatively) well.

I want to wish you all encouragement . you can do this!!!! It is definitely not a walk in the park but the anticipation of chemo was the worse part for me. I was so frigthened and once you have your first treatment you realize that you can do it. If you are getting the Big A you should know that you will pee red for a couple of times. nothing to worry about. very normal. I had a port and never used any cream or anything and never had a problem just a little stick. I will say the hair loss was very tramatic for me . the loss part was hard the bald part was not so bad. and it does grow back. I did TAC x 6, herceptin for a year and have been on arimidex for 2 1/2 years. Be gentle with yourself, accept help when offered and don't be afraid to ask questions.

"2b732ce8-a481-420f-8cf3-8320f8dc1fa9","Hi everyone. I really need your survival stories. I need to get encouraged and find hopes within me again. Please help me. My Mother's cancer is back. Here is my mom's cancer story:She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005. Her breast was not removed but the tumor was. A few of her nodes had cancer too. She received 4 sessions of chemo therapy and about 10 sessions of radiation (if I'm not mistaking) and this was all 4 month before my wedding. :( you can only imagine what a happy bride I was!) She started her normal life after that and was getting checked by her doctor every 6 months. She was on tamoxifen for 6 years. Her bones started getting weak after menopause. So weak that she had a couple of fractures on two different parts or her body (chest and shoulder) by just working and cleaning the house. This goesback to about 12 years ago. she has been taking Calcium pills regularly. After her cancer treatment with tamoxifen, her bones got even weaker. She started complaining about back pain and different part of her body's bone pain from 2 years ago but since she is very timid and she had a bad taste from cancer treatment in her mouth, she refused to go to specialist and everything she went to a doctor, she really didn't tell the doctor how bad she was doing. She was always ended up with pain killers like naproxen or nasal spray to strengthen the bones. This went on for 2 years. Recently her back pain really bothered her and by our push she agreed to go to a specialist. The dr ordered a full body scan with radioactive injection. Also lung scan (don't know what type). The results showsthat she has metastatic cancer in her back/spine, hip, shoulder and a small area in her skull. Also she has lung cancer. The specialist recommendedZometa, AromasinandRadiation. Is any of you strong survivor people out there doing through the same thing? Please leave me your messages as I am really looking forward to read your battle story. God bless you and your loved ones.

They also should have done double mastectomy as I asked (they refused) that would at least eliminate the radiation factor. I didn't read a single case relating Tamoxifen and Zoladex with leukemia.

I am not back to being 100%, not by a long shot, but I feel SO MUCH better now, and I feel more positive about my future. Believe me, I WANTED to stop taking the Tamoxifen, but I kept reminding myself that it was to try to prevent a recurrence, and even though there are NO guarantees, I could never live with myself if I stopped taking it, and then I had a recurrence later. I would always kick myself for NOT taking it. That is how I made the chemo decision, because at first I said NO. but I didn't feel good about my choice. Now, though, when I think about stopping Tamoxifen, I keep reminding myself that the hormone treatment is the most effective tx for us ER+ gals, and that is why I have stuck with it, so far. No I don't live near Kitty Hawk. I live only THREE miles from the NC/SC border, on the far south east coast of NC. I live about 20 miles from Myrtle Beach, SC. It's nice, because it's near the beach!

My question is, i still have quite a bit of joint pain especially in my hips. Not sure if it is from the herceptin, bone marrow recovering from the TC, still residual from the chemo etc. I haven't started my tamoxifen yet. I have the script though - just scared to death to start it. Also, i am still tachycardic around 90-96. Dr. says it is due to the anemia from the chemo. However, i read one of the side effects from herceptin is tachycardia. I think i do know too much being a nurse. My echo after 6 treatments of herceptin remains at 60%! I know i need to get my exercise groove back on. However, they said no step aerobics or kick boxing yet. So i am just gonna do walking and maybe a yoga,pilates, tai chi mix.

"2dc1c30a-59e7-46c8-b7d1-87d79d62ad90","Hello everyone, I am posting to say that yesterday I went for my breast cancer check up with my oncologist and I am glad to be able to post to say that everything was fine. She checked carefully over my mastectomy area, under the arms and all around the neck area and checked my good breast. She was able to discharge me from the hospital. I was very glad to be discharged after almost ten years. It will be ten years in just seven weeks time. I had a nice talk with her and we both said that it was hard to believe that ten years had gone by. She asked me how I was and I said I was fine and that the worst side effect I had from all the treatment was the neuropathy in the feet and she once again said it was due to the chemotherapy (docetaxel, Taxotere). I told her that I could cope with it and that the general feeling was of numbness and roughness, even though to the touch the soles of my feet were soft. Neuropathy does not disappear with time, it is permanent. I thanked her for taking good care of me and shook her hand. Raymond did the same and thanked her for taking good care of me for ten years. At the hospital I got talking to a woman sitting next to me. She remembered me from the previous visit. She had had hormonal breast cancer, was five years from diagnosis and was hoping to be discharged. She was taking Arimidex but was hoping to come off it. She went in before me and gave me the thumbs up as she came out and I went in. I also saw another woman whom I recognised from 2006 when I went for some physiotherapy to get my arm in good shape. She remembered me and we had a little talk. She had had hormonal breast cancer and was volunteering at the hospital. She had been doing it for a long time and was stopping the volunteering this year. She must be about fifteen years since diagnosis. I felt very good as I left the hospital and as embark on a different stage in life, cut loose from hospital visits. I know that I shall continue to be as strict with myself as I have been and not take anything for granted. The oncologist told me that if I have any concerns in the future, to contact her through my GP. As I left the hospital the past ten years seem to run through my head  the trauma of diagnosis, not wanting standard treatment, going to see the homoeopathic consultant, the alternative doctor, making up my mind to go through treatment, going through it and coming out the other end. It was all very emotional because until that day in June 2005 I had never been ill and a world of hospitals, doctors etc. was all rather frightening to me. For those interested you can read my story on line that I did at the invitation of the Moderators.

"2dc1c30a-59e7-46c8-b7d1-87d79d62ad90","Hello everyone, I am posting to say that yesterday I went for my breast cancer check up with my oncologist and I am glad to be able to post to say that everything was fine. She checked carefully over my mastectomy area, under the arms and all around the neck area and checked my good breast. She was able to discharge me from the hospital. I was very glad to be discharged after almost ten years. It will be ten years in just seven weeks time. I had a nice talk with her and we both said that it was hard to believe that ten years had gone by. She asked me how I was and I said I was fine and that the worst side effect I had from all the treatment was the neuropathy in the feet and she once again said it was due to the chemotherapy (docetaxel, Taxotere). I told her that I could cope with it and that the general feeling was of numbness and roughness, even though to the touch the soles of my feet were soft. Neuropathy does not disappear with time, it is permanent. I thanked her for taking good care of me and shook her hand. Raymond did the same and thanked her for taking good care of me for ten years. At the hospital I got talking to a woman sitting next to me. She remembered me from the previous visit. She had had hormonal breast cancer, was five years from diagnosis and was hoping to be discharged. She was taking Arimidex but was hoping to come off it. She went in before me and gave me the thumbs up as she came out and I went in. I also saw another woman whom I recognised from 2006 when I went for some physiotherapy to get my arm in good shape. She remembered me and we had a little talk. She had had hormonal breast cancer and was volunteering at the hospital. She had been doing it for a long time and was stopping the volunteering this year. She must be about fifteen years since diagnosis. I felt very good as I left the hospital and as embark on a different stage in life, cut loose from hospital visits. I know that I shall continue to be as strict with myself as I have been and not take anything for granted. The oncologist told me that if I have any concerns in the future, to contact her through my GP. As I left the hospital the past ten years seem to run through my head  the trauma of diagnosis, not wanting standard treatment, going to see the homoeopathic consultant, the alternative doctor, making up my mind to go through treatment, going through it and coming out the other end. It was all very emotional because until that day in June 2005 I had never been ill and a world of hospitals, doctors etc. was all rather frightening to me. For those interested you can read my story on line that I did at the invitation of the Moderators.

The 3rd day after a sitting i had extreme pain in the legs, I could hardly walk. After the 1st round of Taxotere i had not only the pain in my legs but also sores in my mouth, swollen throat, so that i couldnt swallow, lost all taste buds, even water was horrible but i couldnt drink anything else. I had upper stomach pain etc. Today 6 weeks after i got thru with all my chemo treatments, I still have numb feet , numb fingertips, leg pain, and now on the last three finger nails on the both hands a brown stripe across the nail. I was told the numbness in the fingers and feet can last several months. Good thing is though. no more sores in the mouth and i can taste everything again. thank god. One tip all of you: please be carefull with animal bites and scratches ( dogs and cats ), or any cuts and scratches for that fact. I had a small little hole from my puppy in my hand. playfully biting. Well this hole got infected and i ended up having a complete collapse. I was brought to the hospital and stayed over 4 days. My hadn was operated on 4 days after i was admitted. I was close to a sepsis due to the infection. We are very subceptable to infections the week after taxotere. BE CAREFULL.

"2e83a28c-0f05-437b-90a0-a314d5593dd1","Hi girls. just sneaking in here from the Feb2007 Chemo Cruisers group and thought I'd add my two cents worth (now that I'm done with chemo). I had 4 DD AC followed by 4 DD Taxotere. I tolerated the AC very well. other than feeling generally yechy on Days 3-5 following Tx. The Taxotere was harder for me, believe it or not. My fingers and toes hurt, my eyes watered, I felt like I'd been badly beaten. I got thrush following the last 3 Txs. yech. I finished the T on May 24th. My hair did start to come back during Taxotere and (knock on wood) is still growing like bad weeds. I lost my baby toenails a couple of weeks ago. My fingernails are still sore but not as discolored as some of my BC sisters have described, although they are ridged around the cuticles (it's growing out). My joints started aching much more seriously well after Tx was done. and they still ache. My hands and hips especially.

What a blessing it was. The theme of the conference was STAND. An on time word. For all that I and we have been through here we still manage to STAND for ourselves and for our generations. The praise and worship was awesome. There was women there of every race but we were all there for one purpose to get our minds renewed and our spirits rejouvenated. I left there refreshend and lightweighted. BC is not the only fight I am fighting but it helps to know that I have the tools now to fight and stand through all the enemy has to throw my way. I have the victory in Jesus. Dream (Regina) I usually shy away from post like this because I really don't know how to deal with people talking about the end. I always think as long as theres life theres hope. And with you already planning your end is. sad to me. Maybe because I think of it could be me talking and thinking like this some day and it scares me. I try hard not to think about it especially not knowing much about this dreadful disease and what it can do to you. BC today and something else down the line. I just finished tx March 5th and don't go back for more testing until April. I wonder often what if I am not done. But I know it is not up to me. I put my life in Gods hands and gave him full control. Try hard to hold on to my faith that I am healed. And think I will deal with the end when the end comes. Whether it is today, next week, or 70 years from now. It is not over until it is over. Like Felicia says keep on keepin on. Sharon I hope you are doing well. Taxol is not kickin your but like it did mine. I am still having numbness in my feet and some nerve twitches but other wise doing fine. Yeah I understand about your neighbor. When I came in from the conference my son had a friend spending the night with him. I came in fully dressed and with my wig on. But i went to my room pulled off the wig and breast prosthesis put on my night gown and went down stairs. This kid looked at me like what in the heck. I wasn't even thinking. I laughed so hard. My son is so sweet and always compliments me even when I am at my worst. Told his friend to quit checking out my mom. This boys face was so red (a teenage white kid). I am like a mommy to all of my kids friends and they know I have a good sense of humor and not offended by much. Well I hope you all have a great week ahead and know that I will be praying and thinking about you all.

"2fe6d8b3-3c26-4fd0-b99b-26fbe098ef90","Marybe: I'm glad your Dad agreed to the Christmas party. I think that will be great for both of you! You do need to show off all your hard work!! Livingit: Thanks! Now that I've got it in my mind, I am really looking forward to this change!! As for your question about the ""big guns"", I guess I was referring to ones like Ixempra or Taxotere (as an example) where the se's just seem so harsh. Not that X is a walk in the park, but not as bad as those seem to be. Ok, to be honest, the main thing is I have my hair on X. I know, I know, vanity is a terrible thing, but I can't help it. Even when my feet were peeling so bad and my DH was like ""are you sure you want to keep trying this one"", I was like heck yeah, my skin can fall off all it wants, as long as my hair stays put!! How crazy is that?! Kathy: My onc is sorta that way. We do scans at regular intervals UNLESS there are some new se's. Now I'm on an every 2-3 month schedule, but when I was on AI's, it was every 6. However, I think if you are worried and an additional scan would give you peace of mind, then definitely ask for it! I have not started my new routine yet. boss is still on vacation, but I will talk to him when he's back next week. Paperwork with HR should be pretty quick, so I'm hoping that maybe I can start on Friday, 11/4. Jeanie: My onc said we would scan again in December too, so we can have scanxiety together I guess!! I think it does take a couple of months to work. I had my 1st scans 9 weeks after I started, and it showed improvement. If you have only done 2 cycles (6 weeks), then it may indeed be too early to tell. Hate it that you have to wait till December though. I love the fall, but Christmas is my absolute favorite time of year! Like you, I LOVE all the sights, sounds, and smells of the holiday. I go crazy decorating and such!! Blonide: How are you doing today? You started back last Thursday, right? Is fatigue the only se so far? I really really hope this new plan will be easier on you. HUGS!!! Glenna: Thanks, but I don't think I'm ready for disability yet. Heck, the telecommuting 2 days was a hard one for me to swallow, even though I'm really warming up to the idea now. For the most part, I enjoy my job and I need the full salary and benefits as long as I can get it. I'm so glad it worked for you though, and I appreciate your suggestion. Judie: Hope you get good news about your ankle. I can only imagine how difficult this has been for you!! The last couple of days, I've been having bathroom issues. warning TMI coming up!. it's like I can't go, can't go, then when I do, oh man. It's not really diarhhea, but definitely some urgency, if you get my drift. I just worry one of these episodes is going hit during rush hour traffic! And, this is soooo weird about my feet! Ok, this cycle there is hardly any redness or peeling, but are they ever tender!! I bought some socks that are black, but made like athletic socks -- thought I could wear them to work and they would offer more cushion that dress socks. Wrong! They are not soft and it is like I can feel every thread!! Owie! I can't wear them!! How bizarre!!!

"301c3e04-dac1-4e6c-8f78-ca2a43357dd9","I've been on Arimidex for about 18 months and have had a truly miserable time with atrophic vaginitis. It was one of the main reasons I was taking HRT before the BC; I think I'm just pretty sensitive there to a lack of estrogen. I had all the symptoms, including a slightly malodorous discharge. Forget sex; it hurt just to sit in a chair. And it's really easy to mistake it foryeast or bacterial vaginosis. The one OTC product I found that helpedis RepHresh (notReplens), whichworks by correcting vaginal pH. I found it really helps with the odor, burning and itching. I just got a Vagifem Rx today after asking my oncologist about it. I neverasked before because I assumed he wouldn't agree due to thatone study that concluded itraised systemic estrogen levels. I was surprised he has no problem with it, and I am a little worried about it. I'mthinking about switching to tamoxifenbecause of other Arimidex side effects, and from what I've read I'd worry less about the Vagifem with that. In any case, I'm thinking I should have my levels checked periodicallyif I'm going to use it.

I had a terrible time getting moving in the mornings. My boss was great and I worked 10 a.m. until however long I could make it. Usually it was 5 p.m. but not always and when I got home I had no energy left at all. Not for exercise or even cooking dinner.

Now they're very weird and loose. and some are painful. I didn't stay on top of it and now they're a mess. Dr. Lopez at MDA's Integrative Medicine Center said that I should see a physical or occupational therapist about my neuropathy and painful toenails. He said they would have suggestions about shoes and how to walk(for exercise) when you can't feel your toes. He also said the tiredness should resolve 6 to 12 months after treatment. He looked worried when I burst into tears over that! Some people ice their fingers and toes during chemo. There is a thread on here about how to do that. I figured I was too late for it.

Dr. Lopez at MDA's Integrative Medicine Center said that I should see a physical or occupational therapist about my neuropathy and painful toenails. He said they would have suggestions about shoes and how to walk(for exercise) when you can't feel your toes. He also said the tiredness should resolve 6 to 12 months after treatment. He looked worried when I burst into tears over that! Some people ice their fingers and toes during chemo. There is a thread on here about how to do that. I figured I was too late for it.

I had a terrible time getting moving in the mornings. My boss was great and I worked 10 a.m. until however long I could make it. Usually it was 5 p.m. but not always and when I got home I had no energy left at all. Not for exercise or even cooking dinner.

At my last treatment (2 weeks ago) my doctor actually dropped the last dose of a/c because I was handling it so badly. physically and emotionally. I was feeling so awful ALL the time. which didn't help my emotional state! I kept waking up every morning hoping to feel a little better, but I didn't. So she switched me to taxol. For the first week or so after, I had such leg pain I didn't know what to do. but it has faded a little bit. I am really tired. but I don't feel horrible like I did with the a/c. I can function and I almost feel human! But now I am getting a little nervous.

"32fb4748-ce4f-48b2-925b-0549887076e9","I didn't have any restrictions during chemo about being around people. I worked full time during the first chemo (AC), just missed the day of treatment and some half days because of being too tired to work on other days close to treatment. I was so scared in the beginning, I just did what they told me, didn't ask any questions. The first thing they told me to do was see a BS. She told me I needed to get chemo before surgery. She wanted the tumors shrunk first. I think she thought they were bigger than they were because there was a lot of swelling from the biopsy. But I also have one which was under a cm but close to chest wall, so she wanted that to shrink and have more room for surgeryI think. The plan was for surgery after both rounds of chemo were finished. When I had the problem on Taxol (an allergic reaction), the onc said I could get the surgery before continuing on chemo or go to a new chemo (Taxotere) and finish that before surgery. She said there was no difference medically. I chose to finish the chemo first. I just want it over with and get my hair back. If I would have been offered this at the beginning, I probably would have had the surgery in between because like you I really wanted the cancer out. I still do, but I really want to finish chemo and get that overwith and get my hair back too. Also as far as surgery goes, the BS said it had to be a MX because of the different breast quadrants involved. And I need radiation because of the lymph nodes and the chest wall. Because of that, the PS said the only option for reconstruction for me is DIEP. I could try implants, but because of needing radiation, the PS said they would have a 60% chance of failing. I'm supposed to get immediate reconstruction with the MX on Aug. 17. Your situation may be totally different. Those were my options though. Not sure what hospital you're going to for treatment, but I'm going to HUP. I really like it there. The doctors are really caring, reallly attentive and really know what they're doing. I like the Onc, the BS, and the PS. The facility is very new and nice. All the chemo rooms are private with a tv and a couple extra chairs for people with you. Most of them have large windows with nice views. I don't know how much of a difference that makes, but I am happy with it. Again, if I can give any other info, just pm me. I've been helped tremendously by the ladies on this site and if I can do the same for someone else, I'd love it.

I have my second tx on Monday. Next week, I am going to try to drink more water and really attack the pain from the beginning so it doesn't get so bad. I also may stay home and rest a little more and see if that helps. I don't look forward to the treatment but it will good to say I am halfway through the Taxol! Terry, hope you do well on Monday. I did not have any allergic reaction which was good. Hope you are the same. It is sunny and 75 degrees today; very nice!!

I found her by looking in the directory of my insurance web page. She is ""in network"". I looked at a few people, read their online profiles and called a few of them up to talk on the phone before making a decision. She is a licensed family therapist. I spoke to her over the phone and liked her before making an appointment with her; she was smart, compassionate, and seemed to understand me. She was not in a rush to get off the phone but wanted to gather some basic information about me. Those are qualities you should find in a good therapist. She has experience with breast cancer survivors, but a therapist will be able to help you in all areas of you life because it is all connected. I encourage you to try this. You write about feeling overwhelmed and need someone who is completely on your side and can help you navigate through all this tough crap so that you can take more time for yourself and your healing. Which you so deserve. Please private message me if you want to. Anyhow, found out today that I have the BRCA2 gene mutation. So. And I told my onco doc that I wanted to stop Taxol because of the neuropathy. I have a total of 4 treatments. So. I will have to have another bone scan to see if the spot on my rib is gone. I am learning to let go of my fear. I want to live fully each day whatever that means to me in the moment. Right now, that means having a chocolate Haagan Daas ice cream bar and taking Otis for a walk on this beautiful spring day. I hope everyone continues to heal (I had thrush too, Jenn. That wan NOT pleasant.) For those of you having a much better time with Taxol infusions I am really happy for you. Especially for those that suffered on A/C. Gives me hope of feeling better again.

I had minimal mouth issues ( mouth sores) and minimal nail damage ( just nail indentions and slight yellow discoloration and a little easier to chip). With that being said, I can't say for sure if the icing helped but I can tell you that it made me feel like I was doing something to help myself during my time in chemoland and wasn't sitting there feeling helpless. Yes, doing those things keep my mind off of the infusion itself and made me focus on something else. I would think that the icing /coldness reduces the blood circulation in those areas of the body that are iced/kept cold during the infusions. I did not do cold caps to save my head although i probably could have. Do i think the chemo still got to those iced/cold areas. yes because I still had mouth sores and I still had some nail damage. As for the nails, I know some women did not ice and they did not have any significant nail damage. Others I know, wished that they had because their nails turned dark and they lost them. My onco did check my nails before I started chemo and said it looked like i had pretty good strong nails to begin with. I also made efforts during chemo to take care of my nails by keeping them short, polished with clear nail polish and a light pink clear polish and wore rubber gloves when I washed dishes and cleaned with household cleaning products. I know that I chose to do those things because I wanted to do whatever I could to minimize nail problems. Not everyone does that though; it was just a personal choice I made after reading on these chemo threads about nail damage and ways to help oneself during chemo.","i","infus","190","CC","136","had","sore","144","taxoter","195","7","DT","nail","0","mouth","JJ","2","NNS","mouth","dure","NN","issu","drug-SE","the","NN","FALSE","nail","NNS","NN","NNS","and","sores","NN","VBD","minim","Taxotere","false","2","PRP","NNP","0","false","3","valid","IN","1","123","98","25","131","98","6","44","123","69","131","69"

"36420081-778f-4cf3-847f-605eb3cc41a1","Yensmiles- I did drink icy cold water and sucked on ice during my rounds of chemo and also Iced my fingernails and toe nails during the Taxotere infusion. I had minimal mouth issues ( mouth sores) and minimal nail damage ( just nail indentions and slight yellow discoloration and a little easier to chip). With that being said, I can't say for sure if the icing helped but I can tell you that it made me feel like I was doing something to help myself during my time in chemoland and wasn't sitting there feeling helpless. Yes, doing those things keep my mind off of the infusion itself and made me focus on something else. I would think that the icing /coldness reduces the blood circulation in those areas of the body that are iced/kept cold during the infusions. I did not do cold caps to save my head although i probably could have. Do i think the chemo still got to those iced/cold areas. yes because I still had mouth sores and I still had some nail damage.

They gave meEmend the first morning and then each day for the three days after plus two other antinausea drugs. I didn't feel like being sick just felt a bit sqeamish. The good thing about it compared to taxol is that after the 3-4 daysof having those side effects they went and I felt great for two weeks until the next treatment butwith taxol although I feel tired which seems to be all the time, my neuropathy has not gone at all and is affecting my home life and working life big time. Plus I have had chronic thrush both ends and a horrible itchy rash on my hands and arms which drive me crazy as soon as I get into my warm bed, plusheartburn. So what would I prefer, the AC chemo I think, because I would know I was going to feel better afterday 4although I only just made it through thanks to the girls on here encouraging me because I didn't think I would make it through tothe last one and it was only four, whereas taxol if I had made it/or make it, itwill be 12 ugh. Personally I think all of it is horrible and areal trial for us but when I think back to when they didn't have those nausea/sickness meds those poor people must have really suffered. Most of the ladies on here had some, if not all the side effects that I had so they understood what I was going through and was marvellous especially as mostof you know how I have that phobia about sickness. I truly would not have made it through any of this without these wonderful ladies. If I had just vomited onceI would have said no morechemo.

This was one of the first sites to come up on Google! So, congratulations to swimangel72!!! I hope to be joining you in the ""have been there and finished that"" club after July 21st. My tumour was ER/PR negative Her2+, so there will be no more drugs for me. I'm being followed with digital mammography (booked for July 3) and a second MRI (booked July 15th, following one in February of the ""good"" breast that caused a bit of concern and needs to be repeated). Did anyone find out how long the Herceptin stays with us? It seems to me that some side effects from the chemo (TCH) which I finished in September are still with me. Hair is horrible - curly and short looks weird on my face! But hey! It's hair!! Hope all are well!

It was suggested by my holistic breast doc to combat Tamoxifen joint pain but I ran it by MO first of course. He said studies are all over the place about it just like they are about soy. My dad's best friend is a very well known MO in another state (which is why he's not my MO!) and he thinks small amounts of soy are fine. My MO told me he didn't even want me near it! So different opinions. one day we'll get to the bottom of these things. In the meantime, there is enough evidence out there that says it actually improves the efficacy of Tamoxifen and all I really care about is that it helps me sleep at night!

The oncologist I have now is the better of the three I've seen but that is not saying anything great about any of them. He gave me the clean exam/no findings in June and then at the annual mammogram, suddenly the radiologist is all concerned and multiple views taken, then an ultra sound, and 2 days later a horribly painful stereotactic biopsy that left me with a hematoma the size of a pool ball. All that upset and it was actually normal. I cannot bare to go through this every six months. I cannot submit to biopsy after biopsy for years on end. They have never found anything on the physical exam, only with the mammogram. I do NOT get any feeling of reassurance when I see the oncologist. I come away depressed and mad. He doesn't want to hear about my continuing pain and side effects from Tamoxifen. He doesn't care that my hair is falling out and that is really disturbing to me. I'm trained as a Medical Technologist and I have no desire to EVER be in an office that says Hematology and Oncology on the sign. What are they going to do to me if I don't go back? Aren't there ever patients that say they can't handle it any longer and just punt? The worst thing that has ever happened to me in my whole life was this diagnosis and I have been treated the worst by the medical community, which I am part of!

"3b13a14d-bb3d-40e8-be52-0e7cfbd689f1","Hi all - quick precis - dx IDC, stage and grade 2, 2cm tumour,and DCIS Jan 2003. WLE,total axillary resection, ER+, PR not done, HER2-. 6 x FEC, 25 rads and 2 boosters. I had my 5 yrly review with my bc surgeon last week and he wants me to continue with Arimidex, due to the lymph node spread, 4/18 nodes+. However, a recent DEXA bone density scan showed significant reduction in bone density since starting Arimidex 4 yrs ago. I had had a DEXA scan before starting Arimidex, ordered by my gastro as I have Crohn's and a 30+ yr history of steroids, which showed some bone loss, but not as much as the recent one, which I guess is why my surgeon is concerned. My surgeon is referring me to a Professor of Endocrinology for a second opinion as to whether I should continue with Arimidex. I have osteopenia, osteo-arthritis in both hips, hands and feet, and had 2 spontaneous fractures in both feet last summer. Spent a month in a wheelchair and then 3 weeks on crutches - very demoralising. I have been on the bisphosphonate Alendronic Acid for a year, and also twice daily Calcichew/Vit. D tablets. I recently found an article on-line from the New England Journal of Medicine dated May 3, 2007, regarding once yearly infusions of Zoledronic Acid, which has had great success. Hip fractures over a 3 yr period reduced by 41%. My surgeon said these infusions are being done at my hospital but he doesn't know much about them and hence the referral to an Endocrinologist, who has a particular interest in Arimidex side effect/fractures/bone loss. Has anyone on Arimidex been referred to an endocrinologist, and if so, what was the outcome? I am still waiting for my appt but hope it will be soon. Thanks for any insight.

A woman I work with was diagnosed with osteoporosis and her MO said Tamoxifen was the only thing she could do - no AIs. Tamoxifen, as I understand it, actually can help the osteoporosis. I too started my Arimidex and then started my radiation. I had major side effects - the normal bone pain, etc but what I could not deal with was the spike in my BP and my heart was racing. I had to stop it. Within 2 days after stopping it my BP went back to normal. My pulse continued to race until a few days after I was done with radiation. My MO said rads likely not the culprit and probably the Arimidex. After all the symptoms from the Arimidex were gone and I was done with rads, the bone pain came back in full force. I called my MO and he suggested I see the rheumatologist to be sure that Arimidex did not cause a rheumatalogic condition to finally surface (they have tested me for several years but nothing has shown up). If it wasn't RA, he said it could well be the Arimidex and explained that the enzyme that Arimidex generates (not sure if I am using his terminology correctly) can stay in the system a long time. Usually when it is gone, the pains are gone. But some people have it stay longer than others. The rheumatologist said not RA. He said he gets lots of referrals for people that are on or have been on Arimidex. A couple of interesting things to note. He said because I had both bone and joint pain, it is probably still the Arimidex (I am 8 weeks post Arimidex). I had a total hysterectomy in 2003 and have been on HRT until my diagnosis of BC in May. He said that HRT helps osteoporsis - keeps the symptoms down and minimizes its progression. He pointed out that I had a double whammy. First, I stopped HRT. SO osteoarthritis was going to get worse. THEN I was taking an AI which also aggravates osteoarthritis as my joints were not getting the estrogen they wanted. So, no wonder I was having pain. Since I tolerate ibuprofen I can increase that if I need to. Flexeril will work (muscle relaxer) but it makes me so drowsy. He suggested cutting it in quarters. I still have not started the Aromasin.

A woman I work with was diagnosed with osteoporosis and her MO said Tamoxifen was the only thing she could do - no AIs. Tamoxifen, as I understand it, actually can help the osteoporosis. I too started my Arimidex and then started my radiation. I had major side effects - the normal bone pain, etc but what I could not deal with was the spike in my BP and my heart was racing. I had to stop it. Within 2 days after stopping it my BP went back to normal. My pulse continued to race until a few days after I was done with radiation. My MO said rads likely not the culprit and probably the Arimidex. After all the symptoms from the Arimidex were gone and I was done with rads, the bone pain came back in full force. I called my MO and he suggested I see the rheumatologist to be sure that Arimidex did not cause a rheumatalogic condition to finally surface (they have tested me for several years but nothing has shown up). If it wasn't RA, he said it could well be the Arimidex and explained that the enzyme that Arimidex generates (not sure if I am using his terminology correctly) can stay in the system a long time. Usually when it is gone, the pains are gone. But some people have it stay longer than others. The rheumatologist said not RA. He said he gets lots of referrals for people that are on or have been on Arimidex. A couple of interesting things to note. He said because I had both bone and joint pain, it is probably still the Arimidex (I am 8 weeks post Arimidex). I had a total hysterectomy in 2003 and have been on HRT until my diagnosis of BC in May. He said that HRT helps osteoporsis - keeps the symptoms down and minimizes its progression. He pointed out that I had a double whammy. First, I stopped HRT. SO osteoarthritis was going to get worse. THEN I was taking an AI which also aggravates osteoarthritis as my joints were not getting the estrogen they wanted. So, no wonder I was having pain. Since I tolerate ibuprofen I can increase that if I need to. Flexeril will work (muscle relaxer) but it makes me so drowsy. He suggested cutting it in quarters. I still have not started the Aromasin.

I too am on 4 rounds of dose dense A/C followed by 4 rounds of Taxatere (in the Taxol family), I started on Aug 5th. I look forward to hearing about your progess. So far the SE have been managable. Fatigue, one small mouth sore and some nausea. Overall I think I barrelled through the first round ok. Gearing up for second round on the 19th. Will be thinking of you on Monday. As for drs dismissing our concerns I too had the same treatment from my OB/GYN. Went in on May 7th with my concerns of a hardening right breast to which I was told this is ""normal"" post breastfeeding (my son ws 11 months). I have BC in my family and she did not think this was of concern. Well 6 weeks later at my follow-up the breast was definitely not ""normal"". The nipple by then was being pulled down, there was dimpling and the mass had grown significantly. I know I should have pushed to have a biopsy back in May but I guess I wanted to hear everything was normal and took that at face value. I know in my heart 6 weeks did not change my dx, but I am a little pissy she just dimssed it. And to boot, I got a bill from her office yesterday. Really - I'm paying for your incompetence. Anyhoo. It is what it is. Thinking of everyone gearing up for chemo, resting after their treatments and anywhere in between.

That's an option available through my medical coverage, but even if yours doesn't include that, there may be a group near you sponsored by others, e.g. the American Cancer Society or local cancer-related organizations. I've been to three meetings so far, and really found it helpful. I also talked with one of the priests at my church before my surgery, about weird thoughts I was having. (I am really going to ask for part of my body to be cut off, how crazy is that?) He really knew where I was coming from, as he is an amputee himself. Or you may be able to see a counselor or social worker either through your health coverage, or with some employers, through an employee assistance program. The doctor who prescribed the Welbutrin may also be able to suggest some resources to you. Hope that helps. A second thought. have you looked into naturopathy at all? There are herbal remedies for depression/anxiety, and maybe some of them don't conflict with tamoxifen.

I hope that the 3 day is a lot of fun. Tamoxifen is a whole different ballgame huh??? While chemo physically kicks your butt the tamox is the emotional equivilent!!! Add to that all the other stuff that comes with it. eyes, joints, HORRIBLE hot flashes. I have also been so much more emotional since the tamox began. I know that people mean well but if i hear ONE MORE TIME that my hairstyle is ""so chic"" I think I'm, going to PUKE!!! Calli was admitted to the hospital for iv nutrition as she lost about 17 lbs last week due to the horrible nausea. She also has mouth sores that they are having to address and if they can build her strength back up surgery next week. Juli- I hope you enjoy your trip and I am so glad the stinging stayed at home.

I hope that the 3 day is a lot of fun. Tamoxifen is a whole different ballgame huh??? While chemo physically kicks your butt the tamox is the emotional equivilent!!! Add to that all the other stuff that comes with it. eyes, joints, HORRIBLE hot flashes. I have also been so much more emotional since the tamox began. I know that people mean well but if i hear ONE MORE TIME that my hairstyle is ""so chic"" I think I'm, going to PUKE!!! Calli was admitted to the hospital for iv nutrition as she lost about 17 lbs last week due to the horrible nausea.

Did your MO offer an antibiotic to rule out infection? Do you maybe want to post on a lymphedema thread? Maybe someone there can give you some direction. Also, Rmlulu on this thread has posted about her truncal lymphedema, maybe a PM? Whatever is going on, it does seem to be getting worse and if it were my issue, I guess I'd be not only scheduling a visit with a lymphedema therapist, but also squeezing myself into my breast surgeon's schedule this very next week--he's officially the breast specialist and, as your MO has not figured out exactly what is happening, that responsibility seems to fall right in his lap. Oh, and I have a little edema myself, in my breast. To date, none of my docs has mentioned it, not even a peep. When, shortly after surgery, I had cording, nobody mentioned that either, just told me my range of motion (somewhat impeded by the cording) was fine.

"3ec86e36-281b-44a7-b5a6-fa93d10758b9","@Donna: I take steroids (Decadron) 12 hours before treatment and again 6 hours before. My appointments are every Monday at 9am. So at 9pm I take my first pill dose and sleep until my alarm goes off at 3am for the second dose. At this point, I find, the previous dose has hit my system and good luck sleeping again. I leave for the hospital at 5am so it's not that bad to get up and putter for awhile. My drive to the hospital is a couple of hours so I'm wired and talking to my ride. At the hospital, my iv is set up with three pre-med drugs before the Taxol: Zantac (which yesterday did wonders on my nauseated stomach), benedryl (my sleepy time) and then ANOTHER hit of decadron. This is all because I had an allergic reaction to the Taxol the first time it was injected. And at this point I find I am HUNGRY! Like as in, ""Back off! Get your own sandwich!"" kind of hungry :) I am fine the rest of the day. I don't find myself overly eating but awake and alert. Around bedtime, though, I was finding it difficult to get to sleep. Last week my doctor gave me Zopiclone. I cut the pills in half and take only half on Mondays and Tuesdays before the steroids leave the system and I find this to be a great help! Other side effects I noticed from the Decadron: water rentention and the first week my skin broke out waaaay worse than it ever did as a teenager!!

My husband said it was because he basted the turkey with a neutrophil solution! So like Rae and Belle I got a vist to the ""Chemo spa"". Chemo went better than last time. No trip to the ER (YEAH!!!) but still a really nasty headache. They gave me extra dexamethasone at the end so I had not gotten up from the chair before it started. The nurse asked me if it was a sinus headache (which it was) and she told me the C in the FEC gave sinus congestion and headache as a SE. So we went and got sudafed before we left the hospital and I think it helped. The Emend I took an hour before the treatment helped also. I still had an unpleasant night (laid in bed with cold packs and cold cloth all over my face) and almost threw up when I tried to eat some Basmati rice BUT I DID NOT throw up! YEAH!!! I used to get excited about going out for lunch now I get excited about now tossing my cookies. Oh how I have fallen. Lee Ann - your deer shot was hilarious. I am glad that there are so many people on this board with such great senses of humor (I still laugh about your dog story and your halloween costume Kimberly!). Rae - I could send him over. He has always been the one to do the more adventurous recipes in the house. I am not a very good cook. In fact I would go so far as to say that I can be a dangerous cook. I once started a fire in my oven with stupid chinese egg noodle. It was at a christmas gathering and I was trying to impress my brother-in-law's girlfriend with my salad making abilities. It did not work. I keep thinking what is so hard about this - a recipe is kind of like a science experiment, do what it says and it should work.

It sounds like you had a great reply to her and at least you know to keep a wide berth from her next time as she appears to be so supportive of you decisions and all you are going through. CJRT - that is great about BRCA the test result. Belle - What patch did the doctor give you that caused all those SE's? Good luck with the hair cutting - but make sure she cuts your hair before she gets too drunk (do not want any nicks on your ear or anythig!). Sarah - I am on day 2 post FEC (same as you). I will also be recieving Nuepegen shots but for 9 days. I was a bit suprised because I was only thinking it would be 5. I sent you a PM a couple of days ago. Now I am DEFINITELY not looking forward to the shots. I was hoping it would not be as bad as the Neulasta.

He has always been the one to do the more adventurous recipes in the house. I am not a very good cook. In fact I would go so far as to say that I can be a dangerous cook. I once started a fire in my oven with stupid chinese egg noodle. It was at a christmas gathering and I was trying to impress my brother-in-law's girlfriend with my salad making abilities. It did not work. I keep thinking what is so hard about this - a recipe is kind of like a science experiment, do what it says and it should work. Sorry to hear that Dalores (Probably not real name, eh) was so rude. It sounds like you had a great reply to her and at least you know to keep a wide berth from her next time as she appears to be so supportive of you decisions and all you are going through. CJRT - that is great about BRCA the test result. Belle - What patch did the doctor give you that caused all those SE's? Good luck with the hair cutting - but make sure she cuts your hair before she gets too drunk (do not want any nicks on your ear or anythig!). Sarah - I am on day 2 post FEC (same as you). I will also be recieving Nuepegen shots but for 9 days. I was a bit suprised because I was only thinking it would be 5. I sent you a PM a couple of days ago. Now I am DEFINITELY not looking forward to the shots. I was hoping it would not be as bad as the Neulasta. I want to go to the corn maze sometime on the weekend but I do not start taking the shots until Saturday night so I should be okay. Can anyone tell me what are ""Limb Alert"" bracelets? Are they like Medic Alert?

"41520360-387d-4f80-a9cb-61ec42968ae1","Dh and I were watching the ""Beyond Tomorrow"" show on the science channel today. (It was episode ""7"", produced in 2005--http://science.discovery.com/fansites/beyondtomorrow/beyondtomorrow.html --sorry, I couldn't find online video). Anyway, they had a segment on the discovery of a ""Miracle Berry"" that contains a substance scientists have named ""MIRACULIN"". This substance is found in the outer coating of the fruit. It can be ingested in its fresh form or taken as a tablet. What it does is ""confuse"" the areas on the tongue that have the taste buds responsible for ""bitter"" and ""sour"", tricking the brain into experiencing bitter or sour substances as sweet. The reporter on the show went to a Miracle Berry cafe where he tried what looked like yummy desserts, except they were made with healthy ingredients. He claimed they were very sour and bitter--not appetizing at all. Then, he ate a berry (which he said tasted rather bitter too) and tried the bitter/sour desserts again. He claimed that the taste had changed and the healthy food tasted very good. Of course, my first thoughts about this Miracle Berry were not along the lines of, ""Wow! I could totally lose weight with those things!"" but more of the ""I wonder if they are doing any clinical trials for cancer patients.""--LOL! Seriously, though. I am wondering if these berries or pills would help someone who is having a hard time eating because chemo has altered the way things taste. The effects of one berry/tablet are said to last about an hour. A quick google search shows that they are available in many countries (including US) and a blister pack of ten runs around $25. I did not find any links about studies involving the berry and chemotherapy in a google search, but I did see numerous blog posts and testimonials saying that cancer patients are using the berries to help with chemo-induced eating problems. Has anyone heard of/tried these things? I know that XELODA has really changed my perception of taste. I had been a PEPSI addict for nearly 20 years before starting XELODA; it suddenly started tasting like potting soil. although I'm not sure why I'd know what potting soil tastes like! I tried some Coca-Cola and found that it now tastes like lemon Pine-Sol (again--not sure how I'd know what that tastes like, but that's what popped into my head! Of course, it's a GOOD thing to not be addicted to PEPSI, but it wasn't fun going through the caffeine withdrawals. I would think that if this Miracle Berry thing really works that it could be a good thing to help with quality of life and keeping up a healthy diet when our treatments are screwing up our taste mechanisms. I know that I really have to force myself to eat lots of the time because of the taste issue. I have plenty of extra weight to lose, but it is certainly better to eat something healthy rather than nothing at all. Here's a wikipedia article about Miracle Berries:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_fruitThe wikipedia article says:Fruit cultivators also report a small demand from cancer patients since the fruit allegedly counteracts a metallic taste in the mouth that may be one of the many side effects of chemotherapy.

"41e6768e-01dd-40df-8770-9ecdee0b40d9","Susan, I did 6 months of navelbine (2 weeks on 1 week off) with herceptin (every 3 weeks). The navelbine is a breeze compared to the first line stuff I had (AC/T). I did have to get a PICC line for the infusions because navelbine can cause some really awful neuropathy when given through normal IV sites.

The navelbine is a breeze compared to the first line stuff I had (AC/T). I did have to get a PICC line for the infusions because navelbine can cause some really awful neuropathy when given through normal IV sites.

"428b4019-d967-4794-8c3f-cf5dc732c324","Hi Puppers:No sense being cute about it. The chemo was bad. And the side effects of the Neulasta shot given after every chemo treatment was even worse. The chemo leaves you with the worst possible metallic taste in your mouth. Hence nothing tastes good, your appetite goes to heck and you have to push yourself to eat and keep nutrition up for immune system. The only thing that tasted OK were sweet foods/liquids like chocolate milk or shakes. I took Booster Protein Plus to get protein in daily. Bad taste lasts about 10 days. I had my last rx on 3/10 and I can still occasionally taste it at every meal. Worst partcame on days 4 through 7. My onc had me on steroids day before, day of and 2 days after chemo. On those days I was feeling great- ready to take on theworld. Had company, ran around shopping, visiting with friends etc./Day 4 brought the steroid crash and chemo side effectsonset. Felt like worst flu ever had so just curled up in bed like a ""chemo queen"". Week two was better. Week three felt great. Then started all over again. But after first rx had 6mg of Neulasta to keep WBC up. On day 5somebody woke me up at 5:00 AM screaming. I quickly realized it was me. I had a sharp twisting pain in my back so horrific that I was crying and screaming. ( I had natural childbirth times 2 without a peep- I don't cry. )It lasted all day then went away the next day. It seems the doctor forgot to tell me that 1 in 5 to 10 women have this terrible bone pain and need pain meds. They dropped the dosage down to 4 mg after that and the terrible bone pain did not occur. I lost my hair on day 21. Very suddenly. Fortunately I had a wig ready, called my daughter and she came and cut what was left of my hair to about 2 inches. I'm not the type to shave my head. It was all gonein days. It still has not started growing back in. My eyebrows have thinned considerably, but I still have enough to fill in with pencil. My lashes have thinned on the bottom. My fingernails(all of them)are showing a line of bluish/whiteness growing out of the nailbeds, consistent with the timeframe growth wise with my first and last chemo rx. I am concerned I may lose them. Will ask med onc tomorrow what he thinks. I met a woman at his office who had Taxol( stronger than Taxotere) who did lose her nails. I'm hopeful mine are only showing signs of the chemo, but I'll hang onto them. If they give you Neulasta 6 mg- ask for a prescription for a pain med. Tylenol did not even touch the pain. I have neuropathy in the toes of both feet. I'm told it should resolve in time. The need to be hyper paranoid about infections is another unpleasant side effect of sorts. No dentist, no vaccines,no manicures or pedicures, wash hands 25 times a day, use Clorox wipes on all surfaces everyday etc., etc. etc. Hardest part was staying away from family, friendsduring times when white count dropped, although I did pretty well. My chemo was during the long, gray winter, so I was lonely a lot. I spent a lot of time emailing friends and writing letters(something I hadn't done in years)and readingto pass the time. My son got me the first 2 seasons of LOST, which I had never seen, and I had fun watching thaat on ""bed"" days. The good news is though that it was only 4 treatments, so tolerable. I'm now looking at 5 weeks of radiation. 5 days a week. Makes the chemo suddenly look like a walk in thepark to me- although it certainly wasn't. I wish you a speedy set of chemo treatments with none of the side effects I had. Keep in touch! And many years of good health!

"452360b8-0e6b-4125-950d-6c709b8b59f9","Hi all, Just finished 2nd Taxol. Had lots of pain with the first one. Joints. mostly hip and knees, some shoulders and elbows too. I am hoping it isn't as bad this time. I am trying stronger pain meds this time. AC was a breeze compared to this. I haven't missed any work all along, but I stayed home one morning 1/2 day just to because of the pain. Anyone done accupuncture for pain? Other suggestions for pain meds? I do go totally bald all the time. I thought having no hair would really bother me, but it doesn't at all. Sometimes the stairs get a little annoying, but most of the time I don't even think about. It is second nature anymore. I did wear a hat to my 10 yr college reunion (mostly to avoid lots of questions, most people know from pictures posted on FB) and I have a wedding coming up that I might wear a scarf too. I don't own a wig, so we'll see what I decide. Congrats to those of you who are done. I am counting the days at this point. Only two more roundsleft! Last chemo Aug. 2 then surgery likely Aug 23 or 24. I meet with the surgeon in two weeks. To get through each one, we try to make chemo fun each time. ""Club Chemo"" as my friend calls. My best girlfriend and sister come each time (my husband comes to the doctors appts but goes back to work) and we have ""guest appearances"" from our other friends! Never a dull moment. I also wear a new outfit each time. I figure if I have to be bald, I may as well be cute doing it. and a little retail therapy never hurts!! Someone commented about me being young and I can't remember. to answer, I am 31. I was actually still breastfeeding my son when I found the lump. I thought it was a clogged milk duct. boy was I wrong!! Anyway, I happen to be a pediatric onc nurse, so unfortunately I know more than I would ever like to about this stuff. But for whoever commented about kids going through this, you are right. They are such an inspiration to me. I figure if they can do this and even worse, I can do it too. I see them go on with their normal lives every day, so that is what I do. Try to live life as normal as possible and deal with SEs on the side. Sorry for the rambling post. not much time to write at home when I am usually chasing a 13 month old around!! I do read all of the posts though and appreciate everyones comments and stories. I find it therapeutic!

My scalp hurt that day. I knew it was going to happen the nurses couldn't believe I held onto as long as I did. I was taking a shower and tons of it fell out into the drain. I just started screaming and crying. I think it was from the shock of knowing I couldn't control it. Then just seeing my self in the mirror half bald half long hair. My Hubby (financee at the time)came home finding me sobbing. Man he was awesome, he just shaved off what was left, the whole time making cute jokes and hugging me.

"45c3c3e1-36e9-4fe2-a2df-972d3462a704","beau, your question is my question. Nobody ever talks about a ""switch"" from an AI to tamoxifen after 2 or 3 years, unless the patient is having trouble on the AI. I've been on Arimidex/anastrozole for more than 3 years (started June 2008), and so far I have only minor problems. Most are things I already had before I started taking Arimidex: v*ginal dryness, minor aches and pains, stiffness -- and, apparently, osteopenia. Many of those I had even before my BC dx. So, my ride on Arimidex has been pretty smooth. But, this switching business has me worried. I was firmly menopausal (5 years) when dx'd with BC, so my med onco said it was a no-brainer to start me on Arimidex instead of tamoxifen. She said she was relieved (she used that word) to not have to deal with tamoxifen, because the SE's with tamox were much more serious and harder to manage than those with an AI. She was referring to thrombosis and uterine cancer from tamox. She considers osteoporosis to be easy to detect (with DEXA) and easy to treat (with bisphosphonates etc.). We had our ""after 5 years"" discussion last spring, and she said my situation was a gray zone. With really small tumors and negative nodes, she does not continue hormonal treatment past 5 years. With larger tumors and/or positive nodes, she does recommend more years on the AI. But, what about me? My tumor was in-between the size ranges she quoted, and it was PR-, which confers greater risk of recurrence than ER+ PR+ would. (ER+ PR- might even be ""Luminal B"", according to something I read last week.) My onco said she didn't know what to do with me after 5 years, but, fortunately, I still had 2 years to go before we had to decide. I have never seen data showing that the sequence of AI-then-tamoxifen, switching at 2 or 3 years, was as effective against BC recurrence as the reverse sequence or an AI alone. IIRC, the AI-then-tamoxifen switching sequence was dropped from the ATAC trial, or at least from the analysis, because it didn't prevent recurrence as well as staying on the AI. (I need to check on that to be sure, because I haven't read that study in awhile. )So, for those of us who started out on an AI up-front, . we're caught, I guess. It was the thing to do, just 3 years ago; and now, it seems we should have been on tamoxifen for those 3 years instead.<sigh> The only comforting thing about all this is that the numbers are really small. According to the article kira quoted, ""In absolute terms, 4.2% of patients using aromatase inhibitors and 3.4% of patients in the tamoxifen group experienced a cardiovascular event."" The authors speculated that the difference would be most important in women with pre-existing cardiac problems (""baseline ischemic heart disease""). There was no difference in the risk of strokes (""cerebrovascular events""); and the risks of blood clots (venous thrombosis) and uterine cancer were, as usual, significantly greater on tamoxifen than with an AI. As for the Luminal A vs. Luminal B stuff. I don't know what my Ki-67 score was, because it wasn't done by the path lab at my cancer center.

"46acf37e-b3b8-4d38-a15f-75388beee440","Omaz Sorry to hear that the neuropathy is ""significant"" but hopefully your onc will have a solution or plan since I think that is a relatively common SE. Calamtykel Interesting that the Benadryl is helping with your pains. Hopefully the pain will subside soon but in the grand scheme of things Benadryl is not so bad if you end up needing to take it for a few days after each treatment to manage the pain. Zenith Due to the severity of my allergic reaction to Taxotere my onc was not even willing to try Taxol but has suggested Abraxane. I still have one more AC to go before moving on to the Abraxane. So that is one possibility if you end up allergic to Taxotere as well. Sweeney I had the beginnings of a mouth sore last week and when I saw my onc he recommended a rinse of baking soda and water or salt and water 3 or 4 times a day. I have seen here on the boards ladies recommending a rinse with both baking soda and salt in water. Biotene is also good (recommended by my dentist) and I have also heard that there is some sort of prescription mouthwash you can get from your onc if none of that helps. Costs This is so interesting! Are you ladies getting your treatments at a hospital or a doctor's office? Mine is done at my onc's office, totally separate from our local hospital. Anyway, I have only gotten bills from them for my co-pays ($25 each visit, they never collect it when I am there like all my other doctors do) but I get monthly statements from my health insurance that say how much they get billed and how much they actually pay. Perhaps all of you US gals know this, but for our Canadian friends - doctors offices have contracts with various insurance companies that set the rates of how much will be paid for specific services (usually quite a bit less than the stated charge) and what the patient's co-pay will be and then the rest is somehow magically waved away. My statement says that my first AC chemo was billed at $1,180.08 and my insurance company paid $588.18. I paid my usual $25 co-pay for the doctor visit and due to having already met my deductible and out-of-pocket maximums, I don't owe anything else for that treatment. I think part of it also has to do with AC having been around a lot longer and as with most drugs, they have gotten cheaper over time. When I had the Taxotere I did get a bill from my prescription drug provider for a $50 co-pay and also a $25 co-pay for each month's worth of Herceptin but my onc's office said something about the AC doesn't need to be ordered from my prescription drug plan so I don't have co-pays for that.

"46acf37e-b3b8-4d38-a15f-75388beee440","Omaz Sorry to hear that the neuropathy is ""significant"" but hopefully your onc will have a solution or plan since I think that is a relatively common SE. Calamtykel Interesting that the Benadryl is helping with your pains. Hopefully the pain will subside soon but in the grand scheme of things Benadryl is not so bad if you end up needing to take it for a few days after each treatment to manage the pain. Zenith Due to the severity of my allergic reaction to Taxotere my onc was not even willing to try Taxol but has suggested Abraxane. I still have one more AC to go before moving on to the Abraxane. So that is one possibility if you end up allergic to Taxotere as well. Sweeney I had the beginnings of a mouth sore last week and when I saw my onc he recommended a rinse of baking soda and water or salt and water 3 or 4 times a day. I have seen here on the boards ladies recommending a rinse with both baking soda and salt in water. Biotene is also good (recommended by my dentist) and I have also heard that there is some sort of prescription mouthwash you can get from your onc if none of that helps. Costs This is so interesting! Are you ladies getting your treatments at a hospital or a doctor's office? Mine is done at my onc's office, totally separate from our local hospital. Anyway, I have only gotten bills from them for my co-pays ($25 each visit, they never collect it when I am there like all my other doctors do) but I get monthly statements from my health insurance that say how much they get billed and how much they actually pay. Perhaps all of you US gals know this, but for our Canadian friends - doctors offices have contracts with various insurance companies that set the rates of how much will be paid for specific services (usually quite a bit less than the stated charge) and what the patient's co-pay will be and then the rest is somehow magically waved away. My statement says that my first AC chemo was billed at $1,180.08 and my insurance company paid $588.18. I paid my usual $25 co-pay for the doctor visit and due to having already met my deductible and out-of-pocket maximums, I don't owe anything else for that treatment.

When I had the Taxotere I did get a bill from my prescription drug provider for a $50 co-pay and also a $25 co-pay for each month's worth of Herceptin but my onc's office said something about the AC doesn't need to be ordered from my prescription drug plan so I don't have co-pays for that.

"46ca542e-c76c-4034-a257-efcf34529379","Beachbum102 Thanks for the positive report. I have arthritis in my knees and have discovered that the recumbent bike at the gym is much easier on them than the treadmill. In this warmer weather half of the year, I go to the local pool and walk up and down, do exercises and ""bicycle"" in the water. There is a therapeutic pool kept nice and warm open during adult swim which I use for the last part. The only trouble is I should do more weight bearing exercise because of the risk of osteoporosis from the Anastrozole I am taking. I do chair yoga at the senior center and that helps with my arm which has some lymphodema risk. That leader does Livestrong at the Y and she has lots of good tips. I look forward to learning what strength training machines I can use and keeping motivated as the days get dark and cold. You don't list that you take an AI because one potential side effect is weight gain. I have used an app called Lose It to record my eating and exercise and help me stay within a calorie range. Has helped me. Mqt64 I was a great stress eater when working and then caring for an aging parent. BC has coincided with a time when I can focus on myself with much that was stressful gone. But I waited til after surgery and radiation were over to make most changes. It is a daily struggle to give up my sweets and find other ways to deal with life's curveballs. Let your body heal from your current situation and then you may feel ready to work on weight loss. You have a lot of inner strength to draw on.","one","becaus","888","NULL","848","potenti","weight","850","ai","899","6","DT","you","0","is","NULL","2","NN","side","take","VBZ","effect","drug-SE","an","NN","FALSE","NULL","PRP","NULL","NN","NULL","weight gain","IN","JJ","NULL","AI","false","1","CD","NNP","0","false","3","valid","VBP","8","63","9","80","80","80","8","25","53","1","131","8"

I think that is the kiss of problems to come. I have been the oddball through all of this BC stuff. I had a huge hematoma after surgery, I had a collapsed lung from port placement, and I had horrible SE's with taxol and still have pretty bad neuropathy.

"485da202-87ea-4e71-9d4b-7325f62ba431","Thought I would add my two cents on what is working for me PFC 3 years. There is no question my hair came back finer, thinner especially a bit on top, with less body, and with receding hairline with Taxotere. I have a theory: it is harder on fine hair, as the areas I had baby hair fine hair, like at the temple were really burned out. My eyebrows and eyelashes did not recover, but I have some pointers. I have tried every brow pencil and liner under the sun. I find for medium brown folks, the Tarte waterproof line is the best. The Anastasia powders are too ash for me, and the Tarte pencil is very natural looking. I also have been using Biosil for one month, an Himalaya Herbals hair fall shampoo. I looked at photos from just a month ago, and the growth is significantly more than I've experienced in earlier months. Tamoxifen basically means I only need a haircut every six months! But with this new combo, I think we are good, at least better. I'm still a bit disappointed, but overall happy I have hair. I am going to take the Biosil up to 5 drops 2x a day, I was only taking 1 pill to see if that made a difference (and it did, but I might have even more dramatic results with the 5 drops). I've done research on Biosil. There are questions about whether we should use Silica long-term. Biosil is not silica, it seems like it's safe for the long haul. I do try to separate my Tamoxifen from my vitamins, as it appears some can block Tamoxifen's efficacy.","have","i","324","NULL","199","a","burn","207","taxoter","335","25","IN","reced","0","realli","NULL","1","VBD","templ","hairlin","RB","were","drug-SE","with","NN","FALSE","NULL","VBG","NULL","VBN","NULL","burned out.","PRP","DT","NULL","Taxotere","false","2","VBP","NNP","0","false","4","valid","NN","8","98","137","80","80","80","44","44","25","137","123","44"

My story is a long one as it's been almost 6 years since I started my treatments back in 2007. I too had Taxol and it really took a toll on me. Severe muscle and joint pain along with theneuropathy and I hate to say this but it's never gotten better. I wake up every morning and can barely move, from tingling in my feet to the joint pain in my hips and also my elbows! I walk quite a bit but can only get about 1.5-2 miles in before the pain gets really bad in my hips (this is after taking 2 aleve just to get a walk in at all!) I've had MRI's, nerve tests, PT, etc. and nothing has been determined, it's so frustrating. I've recently moved to AZ from New England and I'm in the midst of finding all new doctors. I'm lucky to have the Mayo clinic out here so I am hoping that I can find a doctor that will finally tell me that all of this pain is linked to long term side effects of Taxol. I'm only 47 for gods sake, not 87 but I feel it every day! I'm anxious to see what you find out AustinGal so I'll be back to check in on you. Good luck!

"4af6426a-8b3a-43dd-bc14-b74f6a132291","On my1st TC they were worried about me reacting to the Taxotore, so gave me all the IV steriods etc and did the infusion very slowly gradually increasing the dose. I did fine. On the 2nd they just started the Taxotere full speed (one hour infusion) well, it wasn't even a minute and I was red, seeings spots, spine painand having a hard time breathing. They did more meds a saline flush and restarted it at the slower speed (3 hours infusion.) Yesterday was my 3rd and they did the 3 hour infusion and I was fine. So, slowing down the infusion makesa huge difference. I have the stupid eye twich and runny nose. Both annoying! Yesterday the onco said he wants to remove more lymph nodes after chemo just to check they out. I had ITCs in one lymph node (not mets, Still node negative. )2nd node was clear. Then I met when the radation onco andhedisagreed, sayingmore nodes wouldn't show anything after chemo and especially sinceI only had ITC's in one node not the other. He says the chemo has alreadytreated systemic andI'mdoing radiation (even though I had a BMX, my margins were clear, butthe onco still wanted radiationto be safe)The radiation oncofelt that if theywanted to take my nodes, they should have done it before chemo. I did ask if they could dotake the lymph nodes before my4th treatment and they said no, because of risk of infection. etc. I'm really confused, hubby thinks the radationonco is right.

I have also finished 27 rounds and have just 1 more round tomorrow and then the final 5 boosts. It is very exciting to be so close to the end, but it is also full of fear and anxiety that this daily treatment is coming to a close. Like you Sandra, I had very minimal side effects from the rads. Nothing a little aquaphor, calendula, aloe and hydrocortisone couldn't handle :P It surprised me though how the skin holds up for so long and then suddenly it becomes angry. Nicole, I started Tamoxifen about 6 weeks ago and it is going well with minimal SE. The first couple of weeks I experienced pain in my thighs (like I was tackled in a game of football from both sides) but that went away and other than hot flashes, no other SE's have appeared.

"4c26380d-1235-4ffa-ae37-6bc36aa8ad24","Hi Hannariggs, Iamalso experiencingthe same stabbingpain at breast where the wound is. I had a lumpectomy three months ago. Glad that I am ""normal"", I was thinking too, if it is the cancer. Congrats Rambo(Lynn)! Yeah. that's a milestone, last AC. Thanks for sharing some good news in your family. Hi 2bluestars, please do update on after your 1st DD Taxol. I am one of them who has just started with my 12 weekly Taxol. Hi Karkar06, hello and it is not great to meet you here but we have each other in the same time zone. My 1/12 weekly started on 2 Sept. I am having the tingling feeling on finger tips and toe tips. Is that neuropathy? My two thumb nails have stripes of black now. I am worried that nails will start to fall off? So far I still my lashes and browsafter my 4 rounds of AC. Read that they will drop with the weekly taxol :( As if it is not already bad to have a bald head. Hi Mellie, I amalso on pills. I told myself. eat whatever pills, just to get over this ordeal and be well again. The only thing is I havehigh anxiety issues. And I will start pacing at night. Sometimes I feel that my heart is going to jump out from my mouth. And for umpteen times, Icry and cry since my diagnosis. Hi Dreadlx, my heart aches for you. You are a brave one! Hang in there strong ok. We are all with you. Its already so difficult, please do update us here. The support here is great! I often do feel better reading. Hi Hannariggs, Lark and Angela, are we on the sametreatment regime? As mentioned, I have just started my first session of taxol on 2 Sept (Mon). Another 11 to go.

"4c413e09-d3df-476c-a442-f5d72ab57d90","Thanks, Rosemary. I have actually cut out all the supliments I added to get me through my move last summer. Am down to my ordinary basics--things like C, D. Cal. Mag,(Quercetin)that I've taken forever, way before bc. I eat a lot of healing & beneficial foods-the winter squashes are marvellous for us now & full of leutine & A vitamin. Bitter greens will always be great too. I recently met a naturopath friend of mine(at WF of course). I asked his take on juicing to heal SEs from AI (not just the crippled thing, but my labs ofhigher lipids and glucose).^^^^^^^^And he definately feels I will raise my glucose higher by juicing fruit^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ (Susie, please note this before juicing apples and pineapples!! )To me, this is what makes suppliments more acceptable. Ari likes the powdered formulations, particularly the ""green drinks"", which, IHO are as effective as juicing. I on other hand, dislike green drinks immensely. I wont even eat quinoa--taste is too green for me. So this is why I stick to my basic suppliments, and eat plenty of fruit & vegs. Rosemary, I'm the girl who even begged my surgeon to IV me vitamin C in hospital. (He told me to sneak the caps in. I take 3 500 mg a day)And I was truely afraid after yonks of taking them, I'd get scurvey if I stopped suddenly! The femara SEs have progressed to gigantic arthritic pains in my fingers, and in my whole thumb joint of my palm. Cant open stuff, cant grip anything w/out bigtime pain. I am a mass of joint pain, and as you know, the SEs (mine anyway) keep getting worse! At this point I cant do stairs w/out hauling myself by bannister. and my hands kill when I do! My onc, when I saw him in Sept, suggested I try Arimidex. But I'm afraid to trade the devil I know for the devil I dont. One friend also experiences bad edema from femara, but experienced edema in her surgery arm on armidex, as well. Like lymphedema gearing up? This scared the hell out of both of us & we're staying w/femara. ALTHOUGH it is winter now. And I probably woudl rue quitting AI w/out at least TRYING arimidex. What if it was perfect for me?

What if I can't get any more chemo? How will this affect the effectivity of my treatment? How much will it decrease my odds of surviving? . and the only thing the oncologist would do is shrug his shoulders and roll his eyes (he's not my onc anymore). So silly me, here I am about to give you another question . would it be possible to have Abraxane instead of Taxol? I hadAbraxane because of my allergic reactions. The side effects of Abraxane say that neuropathy can ""occur often and usually improve without medication within a month of interrupting treatment (average 22 days for severe side effects)."" . I know you and perhaps your onc would be willing to continue with the neuropathy if it wasn't permanent. I know the other ladies on here will chime in any time (provided they haven't already while I've been typing this) and provide even more advice! Good luck and my prayers are with you.","hadabraxan","i","796","MD","703","becaus","neuropathi","708","taxol","806","14","IN","abraxan","2","that","VB","9","VBP","abraxan","instead","DT","say","drug-SE","of","NNP","FALSE","often","NNP","RB","NN","can","neuropathy","PRP","IN","occur","Taxol","false","3","NN","NNP","1","false","12","invalid","RB","8","47","6","8","131","8","44","-1","8","6","44","8"
"4dc3a14e-6ac9-412c-8c3a-25b6f350abe9","Hey Ladies, I may not be doing this right. not the best computer person. A little older than most of you but boy do I fit in with those of you that want that cold beer Mmmmmmm or red wine or white, doesnt really matter to me. I turned 48 last month and was diagnosed a year ago April 1st (no foolin) April fools day used to be one of my most enjoyed prankster days. not anymore. Stage 3a with 8/20 lymph nodes. I was so consumed by what needed to be done for my only son's graduation party that I never asked many questions or did research. I had a mastectomy mid April and took off 3 weeks of work. Im a special education aide where I care for a little girl that has down syndrome and PICA (another nasty disorder)The party went well and we had it in the backyard with a huge tent. My family, friends and neighbors were a great help. We did landscaping, painted the exterior of the house and made all the food. Aaaannnndd the beer was soooooo cold and tasty. Chemo started 3 days after graduation. Had 16A/C followed by 12Taxol which took up until Thanksgiving, then I had a break before starting radiation. 28 visites for that at 7 different locations of treatment. Radiation did not treat me well towards the end. There isnt a facility close to where I live so travel time was about 1 1/2 hours each way. very tiring. The best thing was, there was little or NO snow. February I started Tamoxifin daily for 5 years. Hot flashes are crazy BUT every time I have one I tell myself that it is killing the cancer cells and that gets me through it. Two weeks ago I got myself in a horrible funk because a friend of my that was treated for BC at the same time as I was only she opted out of radiation, sadly had her cancer return. I guess is scared the hell out of me and caused me to breakdown (hadnt done that yet, so it was a long time coming). I started to have anxiety attacks and horrible dreams. Spent most nights avoiding going to bed because of the fear. My primary docs nurse suggested the support groups and anti depressent was prescribed. I have not taken it yet but just knowing it is there helps. I do take something occationally for anxiety other than the beer. My onc told me to go ahead and have a few drinks that it was NOT going to harm anything. Just remember that good food (I like the pizza and ice cream thing) and exercise are huge. even when you dont want to. I have to brag a little about my family. There is NO way that I would have gotten through what I have without my husband and son. My parents, sisters, brothers and BRA burning buddies. I love them all. My son got engaged on Valentine's Day to his HS GF of 5 years. No immediate plans for a wedding but I did add it to the bucket list of things to do. Well off to bed I go, had my husband at the doc today and he has full blown pnemonia. Got to med him up and get some sleep. The cows will be bawling come 4:00 and we all have to do our part. keeps me going. Thank you all for lending an ear. Well wishes to everyone. Kiss those babies ""good-night"" no matter the age.","for","daili","1418","VBP","1389","year","hot","1398","tamoxifin","1429","3","VBD","februari","0","year","JJ","13","IN","daili","i","NNS","for","drug-SE","start","JJ","FALSE","but","NNP","NNP","JJ","are","Hot flashes","JJ","NNS","crazi","Tamoxifin","false","1","IN","NNP","0","false","16","valid","PRP","102","44","19","9","145","44","63","9","129","63","9","129"

Also have ostopenia & over sensitive/allergic to many drugs not to mention taking blood pressure meds by the handful to try to keepthe BPout of the stratosphere. I started Aromasin in June, 2010. Onc chose it due to fewer problems with joints. It was fine but had to switch to Anastrozole (Arimidex)in 02/11 due to cost. Yes I have hot flashes but then I have had them for overa decade. Due to cardiac concerns I have not ever taken any medication for them. My life looks like I have a fan fetish as they are in everypossible place I could be in my home and on my desk at work. In the early years they were awful and there were manytimes when I could time them every 20 minutes. Surprisingly I find them much milder over the last year but then again, it has been a decade so not sure if it is the AI's or maybe I have just outlived the worst of it. I do still run a fan directly on me all night. I have found that I have no more joint issues than I already had with the lupus. In the first few months, I had alot of muscle pain and more frequent migraines (a life long problem) but that seems to have settled out over time. I mentioned the fans, I have taken glucosamine/chondroitin for probably 15 yrs which helps the joints and walk regularly. I bought eye masks from Colorado Warming at our state fairthat I keep in the freezer to use with migraines. Just don't put the elastic around your head. You could probably improvise with other cold packs. For me, bright light has always been a major trigger and so I avoid sun as much aspossible (also necesarydue to the lupus)and make sure sunglasses are polarized. I was already using Minoxidil for many yrsbefore the BC. My hair is about thesame thinnessas always. I now have no hair at all on my arms, legs or underarms.

You could probably improvise with other cold packs. For me, bright light has always been a major trigger and so I avoid sun as much aspossible (also necesarydue to the lupus)and make sure sunglasses are polarized. I was already using Minoxidil for many yrsbefore the BC. My hair is about thesame thinnessas always. I now have no hair at all on my arms, legs or underarms. I was really concerned about the AI's but have been pleasantly surprised that it has gone pretty well.

"544d4e8b-d3b8-4d68-8d8d-6ea57eedc990","I gained 20lbs since my dx, 13 of that was after I started Tamoxifen. My MO told me that more women lose weight than gain it after starting Tamoxifen. He's all about statistics! In an effort to prove him wrong I joined a fitness challenge at my gym, increased my workouts (and intensity), joined My Fitness Pal (to log food, exercise, weight), started weighing my food and also got a fitbit to keep track of my steps. Well. in 3 months I lost 20lbs and several inches! I was grossly underestimating my caloric intake and overestimating my caloric burns. I had my exchange 2 weeks ago and was terrified I was going to gain weight again while convalescing. I talked with my GP about my goals and we came up with a plan. I'm continuing to eat better and work out (within limits as I'm recovering still) and am planning to lose another 10lbs to get into my healthy BMI. In all actuality I'm not even concerned with the number, but rather my body fat % and how I look! I had to cut my carbs drastically as I just dont do well with them. I know this next ten pounds will be harder to lose. weight loss is very slow now despite my serious efforts.

"545131f9-f355-43af-80f7-44b99e830ae9","Kayarose and zjrosenthal - I do weekly taxol herceptin. SEs are more annoying than debilitating - achy, headaches, sore nose maybe some nosebleeds, fatigue - generally like you are coming down with the flu but also have a major hangover. Taxol can be hard on the nails and also cause neuropathy. I massage tea tree oil into my cuticles twice a day, use a nail hardener and paint them black to avoid issues. Others ice their fingers and toes during treatment which is also supposed to help with neuropathy. I'm cold capping so no more ice for me. I also take 30 mgs of l glutamine, b6 and b12 which helps ward off neuropathy. Taxol isn't hard. You may even see your hair start to grow back sometime during your treatment.

"549f3413-b023-40c0-b086-1200ded81000","Hi Tara - I haven't had a whit of nausea since I started Taxol/Herceptin. That's not to say it's a total walk in the park as it does tend to give you some muscle pains in places where you might be especially susceptible, but so far I find it a lot easier. I haven't had any icky mouth taste either and no allergic reaction. I do get a little tired the day or two after, but otherwise feel pretty good. Drink lots of water! They say weekly Taxol is easier on the body. Jackie, I'm sorry you have had such a rough time with the Taxol. I haven't really gotten out of breath, but I sure did on the AC. I can't get Nuelasta with the weekly protocol, but my onc says that I can get Nuepogen if my counts start to go down. She didn't say much about how it works compared to the Nuelasta, but I have heard that it isn't as hard on you. Good to know it works well for you, Nash. I'm a little nervous about flying without WBC support. I am running a miniscule fever of 99.5 tonight, so I'm going to keep an eye on that, but otherwise feeling mostly OK.

"55656dbc-e615-4280-957e-82ae56a8bc90","Ladies, I did # 9 of my supposed 12 weekly taxol and called it finished. The neuropathy was at the point the onc wanted to switch me to 4 weeks of taxotere instead with a whole new set of se's for only 4 weeks. (I have not seen where any of you have just had taxotere weekly). I said no to that and did one last taxol and will start the herceptin alone next week. My second opinion onc agreed that this was a reasonable thing to do since it was the herceptin not the chemo that was the big benefit to me since I am stage one. I am sorry I did not get to do them all but not to the point of have permanent nerve damage to feet or hands. I meet with radiation onc on June 10 to plan for radiation that will probably start in July after our week vacation on Lake Michigan. I will continue with the herceptin for balance of one year and have another echocardiogram scheduled in June. I will also be taking an AI of some kind. I will be see onc in June when results of echo are back and will decide about that then. When I see some of the other ladies getting chemo doing whatever they can because they are stage 3 and 4 it made me realize how lucky I am to have a choice and not have to take anything and every thing they want to throw at the cancer  I know he was being conservative, but i have read that 8 or 10 weekly taxol may become the standard not 12. Who knows how many is actually the right number for any particular patient. They just pick a random number when they do the testing and that becomes the standard until someone else proves that less is better. They are doing trials in Finland that are showing that 3 months of herceptin may be as good of result as 12 months. I am glad I had the 2nd opinion , and a friend with me to listen to what the Dr. had to say. She has been thru cancer with a 12 year old son and they had made some decisions along the way that others did not agree with but turned out to be the right ones in the long run. She agreed with my choice today. I am looking forward to getting some energy back. Blood counts were better today and should continue to improve with no more chemo. I made it thru with no neulasta shot and No hair loss only thined, but I think the diabetes and neuropathy made up for that. I am celebrating with those who have finished and wish those of you with more to go very minimum se's Wishing you all the best Annette","call","and","77","VBD","43","it","neuropathi","48","taxol","87","5","JJ","my","0","the","IN","4","VBD","it","suppos","DT","finish","drug-SE","week","PRP","FALSE","the","PRP$","DT","NN","was","neuropathy","CC","PRP","at","taxol","false","2","VBD","NN","0","false","5","valid","VBN","102","123","1","-1","25","1","25","11","44","44","102","1"

I tried ibuprofen and such for the first half of the first day and then decided it was silly to be so miserable and tried 1 half of a hydrocodone, which knocked it right out for the rest of that day. The next day I took half a hydrocodone that morning when I woke up with some pain, and another half that afternoon --- more ""just in case"" than anything else. After that it was just very light aches that I could handle with no pain killers at all. Of course, Monday's treatment may bring me a whole new story but I plan to ask for a new script for hydrocodone just in case, since that was all I had.

Before I became a member of this group I posted all over the support site and got responses from women who were much further along than we are, and they said they liked being ""in treatment."" It made them feel safe, like they were doing something. I took a Zyrtec last night and slept like a log. but it was kind of a drugged, foggy sleep. I think it helped break the pattern. I didn't dream as much as I needed to. I think what is really necessary in sleep is to dream and let your mind drift illogically, which my mind just won't do lately. But I feel very tired and relaxed like I'll get a good sleep tonite w/o drugs. Spent part of the day outside raking and doing spring cleanup which is amazingly exhausting. I kept on having to take breaks from the heat and come down here to the basement to cool off. my hands were trembling very strongly, is this a taxotere SE? After I cooled off the shaking would go away. Mary, I don't know about you but I have no doubt my cancer was the result of taking synthetic hormones. I was really overexposed, (1) to DES in the womb, which my mother said she took by the handful, (2) to lots of infertility hormones in a vain effort to get pregnant, and (3) birth control pills, early and late in life, to control periods (4) HRT up until the time of my dx, which included testerone, estrogen WITHOUT progesterone for a few years (which I found out is a no no). This is good & bad, because I wonder if all I needed to do what get off all the phony hormones to disable the cancer. Skye. I am not very up-to-date so I don't know why you are getting tubes in your eyes at 6 am tomorrow but it probably sounds a lot worse than it is!! Good luck!! Mel.

"5686f20e-4fca-46e4-9bf2-9d88d766c2e4","Hi Gals, Checkin' in for the evening. Most of you are getting close to end of your treatment and on to the next phase, and wondering about the transition. Before I became a member of this group I posted all over the support site and got responses from women who were much further along than we are, and they said they liked being ""in treatment."" It made them feel safe, like they were doing something. I took a Zyrtec last night and slept like a log. but it was kind of a drugged, foggy sleep. I think it helped break the pattern. I didn't dream as much as I needed to. I think what is really necessary in sleep is to dream and let your mind drift illogically, which my mind just won't do lately. But I feel very tired and relaxed like I'll get a good sleep tonite w/o drugs. Spent part of the day outside raking and doing spring cleanup which is amazingly exhausting. I kept on having to take breaks from the heat and come down here to the basement to cool off. my hands were trembling very strongly, is this a taxotere SE? After I cooled off the shaking would go away. Mary, I don't know about you but I have no doubt my cancer was the result of taking synthetic hormones. I was really overexposed, (1) to DES in the womb, which my mother said she took by the handful, (2) to lots of infertility hormones in a vain effort to get pregnant, and (3) birth control pills, early and late in life, to control periods (4) HRT up until the time of my dx, which included testerone, estrogen WITHOUT progesterone for a few years (which I found out is a no no). This is good & bad, because I wonder if all I needed to do what get off all the phony hormones to disable the cancer. Skye. I am not very up-to-date so I don't know why you are getting tubes in your eyes at 6 am tomorrow but it probably sounds a lot worse than it is!! Good luck!! Mel. I do think I need the antidepressants now. I hate to give up my prozac for tamoxifen. Maybe I should consider the AIs, though I hate the thought of dealing with bone loss.

Yesterday was 5 weeks post chemo (or PFC- post f**kin chemo as another thread has so wittily described). So, I am back to work full time and busy with my daughter's wedding which is in one month and 2 days! Like Lisa and the others, I am dealing with the Herceptin nose problems CONSTANTLY (I use aquafor as well) and I do feel kinda flu like a day or two after. My biggest issues are emotional right now. After the high of finishing chemo, I've felt kinda lost. I still have surgery to replace an expander after the wedding but it's more than that. I KNOW that I am not that person I was before diagnosis. I really miss that carefree, happy gal! Have been reading that this all is normal but the one difference is I don't think my low is as cancer related. In other words, I don't feel lost without a kizillion MD appts, nor am I overly worried about reoccurance. I just feel like I've lost something else besides my boobs. I work in the Social Work dept at a University and my co-workers are telling me I'm going through post traumatic stress. I don't poo poo that idea at all. As we all know, we really never have time to process the shock of the diagnosis because before we know it, we are having surgery and then chemo. OH, WHO KNOWS??? I'm just sad that I feel sad! And that IS with Effexor which is a Godsend for hot flashes and has probably prevented me from jumping off a bridge more than once!! I do have hair though! I'll have my DSO take a picture of my head soon. I went to a natural haircolorist and must say that once the white was covered up, I looked positively unbald! I think one of the reasons for that is because I had Abraxane rather than taxotere. Which is really what prompted this long winded post to begin with!! JOURNEY GIRL: I was on the EXACT same protocol you will be on. Abraxane/Carbo/Herceptin every week x 3 with a week off in between for a total of 12 weeks. I was unable at the time to find ANY earlier stagers on this schedule so it's nice to meet someone else doing that. I would be happy to help you with any questions so just pm me if you have any. The advantage of Abraxane is NO steroids which oftentimes is what gives alot of gals trouble. I had to postphone one chemo toward the end due to low platlets.

"577ebee9-deec-48bb-ab8a-e0be563338f1","Professor50--I second the idea of magnesium. My holistic doctor, MO and all 3 of my yoga instructors told me that magnesium would really help with constipation issues and they were right. I have been taking 2 SloMag tablets a day which is only about 150mg of magnesium but also get some in my multi and some foods. Over the summer, i felt my Tamoxifen muscle pain was increasing (which my holistic doc had said the magnesium would help with that as well) so I have upped my intake to about 350mg a day. My doc did say that 350mg of magnesium a day is a pretty standard dose and to start with that and adjust if you have loose stools. My whole life I was one of those people who had a BM maybe two or three times a week but magnesium has put me regular!! Just today, I was thinking how much better I feel! Muscle pain is mostly gone which I credit to the magnesium, ginger and turmeric. Constipation is gone thanks to the magnesium and hot flashes are few and far between and pretty mild thanks to iCool. I was just thinking this morning how good I have been feeling lately so I guess there's hope! And interesting about you losing weight once you quick working out so hard. The nutritionist at my gym told me the same thing. Once I quit stressing about he weight, I started to lose. Granted it's only been about 4 pounds but I'm ok with that! My MO said most of his patients gain around 40 pounds in the first year on Tamoxifen so he's quite happy with me. RobinLK---I've been on Tamoxifen since Feb 2013 and in Jan of this year had a hysterectomy with ovary removal as well. Up until about July I was wondering if it was worth it because of muscle pain, weight issues (not gaining but unable to lose with lots of exercise) and generally feeling poorly. I even had bouts of plantar fasciitis. But just in the last couple of months, I seem to have found my new normal. I exercise, eat decently (most of the time) and use supplements to help with issues. I am still on Tamoxifen but this is pretty close to the best I've ever felt on it. Don't know if it was the hysterectomy or just my body finally adjusting to Tamoxifen.tresjolie2---I was terrified too and now realize there was no reason to be. Even if you have SEs, most can be handled with exerice, diet and supplements. The women who have severe SEs are rare. Breast cancer is sucky enough. Try not to let the Tamoxifen be sucky as well. Keep telling yourself that it's helping to keep you cancer free. And any SEs or questions, just come here and ask. There's a huge number of women here who will help you get through the Tamoxifen days. or suggest alternatives if that's what you need. I've actually finally managed to make my brain ""like"" my Tamoxifen.

I didn't have Adriamycin the first time around so if anyone here had it and remembers any pointers. that would be great! I haven't found anyone who has had Adriamycin for our lovely stage IV. stxmom, I haven't read Radical Remission so maybe I need to. Thanks for the nice message.2nd time, I am saving Kadcyla for the next treatment. I have it is an option now but I am going with Adriamycin and hoping that it works because, as my one of my oncs so wisely put it, my cancer hasn't been exposed to Adriamycin yet. Also, I've already lost my hair so now seems like a good time. Hehe, the things I think of! Sue, yes, it is one step forward and one step back.

I did do chemo and I do have a lot of collateral damage from it and I had to stop Tamoxifen due to psychotic depression. It all sucks :-)However, there are many girls that sail through 'mostly' unscathed. It is a really hard decision and I wish I would have thought about it a bit more. You will get different opinions from everyone, as you are seeing. Gather all of your information and weigh the odds. In the end, you alone have to make peace with your decision either way you go. I hope the mama print and/or second opinion will shed some light for you. And please. 7 - 13% body fat????

My second treat was not to bad. Like you, I have been tired and drained of energy. When I do have some energy I make the best of it! My chemo cockatail is adriamycin and cytoxan. Tomorrow will be my third treatment and in two weeks my last for this combination. Then for next twelve weeks will be taxol. I will go every week for that one. I did lose all my hair and my wig had to be sent back for a alteration. The scarves are more comfortable anyway. My hubby has treated me to a special skin care products made by John Hopkins for chem patients. I can't tell you how much I love the stuff. My skin is so dry and this stuff is amazing.

"5e70a41d-59ac-4103-ba3f-972becf33a81","Lespring-1) As for selecting what day to have your chemo, this may give you an idea. I had my chemo infusions on Tuesdays. I received my Neulasta shot Wednesday afternoon. I felt fine on Wednesdays and Thursday ( probably because of the steroids that keep me very peppy). Friday, I would start to feel not so great and usually spent the day resting. Saturday and Sunday were also down days where I rested and took care of myself. By Monday, I was feeling okay again. You may want to consider getting some summer help with the kids. Don't hesitate to ask for help. You need to remember that you don't have to be ""Super Duper Woman""; Super Woman will do.2) The first round of chemo will last the longer than the other rounds because you are getting acquainted with the the infusion center procedures and your infusions will be run a little slower so that the infusion nurses can monitor you closely for any reaction to the chemo. At the infusion center I had my chemo, I was weighed first and then had my vitals checked ( heart rate, blood pressure, temperature.) Then I would have a blood draw to check to see if my blood counts were okay for to receive chemo. Then there was a waiting period for those results to come out. Once those did, the chemo pharmacy orders were signed and sent to be filled. That meant there was more waiting time. Once the drugs were received, it was time to have my pre-chemo IV drug cocktail ( benedryl, steroid, Ativan). Once that was completed, then it was time for the chemo. The Cytoxan is usually run over a 30-45 minute time period; the Taxotere is run over 1 hour. The slower the drugs are run may help prevent a headache that can occur. I ate breakfast before I went to my infusions so that the pre-chemo IV drugs could be administered. The infusion nurses don't like to give those drugs on empty stomachs since those drugs can cause nausea on their own.3) How you feel on Day 17 is really dependent upon you. That is the week before the next round of chemo. I usually felt pretty good that week. If you are going to a major event with many people, I suggest that you may want to avoid a lot of hugging and kissing, hand shaking and do elbow bumps instead. Even though you may be receiving the Neulasta, you still need to be aware of the people around you who are sick. Your white blood cell count may be in a good range but the last thing you want to do is catch a cold or get sick. As for the hair loss, everyone is different. My hair started thinning after Day 14. I didn't buzz/shave my head and just let happen what was to happen.4) I didn't have rads. I may be one of the few here that didn't have rads.5) Neulasta shot- I started receiving that shot with Rounds 3-6. I developed a high spiking fever/chills right before Round 2 which was treated with antibotics. After that, my onco ordered the Neulasta shot after the remaining rounds of chemo. She is one of those oncos that orders the Neulasta shot only after the patient demonstrates that the shot is necessary. I used to receive my shot in my tummy since that is where I have some fat and didn't want to have my arm hurting from the shot. I also took regular 24 hour Claritin the morning that I had my afternoon Neulasta shot in hopes that it would help prevent the bone pain related to the Neulasta. There is an ongoing clinical trial investigating the use of Claritin for this purpose. I was fortunate that I did not have any bone pain relating to the Neulasta shot but one needs to remember that muscle aches/joint bone pain are side effects of this chemo regimen.

My office closes at 12 on Friday, so I have been staying till about 1:30 and then leave and go to chemo at 2:00. Are you able to drive yourself home afterwords, then told me not to, but truthfully as doped up as I am I would not be able to - my husband always takes me home, I walk in the door go straigt to bed sleep until he wakes me up to tell me supper is ready, I will eat, stay awake about an hour, go back to sleep, and Sat I am good to go again. I agree with you on the tiredness and because is it cumulative, it adds up. But I am so thankful, no nausea. 4 more of these and then FEC. I do have my tree put up, it is not decorated and I beginning to wonder if I should just leave it that way, wonder what the grandkids will think? I did my first 5 Taxols with an IV but my veins collapsed, so now I have a PICC line, They don't have to stick me for anything. It is wonderful. It is a pain in the butt to wrap up before shower time so it doesn't get wet - we use Glad Press n Seal. My chemo nurse changes the bandage on it every Friday when I have chemo so that's not too bad. I keep thinking this time next year, we all will have the prettiest decorated houses, we'll be full on energy, have hair and this will all be a memory. What do you think? Jessee, I haven't had to have the neulatsa shot with Taxol, my chemo nurse said most people don't so hopefully you wont have to. I really don't have to have anything extra. They put in all in the IV before Taxol. I get Ativan, Benadryl, Decadron, Pepcid, and Zofran. Then the Taxol. Boy, no wonder I can not drive.

"5ff3417e-5578-4f12-a474-4b88598d7a89","Hi Debbie, Yes the plan is to still go to Boston. I did a long run on the 8th for 3hr 52min and managed to cover 34km so it is going to be a long slow one. I think I have done really well on the ac and have one more next week (then taxol) but this time the fatigue has really got me. I have been running every second day and doing my eliptical but cover only about 12km. I have always been competitive but only with myself and wanting to do better but have decided to wrap my head around going back to basics and enjoy the scenery, time out and good company. Looking forward to Boston and achange from things. I am a bit concerned about lymphedema and flying. I had 5 nodes removed and some times feel a burning sensation (no swelling) more than other times especially after long runs and hard workout on eliptical. Not sure if I am worrying for nothing or what to do. How does one organize meeting someone at the Boston? Soooo many people. Would love to meet you along the way.laurel","this","but","257","VBZ","232","time","fatigu","237","taxol","264","4","RB","next","0","the","RB","1","NN","this","week","DT","time","drug-SE","then","DT","FALSE","got","JJ","VBN","NN","has","fatigue","CC","NN","realli","taxol","false","1","DT","NN","0","false","2","invalid","NN","102","102","102","-1","44","1","44","-1","25","-1","25","1"

I was diagnosed 12/05 as well, but started with widespread DCIS, had mast, found .2cm IDC, went back in for axillary dissection with 0 of 5 nodes, did reconstruction with mast andwas put on tamoxifen. ER+/PR+/HER2+++. All through reconstruction I felt like I was waiting for the other shoe to drop andit did just as I was finishing up with my tattoo - I found a lump in my reconstructed breast! Surgeon was pretty sure it was scar tissue but no, it was IDC again, this time 3.5cm er-/pr-/HER2+++! That wasa little over a year ago. Since then I've had chemo (A/C, T/H & still H through August), radiation(SUCKED! major burns), hair loss, brows, lashes (losing these again as we speak), weight gain, fatique, neuropathy in my hands- etc. I totally get tired of this and I am so scared of another recurrence or new primary but I will fight this until I know I can't any longer!

The women on this board are incredibly supportive - ask questions, whine. Someone willbe here. Please call your oncologist and go over how you are feeling.

The nails hurt to touch and the skin is thin and peeling. I think I'm also starting to feel the neuropathy in a couple of toes on my right foot. I wear clogs outside and slippers inside, so my toes aren't cramped. No bone pain yet, but the nurse said it wouldn't start until this afternoon or tomorrow if at all. I'm hoping NOT! I'm having some very mild nausea, similar to what I had at day #11-13 post AC. Don't need any pills, but need to be careful about what and when I eat. Kim -- Glad you checked in -- you seem to be a week ahead of most of us with the taxol. Did you take anything for the pain. Marsha -- Glad that your onc and primary are looking out for you re PS! My SNB shots were actually radioactive. If the bs couldn't find the node during surgery then she would have injected the blue dye when I was under. I wonder if that is why I didn't have as much pain as all of the rest of you. It was painful, but bearable. I was such a nervous wreck that whole day (and very teary) that I think some ativan would have smoothed it over a bit. OK, all of us on taxol.

She stitched my skin to my ribs both axially (4 columns of stitches) and in my IMF (3 rows of stitches) to keep the capsule the right size.

His opinion is that I don't have that much bottoming out (different opinion than my exchange PS).

SABCS: Vitamin D Reduces Aromatase Inhibitor Pain By Charles Bankhead, Staff Writer, MedPage Today Published: December 15, 2009 Reviewed by Zalman S. Agus, MD; Emeritus Professor University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. SAN ANTONIO -- High-dose vitamin D significantly reduced muscle and joint pain in breast cancer patients treated with the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole (Arimidex), results of a small, randomized clinical trial showed. Weekly vitamin D supplementation led to significant improvement in pain and mobility after two months. The improvement began to dissipate after patients were switched to a monthly supplementation schedule and had largely disappeared by four to six months. ""Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings, but this pilot study suggests that high-dose vitamin D significantly improves anastrozole-induced muscle and joint tenderness and that this beneficial effect disappears once vitamin D is supplemented monthly, rather than weekly,"" Antonella Rastelli, MD, of Washington University in St. Louis, said at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. ""Moreover, bone mineral density of the femoral neck appears to be preserved at six months in patients who receive high vitamin D supplementation."" Action Points  * Explain to patients that the study indicated that high-dose vitamin D might relieve musculoskeletal pain caused by treatment of breast cancer with the aromatase inhibitor class of drugs. * Note that this study involved a small number of patients. * Note that this study was published as an abstract and presented at a conference. These data and conclusions should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. High-dose vitamin D was well tolerated and did not cause any toxicity,"" she added. ""Some patients who received high-dose vitamin D demonstrated a propensity for higher urinary calcium excretion, which may lead to kidney stones."" Musculoskeletal pain is a class adverse effect of aromatase inhibitors. The St. Louis group previously had reported a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in breast cancer patients with musculoskeletal pain (SABCS 2004; Abstract P2-443), along with anecdotal evidence that weekly high-dose vitamin D might relieve it. In follow-up to the earlier work, Rastelli and colleagues conducted a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of high-dose vitamin D for patients in these circumstances. Eligibility criteria included postmenopausal, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer; at least eight weeks of anastrozole therapy prior to enrollment; serum calcium 10.3 mg/dL; marginal 25-OH vitamin D level (10 to 29 ng/mL); 24-hour urinary calcium excretion 250 mg/g; and a history of generalized musculoskeletal pain that began or worsened since starting treatment with the aromatase inhibitor. Investigators excluded patients with metastatic breast cancer and those with a history of kidney stones, active primary hyperparathyroidism, Paget's disease, or severe arthritis or neuropathy, as well as patients with serum 25-OH vitamin D levels 30 ng/mL. All patients received 1,000 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D3 daily. Patients randomized to vitamin D supplementation received 50,000 IU/week for eight or 16 weeks, depending on baseline 25-OH vitamin D levels. They were then switched to monthly vitamin D doses of 50,000 IU. The remaining patients received matching placebo supplementation. All patients completed validated pain and impairment questionnaires at baseline and after two, four, and six months. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine and proximal femur was assessed at baseline and six months. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in aromatase inhibitor-induced musculoskeletal symptoms. The secondary outcome was change in BMD. The study involved 60 patients, 30 assigned to each treatment group. Vitamin D patients with hypercalciuria at the two-month follow-up visit withdrew from the study. At two months, patients randomized to vitamin D had significant improvement in pain compared with the placebo group, as assessed by scores on the Brief Pain Index (P=0.009) and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (P=0.01). Patients in the vitamin D group also had significantly better scores on an assessment of walking and climbing stairs (P=0.04). Most of the benefit in the vitamin D group disappeared at four to eight months after a majority of the patients had switched to monthly supplementation, said Rastelli. BMD assessment revealed a trend toward maintenance of bone density in the femoral neck in the vitamin D group (P=0.08). Future studies should evaluate the impact of continuing weekly supplementation for a longer period, Rastelli and colleagues concluded in a poster presentation. Additionally, inclusion criteria should be expanded to accommodate women with normal vitamin D levels, in light of recent evidence of significant differences in aromatase inhibitor-induced musculoskeletal pain in women with serum vitamin D levels >66 ng/mL (Breast Cancer Res Treat 2010; 119: 111-18). Researchers should also consider other forms of vitamin D, they added. Cholecalciferol, for example, maintains more stable serum vitamin D levels than the ergocalciferol used in the study. The study was supported by AstraZeneca. Rastelli disclosed relationships with AstraZeneca and Lilly.

Investigators excluded patients with metastatic breast cancer and those with a history of kidney stones, active primary hyperparathyroidism, Paget's disease, or severe arthritis or neuropathy, as well as patients with serum 25-OH vitamin D levels 30 ng/mL. All patients received 1,000 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D3 daily. Patients randomized to vitamin D supplementation received 50,000 IU/week for eight or 16 weeks, depending on baseline 25-OH vitamin D levels. They were then switched to monthly vitamin D doses of 50,000 IU. The remaining patients received matching placebo supplementation. All patients completed validated pain and impairment questionnaires at baseline and after two, four, and six months. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine and proximal femur was assessed at baseline and six months. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in aromatase inhibitor-induced musculoskeletal symptoms. The secondary outcome was change in BMD. The study involved 60 patients, 30 assigned to each treatment group. Vitamin D patients with hypercalciuria at the two-month follow-up visit withdrew from the study. At two months, patients randomized to vitamin D had significant improvement in pain compared with the placebo group, as assessed by scores on the Brief Pain Index (P=0.009) and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (P=0.01). Patients in the vitamin D group also had significantly better scores on an assessment of walking and climbing stairs (P=0.04). Most of the benefit in the vitamin D group disappeared at four to eight months after a majority of the patients had switched to monthly supplementation, said Rastelli. BMD assessment revealed a trend toward maintenance of bone density in the femoral neck in the vitamin D group (P=0.08). Future studies should evaluate the impact of continuing weekly supplementation for a longer period, Rastelli and colleagues concluded in a poster presentation. Additionally, inclusion criteria should be expanded to accommodate women with normal vitamin D levels, in light of recent evidence of significant differences in aromatase inhibitor-induced musculoskeletal pain in women with serum vitamin D levels >66 ng/mL (Breast Cancer Res Treat 2010; 119: 111-18). Researchers should also consider other forms of vitamin D, they added. Cholecalciferol, for example, maintains more stable serum vitamin D levels than the ergocalciferol used in the study. The study was supported by AstraZeneca. Rastelli disclosed relationships with AstraZeneca and Lilly.

I was to have chemo #3 today and was at the treatment center in Philly. Saw my Onc and my nurse practioner. I am NOT receiving anymore Taxotere. I've been having severe itching/burning/rashisng all over my body since day #16 of my 2nd treatment (started last week) and today is Day 21. The Onc feels it s an allergic reaction and having another treatment could be ""problematic"". I guess he's saying it won't be good to have another Taxotere treatment! LOLHe also felt I possibly could be having a reaction to Neulasta but doesn't think that's it. So here is the skinny - I could either stop chemo altogether or try another regimine which would be Adrimycin. I opted to try the ""Red Devil"". I'd rather try another chemo than none at all since I'm node positive - call me crazy. I have to have an Echocardiogram first, he's not doing a MUGA. I had a heart stress test in May and Radioactive MRI test back in April for another issue. I did stay in Philly ALL DAY today and they were so good to squeeze me in for the Echo. I tentatively scheduled chemo for the new drug this Friday, barring any issues with the Echo. I'll call tomorrow to check that everything is a go. Good thing is once start, I can do my final chemo in two weeks, not 3. Yay! Ok -- anyone on Adryimycin and can you tell me what to expect?? The Onc said the biggest issue is nausea, but I can deal with that over the itching/burning. I hope I don't develop worse see effects!! I'm HIGHLY ALLERGIC to lots of med and my allergy list is like a laundry list. I pray all will be well with this new regimine. Thanks for listening!!

LOLHe also felt I possibly could be having a reaction to Neulasta but doesn't think that's it. So here is the skinny - I could either stop chemo altogether or try another regimine which would be Adrimycin. I opted to try the ""Red Devil"". I'd rather try another chemo than none at all since I'm node positive - call me crazy. I have to have an Echocardiogram first, he's not doing a MUGA. I had a heart stress test in May and Radioactive MRI test back in April for another issue. I did stay in Philly ALL DAY today and they were so good to squeeze me in for the Echo. I tentatively scheduled chemo for the new drug this Friday, barring any issues with the Echo. I'll call tomorrow to check that everything is a go. Good thing is once start, I can do my final chemo in two weeks, not 3. Yay! Ok -- anyone on Adryimycin and can you tell me what to expect?? The Onc said the biggest issue is nausea, but I can deal with that over the itching/burning. I hope I don't develop worse see effects!! I'm HIGHLY ALLERGIC to lots of med and my allergy list is like a laundry list. I pray all will be well with this new regimine. Thanks for listening!!

"6a19b4d3-f151-43be-b60e-ff19d0210444","zuffa, what your doctor said to you sounds similar to what my doctor said. I'm 56. She said I was strong and should cope with chemo well and be able to mostly work through it. She said that I was obviously a driven person and she didn't expect me to have ""chemo brain"" problems. That is somewhat true though 90% sounds a bit high. I mostly work from home but my job involves some business travel. Fortunately we were able to schedule my chemo so that most of my travel falls during the third week of cycles when I should feel pretty normal. I'm on TCH like Sue and we are an example of how chemo hits different folks different ways. For me the day of treatment and the day after I feel pretty normal. Some people get Benedryl as a pre-med with their chemo - I think it is because Taxotere and Taxol sometimes cause an allergic reaction. If you need that, you may be pretty sleepy on the day of chemo - I look around the room and see many people sleep through much of their chemo. I don't get Benedryl - I take my laptop and cell phone and put in close to a full days work on chemo days. The first time the days 3 through 7 were bad for me - a couple I didn't work at all and others I had to take a nap and work only part of the day. For the second time my medication was adjusted (a bit lower dose of chemo drugs, adding Neupogen and tapering the steroid). Day 4 I started to get tired and needed an afternoon nap. Day 5 I was exhausted all day and did a couple of conference calls and not much else. Day 6 and 7 were the weekend and I mostly rested. Day 8 I worked most of the day but needed to stop ealy to take a nap. Day 9 I'm pretty much back to normal. So, it looks like I will miss about 1 day per cycle and have 2 that I'm not entirely functional. For 15 work days per cycle that isn't quite 90%. Also, the rest of the cycle I still need more rest than I do when not on chemo. I did a one week business trip the third week of the first chemo. This was for technical meetings including some that I chair so it is extremely demanding. During the day I was pretty normal but I couldn't do evening meetings because around 8 o'clock I would get to the point where I had to rest. It was great to go to my meeting and be with my colleagues who are all very supportive. It has been great to have time to focus on work and not think about cancer. Colleagues do ask how I'm doing of course, but they have let me guide how much we talk about that and then we move on to work. For me to not work would be much harder - work is too much of my normal life and I appreciate the chance to be normal 80% of the time on chemo. During the hard part of my cycle, I'm very glad to be working from home where I can lie down for a bit on a bad day.","caus","sometim","818","NULL","793","an","allerg","798","taxol","835","3","CC","becaus","0","an","NULL","7","VBP","sometim","taxoter","DT","caus","drug-SE","and","RB","FALSE","NULL","IN","NULL","JJ","NULL","allergic reaction","RB","DT","NULL","Taxol","false","1","VBP","NNP","0","false","8","invalid","NNP","25","6","8","80","80","80","1","131","8","1","131","8"

"6c113c09-cfca-4944-9362-0a13d10670e4","Hi all - Just a repeat of my offer to try to chart everyone's chemo dates. PM me with your tx dates and type of chemo. I have 3 of us in so far. I had some bone pain last night from the neulasta in my back, hips, and legs. I could barely move, but I woke up fine this morning. Viddie - how your finger? Rebecca - I think it is hilarious that the snack basket was sponsored by Marinol. Thanks for that good laugh. I took Marinol after my first chemo and it was horrible. I called the onc and told him I wouldn't take it again, so they adjusted my meds some. Too bad I couldn't tolerate it because it totally worked for the nausea. T4T - I have 2 brothers in the military - what branch were you in? I remember having to go to all the family meetings before my brother deployed and learning all about tricare. Reobertin - my nurse told me the same about Ativan, but said that they could give me something else to help sleep on other nights when I don't need the ativan for nausea. Aldora - good to see the hat again. My 6 year old has one just like it with a matching scarf. She thinks it's very fashionable! Your son is adorable - thanks for the pictures. Aldora & Susan - I'm glad to see there are a few of us on FEC. It's the C that gives you the sinus/headache thing. They gave me tylenol and it helped a bit.","give","that","1247","NULL","1226","you","sinus","1227","c","1267","4","DT","it","0","the","NULL","21","PRP","give","'s","DT","you","drug-SE","the","VBZ","FALSE","NULL","PRP","NULL","JJ","NULL","sinus/headache thing","WDT","PRP","NULL","C","false","1","VBZ","NNP","0","false","22","valid","VBZ","1","-1","44","80","80","80","8","9","9","9","9","1"
"6c9d0b13-9de3-4d20-bca3-a7cef0e79900","I have been taking tamoxifen at night but think I'm going to switch to the day based off your all's comments! Not sure how many more nights of no sleep I can take from the hot flashes. Kate - I just had a fellow co-worker get diagnosed with BC and she came to me looking for advice. I was happy to share my story but tried to let her know everyone is different and so everyone's story will be different. It was strange to be the one on the otherside but then also brought up fears I haven't thought of for awhile since I've tried blocking a lot of the ""what ifs"" out of my mind. Definitley, 2014 will be a better year! I'm at least trying to think positive about my bad luck this year - it's almost to the point it's comical! I mean serioulsy. BC, car accident, fire at reception hall for my brother wedding, neighbor's stone facing fell off front of her house due to storm last Sunday, and fellow co-worker (whom I work very closely with)diagnosed with BC. I've started telling people around me to be careful because I'm not so lucky this year and may rub off on them :) :) :) Thanks for all the well wishes everyone! Went to the hair dresser yesterday with my daughter to get her hair trimmed and had them look at me to see when I could start going in to get my hair shaped into something presentable. They said probably another 4 weeks. So far it's coming in evenly and about the same color as my original hair prior chemo so we'll see. I'm excited about when I'll finally not have to be self conscious and wear scarves/hats.

"6cc516e8-3e98-4a00-819a-0337237ce400","Nichcosmo, Treatment for HER2+ cancer is a marathon not a sprint! In fact, I'll be getting Herceptin infusions, every three weeks, through September. Beginning about a year ago, I began what is called ""neoadjuvant chemo"" or chemo before surgery. Because my lump was big (5 cm.+!) we were hoping to shrink the tumor so I could have the option of a lumpectomy rather than a mastectomy. I had four infusions of adriamycin and cytoxan, every two weeks (this is known as dense dose AC, in contrast to AC that is infused every three weeks). That is when my hair fell out and I began wearing a wig. AC made me spacey and lethargic. I had heartburn one week, but didn't have it for the rest of my treatment. Days 4 and 5 were the worst as far as fatigue went. After AC, I did twelve weeks of Taxol and Herceptin (a targeted therapy for HER2+ cancer) every week. I also had four infusions of Perjeta (targeted therapy for HER2+ cancer) with that combo every three weeks. Taxol/Herceptin/(Perjeta) gave me mild diarrhea, starting Day #3. I managed that with OTC meds like Imodium. When I finished chemo, I had an MRI and a PET scan. They showed that chemo had destroyed all of the active cancer in my breast and compromised lymph node. In January 2015, I had my lumpectomy. My surgeon took out a golfball-sized amount of tissue from my right breast, and 20 lymph nodes from my armpit. Recovery was OK, though I did have to have a seroma (excess fluid) drained. In February 2015, I started hormonal therapy (Aromasin). It's a pill that you take once a day. My cancer was fed by estrogen, so Aromasin helps suck all of the estrogen out of my body. Normally, premenopausal women get Tamoxifen, but the recent SOFT study showed that premenopausal women who go into chemical menopause and who take an aromatase inhibitor (like Aromasin) have better outcomes. To achieve chemical menopause, I get a shot every month of Zoladex. So far, my side effects from Aromasin have involved mild hot flashes and moodiness. To deal with these side effects, I take Celexa (it's an SSRI) daily. In March 2015, I started radiation therapy. I did whole breast radiation and seven or eight boosts (radiation that is directed solely at your surgical scar). Radiation turned my breast red, like it had a sunburn. It felt tender. But, the burn faded in a few weeks. I was very lucky, as I have had few problems with any of my treatments. I worked through chemo and rads, though I reduced some of my workload. (I resigned from a few committees in my department at work -- I teach at a university.) I am also fortunate to be able to work at home on the days I don't teach. Hopefully, you won't have to get all the treatment I had. I was Stage IIIa when my cancer was detected. I feel very fortunate to be feeling good and to have excellent treatment options in my community.","better","have","1969","CC","1812","outcom","hot","1820","aromasin","1980","25","IN","aromatas","2","mild","NNS","49","VBN","have","inhibitor","JJ","involv","drug-SE","like","VBP","FALSE","NULL","NN","NULL","JJ","and","hot flashes","VBP","NNS","moodi","Aromasin","false","3","JJR","NNP","1","false","54","invalid","NN","1","115","48","25","145","80","44","44","53","44","49","69"

Because my lump was big (5 cm.+!) we were hoping to shrink the tumor so I could have the option of a lumpectomy rather than a mastectomy. I had four infusions of adriamycin and cytoxan, every two weeks (this is known as dense dose AC, in contrast to AC that is infused every three weeks). That is when my hair fell out and I began wearing a wig. AC made me spacey and lethargic. I had heartburn one week, but didn't have it for the rest of my treatment. Days 4 and 5 were the worst as far as fatigue went. After AC, I did twelve weeks of Taxol and Herceptin (a targeted therapy for HER2+ cancer) every week. I also had four infusions of Perjeta (targeted therapy for HER2+ cancer) with that combo every three weeks. Taxol/Herceptin/(Perjeta) gave me mild diarrhea, starting Day #3. I managed that with OTC meds like Imodium. When I finished chemo, I had an MRI and a PET scan. They showed that chemo had destroyed all of the active cancer in my breast and compromised lymph node. In January 2015, I had my lumpectomy. My surgeon took out a golfball-sized amount of tissue from my right breast, and 20 lymph nodes from my armpit. Recovery was OK, though I did have to have a seroma (excess fluid) drained. In February 2015, I started hormonal therapy (Aromasin). It's a pill that you take once a day. My cancer was fed by estrogen, so Aromasin helps suck all of the estrogen out of my body. Normally, premenopausal women get Tamoxifen, but the recent SOFT study showed that premenopausal women who go into chemical menopause and who take an aromatase inhibitor (like Aromasin) have better outcomes. To achieve chemical menopause, I get a shot every month of Zoladex. So far, my side effects from Aromasin have involved mild hot flashes and moodiness. To deal with these side effects, I take Celexa (it's an SSRI) daily. In March 2015, I started radiation therapy. I did whole breast radiation and seven or eight boosts (radiation that is directed solely at your surgical scar). Radiation turned my breast red, like it had a sunburn. It felt tender. But, the burn faded in a few weeks. I was very lucky, as I have had few problems with any of my treatments. I worked through chemo and rads, though I reduced some of my workload. (I resigned from a few committees in my department at work -- I teach at a university.) I am also fortunate to be able to work at home on the days I don't teach. Hopefully, you won't have to get all the treatment I had. I was Stage IIIa when my cancer was detected. I feel very fortunate to be feeling good and to have excellent treatment options in my community.","better","have","1864","PRP","1812","outcom","menopaus","1820","aromasin","1873","6","IN","aromatas","0","chemic","VBP","49","VB","to","inhibitor","NN","achiev","drug-SE","like","TO","FALSE","a","NN","DT","NN","i","menopause","VBP","NNS","get","Aromasin","false","2","JJR","NNP","0","false","50","invalid","NN","1","115","48","44","44","25","44","44","53","8","142","148"

My husband is adjusting to when to back off and when to jump in and rescue he rest if the family. Jmg - we're all going to have bad days (weeks) and that's why we're all here. Know I am keeping you close in prayers. As for chemo yesterday, it was the MOST BIRIN THING I DID SONCE MY 12th acls refresher. And the medical peeps know how bad the first 10 are. I packed everything suggested in my chemo bag but have discovered maybe that's meant to stay home as a resource bag and I should just bring the kindle, phone, blankie which I didn't need but everyone was jealous of) and a charger. In for 850, labs (elevated livers now all norm!!!! ), iv of saline, one of Benadryl, one of saline lunch, dessert, candy, and about 1230 chemo. Taxotere burned like potassium and my NEW chemo nurse (not he old one I was supposed to have) wanted to know why no port cause my veins ""suck and are thin and too irritated"" . Ha!!!!!! Vindication!!!! She finally was one who listened to me like a another vein pro and not some whiny patient trying to tell he how to do her job. Of course the 1.5"" x .5"" bruise from mondays CT also led some support. She gets the veins for chemo. I get them 10 years later when their veins are worse. So she's taking to onco. He's going to say no again cause now it's only 3 more. But I feel like someone at least listened taut time. She asks Bout the additional scar, so I tapped on my prosthetic eye. She definitely understood my ""it's no big deal. I've been thru more"" comment. Creepy but totally effective and got my point across !!!!! On a happy note I LOVE my new short hair. Even the color he added for fun since it was only temporary. He suggested curly hair women try ethnic wig shops and I know of 2 so since feel great going there todayI feel euphoric now that first chemo is over. Hoping this is normal. I'm going to crash when I stop decadron Sunday aren't i!!!???!!!

I really hope that we are all just so busy getting on with our lives that we just didn't get round to it - how far we have all come! Geri - good to hear that each day is getting better. ""good"" tired and pain is always better than the alternative Titan, just the thought of the Taxol pain makes me shiver. I swear that sometimes I still feel it in my jawbone (yuck!). Sounds like you had fun at the beach! I think that sometimes we need to let go and have a laugh. Of course, as you say, always preferable without the kids around, as they just want the ground to open up and swallow them. My husband is a real joker and it drives the kids crazy. Helen - Hope you are doing ok. How many Zometas do you need to have? I hope you are ok with it and not suffering any side effects - I think we have had enough of those. I have been doing ok this week. We had visitors from overseas and it was fun to catch up. All the kids disappeared downstairs and we ate, drank and generally had a good evening. I have still not started taking my bone meds, because I am so nervous about the acid reflux, but I know I need to start. I think Monday will be a good day - I take them once a week. I am feeling tired as ever, but the drop in temperature is making it a little easier to sleep at night. The hot flashes don't seem so bad at the moment. I am still not making any progress on my weight, those few pounds will not budge and I am trying not to become too obsessive about it. Alaina - how are you doing? Are you back on your feet? Lena - let us know you are ok. To Betsy, Amy and anyone else I may not have mentioned - hope all is well. I am sending you all hugs and have a wonderful sunny weekend!

"6df58fd4-74bb-4c69-b6e4-ef8e9fd64ba9","I'm marking my seventh year post-diagnosis and treatment for stage I HER-2 positive breast cancer. I was part of the APT trial at Dana-Farber, which evaluated the efficacy of using taxol and herceptin to treat small, node-negative HER-2 positive BC. I had a lumpectomy, 12 sessions of TH, 33 rounds of radiation, and finished the year of Herceptin. I took letrozole for five years. Excellent check-ups since. Those long days of fatigue and anxiety are a thing of the past. I do have peripheral neuropathy from the taxol, but nothing's perfect! Unfortuately, I was diagnosed in March with a rare form of Hodgkins lymphoma, totally unrelated to the breast cancer. I'm getting excellent care at Dana-Farber, and am reassured that the prognosis for this form of lymphoma is excellent.

"6e21e798-4c1c-40e2-aea2-272230672484","Morning all. beautiful day! Welcome Brat and Char. to the club no one wants to join but somehow our litle group does OK and we do try and find the humor in this whole mess! Brat. you can certainly drive yourself to chemo! It was suggested that I have a driver or someone standing by just in case I had a reaction to anything. I didn't. In fact I was one of the lucky ones in that except for my hair, I had no side effects except for a yucky metallic taste for about 5-7 days after chemo. Crystal Light lemonade very neatly took care of that. and I think most of the ladies drank gallons of this stuff. Really helped. I don't work outside the home but I was able to do everything I usually do, including hitting the gym every morning. I did taxotere and carboplatin, but also had to do Herceptin for a year as I was HER2+. The only problem I had with driving was the large doses of Benadryl and making me too sleepy for driving, but that was when I was just on Herceptin which they ran in in 30 min. They just decreased the benadryl and I was fine. Where will you be having your chemo? I got all (and I do mean ALL!!!) my wigs from wigs.com. If you see something you like, first check out their return policy and then join (it's free) and then you get a discount. For your eyes, don't worry if all your lashes fall out (mine didn't all at one time). extra eyeliner and no one will notice. Char. you are perfectly normal. You are at the end and waiting for the OLD CHAR to come back. But alas. she is gone. However. the NEW CHAR is evolving and she will be the model for the ""new Normal"", which while taking a bit of getting used to. is not all that bad. Our lives have turned 180 and we can't go back, but we certainly can go forward. and quite happily and joyfully. It is a process and not much fun. Heck. ask me about my ""fort""!!!! Rita. busy golfing I see! Good for you!!! Jackie. you have the washer/dryer up and running? How did DH's tests come out, or did I miss that? BJ,. last full day! YIPPEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!! Navy. need pix, please! Elf. OK, there are rules about being sick on vacay, aren't there? Hope you can enjoy today at least. really nice out! Lunchbunch is meeting tomorrow at Maggiano's in Schaumburg (by Woodfield). please come if you can. it's at 12:30! We tend to laugh. A LOT. and get a bit crazy/noisy. so be warned! All those that I have missed. hope you are doing well today and can enjoy just being alive!

I agree, it's annoying to hear suggestions which may or may not help, as if you have any control over thrush. Everyone gets different side effects. I have no neuropathy from taxotere or pain from neulasta. The only thing that helped me a little was to anticipate thrush, and start diflucan at the first sign of a slightly white tongue and that funny burning feeling. The nurse told me to take 2 diflucan the first day and have the prescriptions ready before chemo. It wasn't as bad this time.

I gave up on nystatin except for day one-thinking it may prevent thrush from spreading down my throat. But, for me, at least, best treatment early diflucan, double dose first day.

The pains were severe enough to interfere with my daily workout so my oncologist agreed to a two- week holidays for two reasons, one is to determine whether the pains in my toes were caused by Arimidex and the other is to seek some relief from the pains. Well, the fairly severe pains did subside. In its place came nausea when I resumed Arimidex two weeks later. I understand nausea usually comes at the beginning of Arimidex. I, with luck had never experienced it in the two years time until then. Nausea was tough to bear. You feel like throwing up all the time. I searched two breast cancer blogs extensively and found seaman's band and candied ginger, the two remedies cured my nausea in several weeks. The second Arimidex holiday was triggered by high blood pressure. My blood pressure was through the roof all of a sudden and required higher dose of blood pressure medicine. My oncologist did not believe Arimidex was the cause. A little comfort came just in time from a pamphlet sent by AstraZeneca, maker of Arimidex, stating that Arimidex can cause high blood pressure. My two-week holiday passed without conclusive finding whether the high blood pressure was caused by Arimidex. Instead I got hip pains on the left side after resuming Arimidex.

"762482f9-96d0-4fb1-a3dd-c204d45f5d29","Arimidex holidaysI have, over the past two years and half, taken two Arimidex holidays. The first time was for painful toes on the left foot. The pains were severe enough to interfere with my daily workout so my oncologist agreed to a two- week holidays for two reasons, one is to determine whether the pains in my toes were caused by Arimidex and the other is to seek some relief from the pains. Well, the fairly severe pains did subside. In its place came nausea when I resumed Arimidex two weeks later. I understand nausea usually comes at the beginning of Arimidex. I, with luck had never experienced it in the two years time until then. Nausea was tough to bear. You feel like throwing up all the time. I searched two breast cancer blogs extensively and found seaman's band and candied ginger, the two remedies cured my nausea in several weeks. The second Arimidex holiday was triggered by high blood pressure. My blood pressure was through the roof all of a sudden and required higher dose of blood pressure medicine. My oncologist did not believe Arimidex was the cause. A little comfort came just in time from a pamphlet sent by AstraZeneca, maker of Arimidex, stating that Arimidex can cause high blood pressure. My two-week holiday passed without conclusive finding whether the high blood pressure was caused by Arimidex. Instead I got hip pains on the left side after resuming Arimidex.

Lolis I answered your question on another thread but will do so again just incase. :-). no drs at cvh will discuss marijuana but the nurses will. They suggest weed to manage pain. Yeh sure! I tried a bit when I went through the pain episode if taxotere, had a panic attack and ended up on the kitchen floor. Lol. The pain did subside though but despite being a rocker, it's not for me. LolSo far I haven't had to take any pain meds since starting taxol. My infusion went well yesterday. I think that I fell asleep in the chair. I went alone and felt more comfortable that way as I felt that I didn't have to ""entertain"" anyone. Even though whoever went with me would encourage me to sleep if I wanted, I never felt right doing soSo, 3 more rounds. Next Monday is my bloodwork and meeting with my onc. Then wed is herceptin and taxolHas anyone heard about a trial being done at princess Margaret to determine if herceptin will be beneficial for you? Someone told me about this a few days ago. I'll be asking my oncAll of my events are confirmed!

I feel like I stepped on an ant bed barefoot! This was the second time I mentioned this discomfort to him but after last night he gave in and prescribed me Gabapentin. Do any of you have any experience with what I'm feeling or this drug? I'm just worried about the neuropathy being permanent. Honestly, I would trade a few A/C sessions for what I'm feeling right now. It's soo hard to ignore at work or out in public. And the hot flashes, those are another story. But I'm going to start Effexor tomorrow for that.

"79e1b08d-6fa1-4cca-af80-18a3c520abe1","I've been on tamoxifen for about 4 months now and I also get the lupron shot once per month. At first my side effects weren't too bad but they've gotten a bit worse. The main one is the hot flashes. At first they were minor but now they'll get to the point where I break out in a sweat. I get night sweats every once in a while, too, where I'll wake up dripping with sweat and my shirt will be damp. But those happen infrequently. I take Effexor and that has helped immensely with the hot flashes. My doctor also told me to stay away from hot beverages and alcohol; I've noticed that both of those things make it worse. I try to dress in light layers. I live in Wisconsin and usually by this point in the year I can wear my Ugg boots and scarves but if I wear either of those things and I get too warm, I'll have a hot flash. I haven't had a period but that's probably because of the lupron. And I hate to say this out loud but I've gained 12 pounds. I work out 5 - 6 days a week and it hasn't helped. I haven't done very well watching my diet, though, so I'm going to have to pay more attention to that. Usually, if I work out, the weight will come off. But not this time and I think it's probably because of the lupron. My doc said that my side effects are probably a little bit worse because of the combination of tamoxifen and lupron.

The only SE I've noticed is that my eyes are dry. I'm having a problem with my left one (I had LASIK 4 yrs ago in the that eye)being so dry that it is red as if I have an eye infection. I went to the eye dr and she said it could be Effexor and/or Tamoxifen. I'm using allergy drops and ""tear"" drops to help alleviate the irritation. I can't really tell if Effexor is helping that much with hot flashes because I had relatively few during chemo and am having about the same # - mainly, in the p.m. Good luck transitioning over to Effexor. Kudos to all who are out there exercising. I truly believe it helps the frame of mind and prevent recurrence!!!

A very expensive repair even with the insurance $$. They depreciate your roofs and siding so you never get what it costs to replace it! Mother Nature has spoken! Here is a pic of my hair. last chemo Oct 26th. about 2 1/2 months later. http://www.flickr.com/photos/pinkocean/4258750383/Sorry, Can't get the picture to load. so copy the link above to go to my flickr hair pictureNow have 4 rads out of the way. so far uneventful. nothing it speak of. It's pretty quick and the staff is really nice and fun! The only thing I notice is sometimes thirsty, but can't say it from the rads. Everywhere indoors is running heat and things are extremel dry inside. I started my Tamoxifen yesterday. so far no changes. I have been dealing with 10-15 hot flashes a day already, so maybe there won't be much of a change. I'll keep you all posted on the progression. I have lucked into a local store that wants to carry my ceramic pendants and jewelry. I am also setting up beads (like a mini bead store) there as well. It feels good to be back to business, but it's really terrific that it's at my own pace & I can make my own schedule for stocking and adjusting things! So some income and some work. As Martha would say. ""It's a good thing! ""I had to get the ekg before my sentinal lymph node biopsy. same day surgery. It's good to hear many of you are on the other side. I continue to follow the rest of your progress. can't wait for our celebration in March! Be patient! You will be back to better than normal!

I was one of those intensely irritating girls who, except for the hair loss, experienced very few se's from chemo and those only lasted a few days each round - really was just the metally taste in my mouth. I guess I need to be smacked once for that too! No nausea or fatigue, but then I took my meds religiously whether or not I had symptoms and that might have made a difference. Well. off to try on the new spring stuff I got at AnnTaylor Loft this am - Geneva Commons is right next door to the Delnor Hospital complex and I decided that I had 2 GREAT reports and I deserved something cute and pretty and springy to wear.

"7f72f483-c5f3-4509-8699-02be94ec4639","Hi gals! I am glad to find this thread . Janet, our diagnoses were pretty much the same (we've commented on it before :-) . and heart damage is very much on my mind. I had DD A/C (and we know that Adriamycin can cause heart damage, especially when it is administered dose dense). You dodged that bullet, and I wish that my onc gave it the consideration that your onc did by giving you Taxotere and Carboplatin instead. Throughout my BC journey, the stuff that's supposed to be ""rare"" events have been happening to me, and I'm just a little spooked about the heart damage possibility, especially as we learned from Debbie's experience that the damage from chemo can show up so many years later. Yes, it's rare to get a pneumo thorax during port placement, but my surgeon pierced my lung accidentally and there I was. Scary. Yes, lots of patients get MammoSite radiation treatment without developing a big whopping seroma, but mine did. Needed to be drained 3 times and eventually subsided 8 months after surgery. Seven weeks ago a blood clot formed in subclavian vein, around the catheter of my port. Needed ER care, and has been on Warfarin (Coumadin) since, for blood thinning. Six weeks ago, immediately after Herceptin infusion no. 7, I developed a searing pain across my ribs, under breast and left arm (left breast had the lumpectomy and Mammosite radiation). Was still at onc's office, so the nurse suggested he sees me. Standing up, he pokes a finger in my ribs and when i go Ouch! that hurts! he says nonchalantly ""that's good, it's not your heart or your lungs, but JUST a muscle spasm!"" Three weeks later, at infusion no. 8, I made nurse aware that it still hurts very much and she said oh, these muscle spasms can last very long. It even hurts when i inhale deeply. Saw my regular doctor, who is an internal med specialist, and he thinks it's a ligament between ribs. Mammogram of left breast last week says all is fine. My, I am wordy today! But I have been worrying, and at last I can share my rationale with Herceptin sisters as to why I decided to quit halfway. My heart ejection fraction has steadily been drifting down from 70, it was 54 3 weeks ago after 3-monthly echo. So it suddenly dawned on me that I am convinced that the eight 3-weekly Herceptin treatments that I've had is ENOUGH FOR ME. My tumor was stage 1, and sentinel node plus one more were clear. I called onc nurse to schedule appntmnt with onc at my #9 infusion, and told her my thoughts. She said, talk to doc, here he is. I explained myself, and asked him to confirm whether any other studies had been done re. number of treatments necessary for early stage bc. He said there has been a study showing that 6 treatments are beneficial. He then asked ""how many have you had?"" I said 8, and he said ""okay, you can stop, and we'll cancel your no. 9 infusion for this Friday."" Wow. Just like that. I was a little shocked, as i had emotionally prepared me for having the ninth one, and seeing it as a mile-post ""halfway"". Onc wants to see me again in 3 months. So now i have an appointment with the surgeon, who will remove my port as an outpatient procedure, and then i can probably quit the Coumadin, and then . perhaps the ""spasm"" thing will slowly fade away. I hope. And the joint pain and exacerbated arthritis (I'm really only 63, but the past year I went from feeling like a young 62, to very old 63 :-) Lastly, I sort of feel (my own emotional feeling) that by letting the port go I am manifesting my belief that I will not need it again.

"811b98a3-848a-4cb6-95bd-9f2b25455fa4","Hi TX66, I am new to this site. and am being treated for TN IDC, Stage II, Grade 3. I have been receiving TAC since 4/2/08 every 3 weeks. After round 3 developed fever (over 101), cough and shortness of breath. Was hospitalized and worked up by Infectious Disease and Pulmonologist who found ""ground glass"" infliltrates on chest CT.(Have any of you with shortness of breath had a chest CT?). the long and short of it is it occurred again after round 4 and I was started on prednisone 60mg/day for at least 3 weeks. The docs all believe I have had a rare SE of the taxotere. Round 5 and 6 are AC only. Just finished # 5 1 week ago. Have had many of the other SE mentioned: foul tasting mouth, few mouth sores, nose sores, mild fingernail changes, NO nausea ~ take Emend, profound fatigue, very low WBC counts, immediate menopause (age 48) with accompanying hot flashes, general deconditioning, consitpation, heartburn (Use Prilosec OTC with good result).

Almost no nausea, some fatigue but notlike I feared. Its been alittle scary because I keep waiting for that ""Im a cancer patient "" feeling. I'm not complaining. As for the pain in ovaries I cant say I've felt any but be sure to talk to your dc about it. Ive gained 11 pounds and I hate that but dc says its from the steroids.

Furthermore, taxanes administered once per week or once every three weeks were equally effective. These results were recently presented at the 28th annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) in December 2005. AC followed by a taxane is a commonly used adjuvant therapeutic regimen for the treatment of localized breast cancer. Research continues into comparing Taxotere to Taxol in its efficacy, as well as different scheduling of administration of these agents. The ECOG E1199 trial that was recently presented at SABCS included nearly 5,000 women with node-positive or high-risk node-negative breast cancer who received four cycles of standard AC, and were randomized to receive one of the following: Taxotere once weekly or once every three weeks; Taxol once weekly or once every three weeks. Overall, no significant differences were noted at 4 years. * Taxol every three weeks: disease-free survival (DFS) was 80.6% and overall survival (OS) was 88.8% * Taxol once per week: DFS was 83.5% and OS was 91.8% * Taxotere every three weeks: DFS was 83.1% and OS was 89.3% * Taxotere once per week: DFS was 80.5% and OS was 88.9% Grade III and IV adverse events occurred in 30% of patients treated in the every three week Taxol arm, 28% of patients in the once per week Taxol arm, 71% of patients in the every three week Taxotere arm, and 45% of patients in the once per week Taxotere arm. There was more febrile neutropenia and infection in the every three week Taxotere arm. The researchers stated that the trials data monitoring committee allowed early release of these results as there appeared to be no likelihood that these numbers would change with longer follow-up.

It looks fairly natural and I even things up with Q-tips if I get too wide or whatever. I don't have a cure for no eyelashes and have never worn false ones, so will just do without. Hope that you all have a good week.","been","andhav","138","IN","106","experienc","neuropathi","111","taxol","148","3","IN","too","0","experienc","PRP$","1","VBN","andhav","am","VBG","been","drug-SE","on","NN","FALSE","finger","RB","NNS","NN","in","neuropathy","NN","VBG","my","Taxol","false","1","VBN","NNP","0","false","2","valid","VBP","25","83","44","25","1","1","9","25","131","9","25","131"

My sister was on tamoxifen and her only side effect was hot flashes and some weight gain. They were not severe so hopefully yours won't be either. D1 - thanks for the rads tip. The rad tech did assure me it won't be as long as the rads sim. Thank God! Paula - loved the pics! Did you go for your rads simulation yet? Tina - Robin Roberts from GMA found her cancer from a lump and then went to get it checked (last summer). Like mine, it did not show up on a mammogram but on the ultrasound. It was early stage and she had a lumpectomy, chemo 8X, and rads. She is done with treatment now. It didn't say whether she was on hormone blockers. Her hair is growing in but very short. She is very brave and had her hair shaved on TV before losing it to chemo. She's worn a wig everyday until last week. I watch GMA everyday so I have followed her journey sort of as a role model. She has hardly missed a day of work! Very inspiring and encouraging for me. I'll bet she writes a book. I'll be the first to buy it!

"8480921c-b22c-4ce7-be68-662f990c4fa1","Hi all, I was diagnosed at age 43 with ILC at Stage IV. It had spread to my peritineum and bones. It has progressed to my liver and I have had ascities at presentation and through the years but I am feeling great right now. I thought a recap of my history may be helpful. Finished my last chemo 3 weeks ago (adriamycin cytoxan, whew, that was a very tough one) but my tumor markers have gone down almost 70% since June when I was one very sick puppy. Here is a recap of treatments as best as I can remember with chemo brain. Taxotere - worked - 8 treatments Arimidex - worked for a year Aromosin - did not work Faslodex - one shot - worked for 5 months Androxy - male hormones - worked for 9 months but had hair in very weird places, gained a hell of a lot of weight, and wanted to watch football and drink beer - no kidding!!! Estrodial - did not work Xeloda - so hard on me and didn't work - 4 months Naturapathic IV's - worked for 9 months!!!! Just antioxidant IV's and some Ozone therapy. - felt great! But then progressed Halavan - stablized but didn't work very well - 5 months Faslodex - double shot - worked for about 5 months Abraxane - kept it stable for a while, 5 months and then progressed Navelbine - only 6 weeks and markers and symtoms went crazy! Ended up in hospital Then a/c in June until now Now, doing Oncomar (a naturapathic fermented wheat germ) with Aromasin for 2 months and will get tumor markers then. If not stable, will go on Afinitor. Hoping this works. This is the pill form of Avemar. Anyone else doing this, did this? Oncomar costs $139 a month from my Naturapath. Also, I started disgusting tasting Chinese Herbs about 5 weeks ago which has given me amazing energy! I go to Dr. Kamto Lee in Portland, OR. And have been doing reiki too for over 2 years. Helps keep my head on straight. Try to eat healthy but probably cheat at least 30% of the time! Hard with 2 teenage girls at home! So there you have it! Didn't think that I would live to see my girls to high school, but here I am still! And even went out to eat this weekend at a Thai restaurant and did fine! And try to laugh and love sicko humor!

They never mentioned it, just tamoxefin. I did have ice chips during the session, and lots of water. i have 2 mouth sores though. For right now, they are not a real problem. I really have felt pretty good for the last couple of days, I don't think that i realized that there would be some days of relief in between treatments. this is a good thing. My good friend at work is having a big 40th B-day party in the city this Saturday night. There will be lots of people in a big bar. This will be day 12 for me when the blood counts dip.

I have done extensive research on so much of this bc business since my dx 9/29/11. I teach at a university so I hope that maybe gives me a bit of credibility--I feel like I've already gotten my PhD in BC though! I'm here to help. BTW my BC is ILC, 2 c. lumpectomy with clear margins (close but clear), 6 positive nodes, grade 1 st. II. I'm ER/PR+ and HER2 -. All chemo's done. On to radiation next and BMX recon (later). I had AC DD x 4 followed by Taxol x12 (12 weeks). I did not use the cold caps b/c of expense. I start tamoxifen in a week. Dealing with nurses, doctors, chemo-brain, fatigue, SE, fear. I do have experience. You have to ice DURING infusion. Believe it or not I just used bags of frozen peas to ice; someone else on this discussion board suggested it to me. My husband brought them in a small cooler--a six pack cooler--with one of those frozen ice packs. We put them in the nurses fridge. When I knew the Taxol was coming, he went and got them. We had transferred them into 4 ziplock bags before we left for chemo. I opened two and stuck my hands up to my nails in each one--one on each side, in my chemo chair. The other two I squeezed the air out of and put them on the ends of my feet. I wrapped a blanket around my legs to help hold them. The first taxol took about 2 hours--they drip it slowly to avoid any possible reactions. By taxol #3 I was down to an hour. I kept icing for as long as I could stand it--then took a short break--about one song on my i-pod! But I kept at it, and my nails now look the same as they always did. No damage at all. I also periodically took one of the bags off my feet and held it to my eyes--thinking that it was like a ""cold cap"" kind of tx. My eyebrows and lashes thinned, but I didn't lose them completely. I don't know of anyone else who iced their eyes--so I might have been the first. Icing isn't very comfortable, but I thought if I could stand it for such a short time it was worth it to keep my nails, eyebrows and lashes. Losing my hair was bad enough. You can re-use the peas if you keep them in the zippies and re-freeze them when you get home.

"881e918a-a3bc-41f7-a409-bb855fd7f241","Oh Vicky. I didn't read through everyone else's posts, because I have little ones and just find it hard to delve through. But I did skim through and read all of yours. You have a lot on your plate - a large family, the loss of your mother, difficulties with your husband, feeling like cr*p with chemo and all of it's side effects and working on top of it all. Yes, surprising, but you do find out who really cares and who runs for the hills when you have cancer and need help. I know on your last post you said that you will not do the last Taxol - I think that is your choice and it is for you and your doctor to decide. If you do decide to go through with it, maybe try Neupogen shots instead of Neulasta. It will require more shots - usually 2-3 versus the one you would take of Neulasta, but it is a bit more mild. I remember the days of chemo. and yes, I did lose my toenails (just 2 of them. although my pinky toenails are so small, I think they may have come off without me noticing!) - but that was with AC not the Taxol. It did take a while for my body to feel back to normal after the chemo - body aches are common. Body image issues are common. You are SO NOT ALONE. I wish I could just reach through this keyboard and give you a nice big hug. Please try to hang in there.

My depression started recently. was diagnosed 6 months ago. I feel guilty because my treatment did not include (thank God) any chemo or radiation, just bilateral mastectomy, tissue expanders, reconstruction and tamoxifen. I feel guilty because so many women have to suffer thru chemo and radiation, I don't have the right to be depressed. Am I crazy? I went into overdrive when diagnosed, flew thru the mastectomy, suffered thru the tissue expanders, and the reconstruction surgery was a breeze (just 3 weeks ago). So, why I am falling apart now? I am full of anxiety and fear of the cancer returning (although my Onco type score indicates only 20% chance). I never took time for myself to deal with my diagnosis during the last 6 months, went back towork too soon after the mastectomy,faked a ""light hearted"" attitude aboutmy cancerwith family and friends. So, is that why I'm in this dark dark place now? Has anyone else experienced this? Am I crazy? Of course there are other factors that may be contributing. Iwas the primary caretaker for my dad when he had cancer and then passed away, shortly thereafter mom was diagnosed with dementia and I took care of her for 5 years. I was diagnosed with BC just 9 months after she passed, I hadn't healed emotionally from her passing. During the sametime I had to deal with a husband who was unfaithful. So, did I have too much on my plate and now it's hitting me? I guess I just want toknow if my deep depression is justified, or am I just a big baby and need to ""deal with it"" ? Good luck to all of you and thank you for listening.","antidepress","and","243","VBD","177","which","depress","186","tamoxifen","253","11","DT","interact","0","my","RB","2","IN","me","between","PRP$","on","drug-SE","the","PRP","FALSE","NULL","NN","NULL","NN","start","depression","CC","WDT","recent","tamoxifen","false","2","NNS","NN","0","false","4","valid","IN","1","123","142","102","72","80","25","78","131","44","25","1"

"8bede3e3-8316-4870-bac8-1da5fc8ba440","Maybe I just stupid anddidn't question the SEs that went along with the hormonal treatments because I honestly did not even realize that some of the things I felt were due to medications. I was able to get up and go to work and do most of the things I always did so was happy with that. Also I did not have any issues with libido or sex until just a few years ago. I thought I had arthritis for a long time and actually took meds for it. I also had carpal tunnel which I had the surgery for, but I did test positive when they tested me for it and it is a condition that a lot of hygienists develop since our work is repetative action. My onco told me what he was recommending, I filled the Rxs and took the medications and prayed they would work. I went into instant menopause with tamoxifen, had the night sweats, gained weight, found I was unable to bend and stretch like I used to do and actually got rid of a car because it was so difficult for me to get in and out of. I just accepted all of this because it was not something I couldn't live with and my tumor markers went down, the scans showed great improvement and I was in remission for many years. almost 10. When one drug stopped working we moved onto another. this was all being done as treatment after I became Stage lV, not preventative. I often wonder if I had done tamoxifen as preventative after my original diagnosis and mastectomy, if I possibly would have avoided Stage lV. but it does no good to look back. Did tamox, arimidex. aromasin and faslodex and because of these drugs was able to avoid chemo for 10 years. Any SEs I had in those 10 years were nothing at all compared to the SEs that I had with chemo.

"8d7c7506-8118-4dc0-b72b-0d8138801d90","Hi Blumberm, I had the same situation with my Taxotere. I had worsening neuropathy with each treatment, and ended up not getting the 3rd of 4 because of it (I also had 4 DD A/C before the Taxotere, which is closely related to Taxol). I definitely understand your concern about missing a dose! The good news in my case is that the neuropathy is nearly gone now. I still have a hint of it in my hands/feet, especially when I'm on the computer or standing on my feet for a long time, but it's nothing like it was and it's really only barely noticeable. Hopefully you'll have the same success. How severe is your neuropathy? Mine was fairly significant and actually affected some of my activities of daily living - it was hard to pick up small things and I had a lot of numbness that made things difficult, so for me the onc said the very small percentage of potential benefit was likely not worth the risk of increasing the side effects that were already evident and worsening. My oncologist recommended glutamine and B vitamins to try to mediate the neuropathy side effects - have you asked about supplements that may help?

Hi LilPaws! Sounds like generally speaking you are doing better? Hope that tumor just shrinks on it's own. Could it be something like a Carcinoid tumor? LOVE that Dutchess! Hah! The best place to fall, if you have to do it, are out in the garden, or out in a snow bank. I've done them both. Just something soft to land on. Not long after I fell and broke my femur, I fell OUT of the tub! Hah! I caught my bad foot on the hose going up to the shower head, and it held on, and I went down with a splat! DH came running in, because my hand hit the door, but I got up on my own. just a few cuts from the connections on the hose. It's just EASY to fall. gotta pay more attention when taking those steps. It got up to 100 on our back patio yesterday! Just have to stay in when it's that hot. Janie said it was hot AND humid there you Florida gals. But she loves it! Morning Blondie. How are you doing? Marla, it's always fun to read your posts. about your dog! Hah! Poor thing. Yeah, when their toe-nails grow so long, it makes their foot walk different. Whenever I took Lacee for anything, I had them trim her nails. Yes. HAPPY ANNIVERSARY TANG! I forgot to say that earlier. Hey HiHo! You know, I think everybody is different, when taking any of those drugs. When I took Tamoxifen, I did FINE, until I lost my hearing. And our ""stages"" are different, along with everything else. Even the node involvement. Our whole genetic make-up is different, and even our Doctors. Just research everything you can find, and then you can maybe compare your symptoms on a certain drug, but I figure I will TRY something, see how it goes, and if it don't work out, I can try something else. or not. Jazzy, we saw a guy playing a ""steel drum"" or ""pan"" when we were by the beach near Singer Island. I LOVE that sound. Sort of like a Marimba, and xylophone combined. I had never seen this before. but it has a beautiful sound. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woBZME7sN3ESmarty, the stupidest thing anyone said to me was right after I told her I was taking ""Tamoxifen"" so my chances would be better for not getting cancer again. SHE said. ""So does that mean you will be growing hair on your face? ""That brainless friend thought Tamoxifen was Testosterone. I mean she is older than ME! And she said something that stupid!

"8f225d00-a84e-4f00-ad73-3a55b9a98100","Jennywren, I second the don't give up. Steroids seem a bit dramatic for pain. it does sound a bit like the pain is caused by nerve damage. My pcp told me radiation was very hard on the body. but my rad onc didn't stress this. I have found that protecting the affected side is most important. I am a nurse and I try to make sure I do not lift patients with my left arm. but I have found that even everyday activities leave the arm in pain. A good rest is crucial for me as well. and the massage is good. I do a gentle palpation of the breast while I am lying in bed at night, my breast and arm and ribs are usually very sore by the time I go to bed. and this week I have dabbed a little tincture of Iodine around the breast, (I have read that tincture of Iodine applied to women with fibrocystic breast helps alleviate fibrocystic breast and softens them.and the onc nurse practicioner didn't discourage this when I told her I was doing this.) and My breast are softer in the morning. the surgery and the rads, removal of lymph node etc, tend to cause drainage problems within the breast, causing the pain and swelling. Also benadryl has helped me sleep better at night, so I am getting the rest. After rads and while I was taking tamoxifen, I kept a diary of all the pains or unusual things I felt. Even the time of day you notice the pain more may give youa clue how to manage the pain.

Amanda was so happy we came, and it was a very nice event, proceeds went to the Canadian Cancer Society - I think they raised over $15,000. This morning we had a Bar Mitzvah and it was a friggin' blizzard out - luckily the synagogue was close, and once we got in it was a nice morning/afternoon - too much food, we really veered off our South Beach diet, but hey, tomorrow is another day (right, Scarlett? )Debbie - you look fabulous in your pictures, along with SIL, DH and the kids are adorable. Tina - sounds like Jaclyn and Paul are having alot of fun in the snow and with their friends. When are you going to DC? How far is the drive? Nice of the new office group to get that cake for your DH - it must have lifted his spirits. Melia - Yes it seems we have alot of angst here, but as Mel said because of our situation, ages etc. I'm also not surprised. Don't be disheartened by what doc # 3 said about your DH's prognosis - didn't the other 2 sound more positive? Wait for the path. etc. - and the Ta Tas will be right there with you.

But reading all your updates has kept me going :)Had my 'last' AC treatment the day after Christmas (it was so rough. so so rough. that damn AC ) only to see my MO three weeks later and have him tell me I needed more chemo. Ugh. I was so relieved to be done with chemo and had been meeting surgeons in prep for my mastectomy. I was even starting to taste food again and feel like me. Needless to say, it was a blow. The good news is that my lump is completely gone - onc can't even feel where it was. But because it grew on the Taxol, I'd technically only had the 4 AC tx. So he asked colleagues and such and they all agreed on more chemo, esp since I'm only 35 and am BRACA 1. Sigh. So, he started me on Carboplatin and Gemzar since they are great for TNBC and BRACA. He didn't want to risk the heart damage with more AC. I also think he knew I might have refused if he recommended more AC. That last one almost broke me. Anyone have experience with Carbo? I find it easier than AC but still pretty rough. The nausea lasts for a week :( The Carbo also devastates my counts, so I had to get a Neulasta on Monday and the bone pain just hit me today along with the head cold my son, my fianc, and his mom have been suffering from all week. Double sigh. I'm on one week Carbo and Gemzar, second week just Gemzar, and third week off. Rinse and repeat. 2 maybe 3 more times. I'm just having a hard time because I was mentally done with chemo and preparing for my surgery.

So far the best advise Ive read is from Cheyenna, who finished her AC x4 and Taxol x12 on Nov 1, 2010 and didnt experience any side effects. 1. Please stay on top of your meds! !, you want to take them before you feel any pain or nausea because it is tougher to catch up after the symptoms appear. You may be very blessed and you will not have any side effects thru 16 treatments. Take what you need to take to get you through this and let the chemo do its job, don't fight it, go with it. ! Remember, you are doing this to kick cancer cell ass. It really does get better. 2. Water,water,water You want to keep your kidneys and liver flushed. Drink a lot of water while being infused. You will pee red and you want the red gone before you go home, AC is hard core ONC's call it the (Red Devil), been around for 30 years. Flush twice with the lid down. I am not sure but I think the half life on the Adriamycin is about 28 hours and the Cytoxin is about 17 hours, and its out, but lots of fluids. 3. You would also have the famous Chemo Fatigue, third chemo is the worst! It really helps to get up and take a walk and a shower. If you r so fatigued that you cant, pop an Ativan and sleep through it, dont fight it. Listen to your body. 4. Take Aleve before the neulasta shot and 24 hours later. Although, if you get sick it will come out in a fever, you wont get sick like a non chemo person cause you do not have a lot of cells to fight it off. Keep an eye on you temp, if you think something is going on, and if you r not good, dont take a Aleve or Tylenol, it can mask the fever. No fresh fruit or veggies, they are touched all the time, you never know. 5. Taxol is a piece of cake compared to AC, Taxol does not hit your white cells or red like AC, you will have much more energy, but it is also are very famous for bone, joint pain and the dreaded neuropathy. Take glutaminein powder form,1 tablespoon 3 times a day in about 4 inches of water the day after infusion for four days and B6 and B12 6. Never get mouth sores. Gargled w/ the salt water and baking soda 3 time a day. Do it all thru chemo everyday. For very drying nails used nail oil, not hardener, you want them moist. 7.

So far the best advise Ive read is from Cheyenna, who finished her AC x4 and Taxol x12 on Nov 1, 2010 and didnt experience any side effects. 1. Please stay on top of your meds! !, you want to take them before you feel any pain or nausea because it is tougher to catch up after the symptoms appear. You may be very blessed and you will not have any side effects thru 16 treatments. Take what you need to take to get you through this and let the chemo do its job, don't fight it, go with it. ! Remember, you are doing this to kick cancer cell ass. It really does get better. 2. Water,water,water You want to keep your kidneys and liver flushed. Drink a lot of water while being infused. You will pee red and you want the red gone before you go home, AC is hard core ONC's call it the (Red Devil), been around for 30 years. Flush twice with the lid down. I am not sure but I think the half life on the Adriamycin is about 28 hours and the Cytoxin is about 17 hours, and its out, but lots of fluids. 3. You would also have the famous Chemo Fatigue, third chemo is the worst! It really helps to get up and take a walk and a shower. If you r so fatigued that you cant, pop an Ativan and sleep through it, dont fight it. Listen to your body. 4. Take Aleve before the neulasta shot and 24 hours later. Although, if you get sick it will come out in a fever, you wont get sick like a non chemo person cause you do not have a lot of cells to fight it off. Keep an eye on you temp, if you think something is going on, and if you r not good, dont take a Aleve or Tylenol, it can mask the fever. No fresh fruit or veggies, they are touched all the time, you never know. 5. Taxol is a piece of cake compared to AC, Taxol does not hit your white cells or red like AC, you will have much more energy, but it is also are very famous for bone, joint pain and the dreaded neuropathy. Take glutaminein powder form,1 tablespoon 3 times a day in about 4 inches of water the day after infusion for four days and B6 and B12 6. Never get mouth sores. Gargled w/ the salt water and baking soda 3 time a day. Do it all thru chemo everyday. For very drying nails used nail oil, not hardener, you want them moist. 7.

Surgeon said the fluid would get absorbed. It did. I would love Vegas in the Spring. Any dates are good with me. I hear ya about the ""Gee you look so good with your short hair. Are you going to keep it short?"" I just want to GAG!!!! It was an ugly gray. It is now a little red and about 1.5 inches long. It is also curly? What's up with that? I've never had curly hair that wasn't due to a perm. I figure the curls won't last long, so, for now, I'm just letting it grow. Had a *cyst* drained in my good boob. Pathology came back as abnormal cells (not cancer). On Aug 2nd, I go back under the knife to have the *cyst* removed because after is was drained, two weeks later it was back. Surgeon says with my history it's best to get it out. Had my first colonospcy. I promised my mom before she died of colon cancer last year that I would get one. They found one small polop that was b9. Had my first pap. It came back abnormal cells too. Off to gyn. He's in a *wait and see* mode. Nothing to really remove or do anything about except watch. I go back for another pap in 6 months. Oh gee, what fun. The night sweats were kicking my butt. Onc put me on Effexor. I'm not happy taking an antidepressant, but it did help with the night sweats. I occasionally get power surges, but, nothing to get excited about. I found going without a hat or wig so LIBERATING!!! I enjoy life in a more relaxed mode now. Alot of little things that would drive me nuts before are a nothing now that I don't even acknowledge. This last year sure has changed life priorities for me. I need to lose weight but either the Tamox or the Effexor makes me lethargic and turns me into a couch potato. I don't seem to have the get-up-and-go like I did before the bc. I'm hoping that after a while, I'll get used to the meds and will be able to counter-act the laziness. I did find a product called Chillow Pillow to help with the hot nights. Found it at Walgreens. After the first night, I bought one for my cuz. She loves it now too. By the sounds of it, everyone is getting some normalcy back into their lives. I do have one question. After all the treatments & meds, is anyone experiencing a ringing in their ears? Over the last couple of weeks, I've got this ringing and I haven't a clue what may be causing it. I checked the Tamox & Effexor and neither lists ringing in the ears as a side-effect. It's been REALLY HOT here in Phoenix. Makes the night sweats a bit tougher than normal. Well, off to bed. I'll check in from time to time to see how ya'll are doing. You all have been such a source of comfort & support. I know I could NOT have survived all this without you.

"9bc3aedc-5851-4f00-b66b-4111c9871000","Thank you for your post. There are different chemotherapy drugs to treat breast cancer, but they do not all do the same thing. That is why a combination of different drugs are chosen. You need to talk this over with your oncologist. From my experience the oncologist will look at your case and then tell you what chemotherapy drugs he/she has chosen for you. You are quite at liberty to ask why particular drugs have been chosen. I remember very clearly that I made an appointment to see my oncologist before deciding on my chemotherapy and she told me the drugs that I would be having. She told me that they would be cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), epirubicin (Ellence) and docetaxel (Taxotere). She further explained that I would have the cyclophosphamide and epirubicin together, intravenously, every three weeks for the first three months. After that I would have the docetaxel, on its own, every three weeks for three months. Cyclophosphamide and epirubicin are very common chemotherapy drugs in the treatment of breast cancer. Docetaxel was one of the newer drugs at the time in 2005 and belongs to the group of drugs known as taxanes. Sometimes doxorubicin (Adriamycin) which belongs to the same group as epirubicin may be used. Sometimes paclitaxel (Taxol) which belongs to the same group as docetaxel may be used. I did ask my oncologist why she had chosen docetaxel instead of paclitaxel and she said it was less harsh on the heart. Cyclophosphamide is known as an alkylating agent and two of its side effects are hair loss, and suppress the immune system. Docetaxel and paclitaxel are known as antimitotics and can cause the same side effects as the alkylating agents. Doxorubicin and epirubicin are known as topoisomerase inhibitors and also have the same side effects as alkylating agents. Doxorubicin can cause heart dameage. Although these chemotherapy drugs have similar side effects, they work in different ways. I know from reading some of the posts on these threads that other women have had different combinations. For example, some may have had three combinations known as FEC (fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide) and then paclitaxel or docetaxel. As you see from FernMF's post, she had docetaxel (Taxotere) and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan). Her oncologist decided not to give her a third one because of its problems with the heart muscle. Your oncologist will decide what she thinks is best for you. Some women have different time-scales and may have weekly treatment instead of every three weeks. Your oncologist should also tell you what the likely side effects will be. Although we have more or less the same drugs, we all react differently and we all have different side effects. For example, I never had any sign of nausea or vomiting. I was not affected by the steroids. My main problem was feeling more tired than usual. I would think that the most common side effect is hair loss and that happens pretty quickly after the first treatment. To get through chemotherapy you need to take special care of yourself, drink plenty of water after treatment and throughout treatment, get plenty of rest and eat as healthily as you can in small doses. You will find that you can get through chemotherapy, even though it is very time consuming, and you will not necessarily have some of the nasty side effects that other women experience. I took no pills during treatment other than the ones given at the oncology clinic for the three days after each treatment. If you feel nauseous, natural products such as peppermint tea, ginger tea or ginger root cut up in hot water can help. Canned pineapple in its own juice can refresh a dry mouth. If you have a problem there is always a way to overcome it. Before you start your chemotherapy, at least this was my experience, you will have an appointment with chemotherapy staff who will talk to you and check certain things, such as blood pressure. Before you start your chemotherapy you will be weighed and checked for height, because the amount of drug you receive depends on these two things. Before each treatment you will have had a blood test to make sure that everything is in order before you get the chemotherapy drug. Levels of red and white blood cells are especially important. I hope this information helps.

"9bc3aedc-5851-4f00-b66b-4111c9871000","Thank you for your post. There are different chemotherapy drugs to treat breast cancer, but they do not all do the same thing. That is why a combination of different drugs are chosen. You need to talk this over with your oncologist. From my experience the oncologist will look at your case and then tell you what chemotherapy drugs he/she has chosen for you. You are quite at liberty to ask why particular drugs have been chosen. I remember very clearly that I made an appointment to see my oncologist before deciding on my chemotherapy and she told me the drugs that I would be having. She told me that they would be cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), epirubicin (Ellence) and docetaxel (Taxotere). She further explained that I would have the cyclophosphamide and epirubicin together, intravenously, every three weeks for the first three months. After that I would have the docetaxel, on its own, every three weeks for three months. Cyclophosphamide and epirubicin are very common chemotherapy drugs in the treatment of breast cancer. Docetaxel was one of the newer drugs at the time in 2005 and belongs to the group of drugs known as taxanes. Sometimes doxorubicin (Adriamycin) which belongs to the same group as epirubicin may be used. Sometimes paclitaxel (Taxol) which belongs to the same group as docetaxel may be used. I did ask my oncologist why she had chosen docetaxel instead of paclitaxel and she said it was less harsh on the heart. Cyclophosphamide is known as an alkylating agent and two of its side effects are hair loss, and suppress the immune system. Docetaxel and paclitaxel are known as antimitotics and can cause the same side effects as the alkylating agents. Doxorubicin and epirubicin are known as topoisomerase inhibitors and also have the same side effects as alkylating agents. Doxorubicin can cause heart dameage. Although these chemotherapy drugs have similar side effects, they work in different ways. I know from reading some of the posts on these threads that other women have had different combinations. For example, some may have had three combinations known as FEC (fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide) and then paclitaxel or docetaxel. As you see from FernMF's post, she had docetaxel (Taxotere) and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan). Her oncologist decided not to give her a third one because of its problems with the heart muscle. Your oncologist will decide what she thinks is best for you. Some women have different time-scales and may have weekly treatment instead of every three weeks. Your oncologist should also tell you what the likely side effects will be. Although we have more or less the same drugs, we all react differently and we all have different side effects. For example, I never had any sign of nausea or vomiting. I was not affected by the steroids. My main problem was feeling more tired than usual. I would think that the most common side effect is hair loss and that happens pretty quickly after the first treatment. To get through chemotherapy you need to take special care of yourself, drink plenty of water after treatment and throughout treatment, get plenty of rest and eat as healthily as you can in small doses. You will find that you can get through chemotherapy, even though it is very time consuming, and you will not necessarily have some of the nasty side effects that other women experience. I took no pills during treatment other than the ones given at the oncology clinic for the three days after each treatment. If you feel nauseous, natural products such as peppermint tea, ginger tea or ginger root cut up in hot water can help. Canned pineapple in its own juice can refresh a dry mouth. If you have a problem there is always a way to overcome it. Before you start your chemotherapy, at least this was my experience, you will have an appointment with chemotherapy staff who will talk to you and check certain things, such as blood pressure. Before you start your chemotherapy you will be weighed and checked for height, because the amount of drug you receive depends on these two things. Before each treatment you will have had a blood test to make sure that everything is in order before you get the chemotherapy drug. Levels of red and white blood cells are especially important. I hope this information helps.

Been taking it at night and am gonna skip before bed and see what happens when I take it with breakfast. This same thing happened with Arimidex. If this is a no go, I will call my onc and see him after the holidays. My next step is Tamoxifen. This is sooooo frustrating.

I already had 12 chemo treatments of AC, Taxol and MF, and radiation, so my Onc told me to quit the Arimidex, because of some annoying side effects. namely generally feeling out of it and neck joints popping. not serious SE's but annoying none the less. I've been off for a few weeks, and feel a lot better. A lot more in control, no more running my mouth and mind constantly. a lot more relaxed. I joined the Y a couple of months ago, and working on mainly weight training to build up strength. I haven't lost many lbs., but clothes are looser and feel so much stronger. Also taking calcium and magnesium and a multivitamin supplement (different time of day) to get rid of my palptitations. I've only been doing that for a few days, but see an improvement already.","of","becaus","275","NULL","175","some","pop","183","arimidex","282","15","DT","to","0","joint","NULL","4","NN","and","quit","NNS","neck","drug-SE","the","CC","FALSE","NULL","TO","NULL","VBG","NULL","popping","IN","DT","NULL","Arimidex","false","2","IN","NNP","0","false","7","valid","VB","1","1","8","80","80","80","8","8","1","25","120","120"

It's been almost 6 months since I finished chemo and during treatment I was strict about taking my vitamin & meds. Oh well I take my tamoxifen as instructed, but big bad Ann let the B6 vitamins fall to the side. I had neuropathy during chemo & the B vitamins work. Omg after all of this time my leg is tingling again just like during chemo. Of course my nurse asked if I was still taking the vitamins. I have an appt next week but I've started back and hopefully it helps like it did before. I guess I got cocky & thought I was 100%. Ohhhh good news. I had a bilateral last yr & did most of last yrs with no nipples (TMI?) anyway I had my nip recon in Dec & had slight complications but ladies, tonight I got out the shower and for the first time since 12/12/12 I didn't frown. My girls look damn good. I had some skin peeling & slight necrosis (enough to depress the hell out of me) but they look good now. It's been over a month. Perky. My skin is healing. I'm so excited I stood in the mirror posing!! Now if only I can ease the nerve damage in my leg from making me limp. I can't win for losing. But I'll take the limp any day.

I've only had neulasta (when I initially did ACT) and although I did have pain for a few days after each shot, I was able to take care of it with Advil so I never tried the Claritin. My main side effect with Halaven seems to be the lower leg swelling which I'm dealing with by taking a diuretic daily. I also just noticed that my arms seem to be falling asleep more often and I wonder if that's the beginning of an issue with neuropathy. I need to pay more attention to taking the L-Glutamine. And, of course, my hair continues to thin. Thankfully, I love the wig I got although I'm noticing I'm feeling hotter wearing it as the temperatures warm up. These side effects aren't bad right now and I'm more than willing to put up with them since the Halaven definitely seems to be working for me. I continue to feel better (after a lot of back and hip pain in February and March) and my tumor markers continue to drop (first from 1071 to 416 and now down to 202).","to","seem","329","WDT","299","be","leg","306","halaven","341","5","IN","side","0","lower","PRP","12","DT","be","effect","JJR","the","drug-SE","with","VB","FALSE","'m","NN","VBP","NN","which","leg swelling","VBZ","VB","i","Halaven","false","1","TO","NNP","0","false","6","valid","NN","8","131","1","131","44","-1","1","8","8","8","1","131"

"a4d604ac-92df-4110-985c-7891466c0a40","Packergirl. YAY!! It is such a relief to hear your awesome experience!!!! What an inspiration to others!! I am wondering though why your ps put in the smaller implants. It sound slike all of the surgeries this last week were all successes!! WOO HOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!! I post mostly on the tata site and they know what's been going on with me, but I thought I would post here in hopes it may help somebody else. I had nipple sparing mastecomy and didn't mind the expanders at all! IN fact I loved waking up with breasts!! I think it made a huge difference in my recovery. I had to go through chemo and herceptin. Jan was my last chemo treatment and my wbc was so low and I developed cellulitis on my left breast. I was hospitalised asap and was in there for 4 days yuck!! I had my exchange March 10th. it felt wonderful, right after the exchange I developed cellulitis for the 2nd time. urgh. I was also very depressed about the size of my new girls. I wanted to be the same size as I was before or at least close to that, plus my nipples hadn't recovered as expected. I would go inmy closet and just bawl. :-( My skin was so thin and it kept ripping (the skin under my nipples). I would go in and have my ps sew me up. after the 3rd time being sewn up my ps looked into my eyes and said. you haven't been happy since day 1 and I want to make you happy. So he said he could do a lat flap which would bring more blood supply to my breasts which will totally help my skin to grow tissue and make the skin thicker and he could put in bigger implants. Anyway. I ended up having a lat flap done on both sides May 26th. I've got to tell you it was the most difficult surgery to recover from, and I have had 4 surgeries in this past year. It was nice to have a back lift and get rid of my back fat!! Woo Hoo!!! :-) I right away developed a capsular contracture. urgh!! I worked on it and so did my ps. squeezing and sqeezing. I should have gone and used the mammogram machine!! Anyway the constant squeesing really helped and it broke up a bit. I couldn't have any surgeries for a while since I had had so many. So I waited until my surgery in Oct. I had an abdominal hysterectomy/ooph. plus a new implant on the left side with some pocket revisions. I developed cellulitis for the 3rd time on this left breast!! URGH!! It still isn't as soft as my right foob and hasn't dropped like it either, but with physical therapy it has been getting better!!! I highly recommend physical therapy! It has helped tremendously! Last Wed Dec 2nd, I had my very last treatment/herceptin!! WOO HOO!!! It has been a long 14 months with cellulitis 3 times and 4 surgeries. urgh anyway I have been having breathing problems and when I went in for my treatment my blood pressure was way low and my blood test was off a bit, so my onc ordered a ct scan. I went last thurs then fri saw my onc for the results. He said that they found a nodule on my left lower lobe of my lung. He also said that I had one in Jan and it hasn't change and they are both very small. He said that he didn't think it was cancer. OK I just about freaked. to hear the word CANCER! When I got home I thought. what just happened??? The appt was all such a fog. He referred me to a pulmonologist to have it all checked out. I went yesterday and she had acted like. why are you here kind of thing. Once I started talking she realized that I am more than concerned about getting cancer again! HER2+ has a high risk of reacurring cancer in other parts of the body and I was freaked!! So she explained that the nodules are very small and way too small to biopsy. She also said all we can do is do a ct scan every 3 to 6 months and watch them. She really made me feel like it's no big deal. but she told me that I have 5 nodules not 2!! URGH!! I am relieved but will always be concerned about reacurring cancer. I hear it gets better. STAY STRONG MY TATA SISTERS!! WE WILL SURVIVE!! I love you girls and even though I don't post often please know I pray for all of you daily and send hope and a lot of faith. HUGS!!

I think my biggest complaint has to be the lower lower like into my tailbone back pain and shoulder blade pain but I'm wondering if the lower back pain is from the herceptin. I also had 2 nurses tell me that chemo can cause back pain so idk.

Honestly I am really shocked that I can somewhat live a normal life while on this FEC,hopefully it stays that way with my next 2 treatments. I would gave to say the absolute worst part of it all is the mental part. Hope everyone is doing well!

I'm the one who started this post, I'm doing ok,finished my taxol and just had my 2nd treatment of FEC, I'm gonna say the taxol was easier for me. The FEC has not been that bad either . could be much much worse. no nausea but I take the meds if I think I may need them or not. I think my biggest complaint has to be the lower lower like into my tailbone back pain and shoulder blade pain but I'm wondering if the lower back pain is from the herceptin. I also had 2 nurses tell me that chemo can cause back pain so idk. Someone asked about hair loss. the taxol made my hair start shedding bad about the 5th week,it just progressed at that point until I was extremely thin on top then right before my FEC treatments started I just went ahead and let my kids shave it all off. they enjoyed that lol. Honestly I am really shocked that I can somewhat live a normal life while on this FEC,hopefully it stays that way with my next 2 treatments.

I too am getting a small amt of hair back. weird thing though is that 4 weeks after chemo I am missing eyelashes on the bottom of one eye and about half on the other!

"ad303d0b-9974-4422-828a-fa7872023a84","Hi everyone, Thought I would join the group since I'm an August too! I have bc recurrence with bone and liver mets and started August 3 on Taxol/Carboplatin but couldn't tolerate the Taxol. I did get Zometa and had flu symptoms two days after for a couple of days, then pain in most of my bones - which they say could have been the Taxol I did get or the Zometa. My Vicodin prescription helped with that. The next week I had Abraxane/Carboplatin and had bone pain and fatigue. The nausea was manageable with Ativan and an occasional Tums. A Neulasta shot the following day caused pain in my sternum and larger bones as the nurses told me. They really know their stuff! Unfortunately, the nausea didn't really subside much - just lessened over the next couple of weeks. I did get the mouth thing - a little annoying but not as bad as I expected. Hair fell out two weeks after chemo and I buzzed it close - but probably will shave it because of all of the little hairs everywhere! I also now I have two wigs - one short one and one ""grow out"" one - since I will be hairless for a while and through the winter. My second treatment was last Friday had both Zometa and Abraxane/Carboplatin. Like I've read here - the second Zometa did not cause the flu symptoms or pain as much as the first time. The overall fatigue and pain were less than the first round but the nausea was a little worse. I have found the same - eating often - healthy food - drinking water and juice - are helpful. The nurses told me that one thing they have heard is that women with lots of nausea during pregnancy have worse nausea with chemotherapy. Yikes - I was sick every day all day for 5 of the 9 months of my pregnancy. Must just be that my digestive system is sensitive to changes! I also find that being distracted helps so I try to stay busy when I'm able. The weather here (Northern California) is finally getting cooler so I will be out walking a little more as I hear that helps nausea too.

I have bc recurrence with bone and liver mets and started August 3 on Taxol/Carboplatin but couldn't tolerate the Taxol.

My Vicodin prescription helped with that. The next week I had Abraxane/Carboplatin and had bone pain and fatigue. The nausea was manageable with Ativan and an occasional Tums. A Neulasta shot the following day caused pain in my sternum and larger bones as the nurses told me. They really know their stuff!

"aed1df06-a0f8-4de4-9747-5d048bde4910","Suzilla, There are a lot of answers on the surgery & radiation site of this board. The only thing I did not do was radiation. I had a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction. I was under for about 8 hours and in for 2 days. The mastectomy took about 3 hours. My surgeon said there would not be much pain with this surgery, but the reconstruction surgery would be painful. Your oncology office may be able to refer you to a place to get camis with pockets or you may find options on the surgical thread. My plastic surgeon told me not to put my hands above my head for 2 weeks. The worst part was being in the hospital due to all the noise level and interruptions. My oncologist recommended that I write a will as I'm stage IV; but every adult should have one just in case even with no disease. I took B6 & B12 for neuropathy while on taxotere. I only had a little tingling in my fingers and I went through 8 treatments. Hope I answered some of your questions. Wishing you the best on your surgery. I tried not to think about it, just got a little nervous the morning of surgery.

"af16f76f-9bac-4ca4-8236-99e9846172c4","I had my hair cut short right before I started chemo. I had 4 DD AC, followed by 4 DD Taxol. On day 13 after my first cycle my hair started coming out. By the time I had my second cycle it was coming out by the handful. There was hair everywhere and a constant reminder of what I was going through. I called my oldest daughter and asked her to buzz my hair off. Even with it buzzed, it kept falling out everywhere so I had myfiance shave it off. It was actually a relief for me to have it all gone. I didn't want to drag out how long it was going to fall out and keeping the stragglers wasn't for me. I bought a wig before I started chemo and a friend gave me another one. My kids had more fun playing with them, than I ever wore them. I wore it twice, once for my wedding and once to have my new drivers license picture taken. I had the picture retaken as soon as my hair grew back! I was a scarf person and I also wore a hat, on occasion. I attended the Look Good, Feel Better program and was told not to wear yellowwhile undergoingchemo. Guess what color I was wearing that day? I also learned how to draw on my eyebrows. They went too.

"b01294b5-e784-4cc0-a183-ca57c6fe7090","Debbie, I think the possibility of a link between the taxanes and lymphedema is an under-explored area. As I've said in other posts, I developed cording in my armpit and upper arm on the at-risk side about 5 weeks after my mast/SNB. I was referred to an LE therapist who taught me exercises, MLD, and wrapping, and fitted me for a sleeve and glove. She said to wear the sleeve and glove when doing risky things (flying etc. ), and keep in touch just in case things worsened. I had no evidence of swelling or discomfort at that time, except for the prominent and painful cord. Bioimpedende measurements on that arm were normal. The cording was gone within a couple of weeks, and everything seemed fine. Five months later, or about 3-1/2 to 4 weeks after finishing 4 rounds of Taxotere & Cytoxan, the cording returned -- along with obvious (to me) swelling in my thumb, forefinger, hand, and forearm on the at-risk side. I also felt that dull ache and heaviness everyone describes. I again sought a referral to the LE therapist, who confirmed what I was experiencing as early-stage LE. The swelling would go down at night but come back by midafternoon of the next day. We reviewed wrapping, I re-learned MLD with the knowledge that the nodes on my at-risk side weren't as capable as we had thought, and she made sure I had a sleeve and glove that fit properly. I had 4 more sessions with her, and she taught me some upper-body exercises that would improve my conditioning and help with the swelling and discomfort. The swelling disappeared. The bottom line: I am convinced that the flare-up of my early stage LE was due to Taxotere. I've searched the medical literature and found a few articles describing the onset of LE-type swelling in association with taxane infusions. The most incriminating evidence was a description of the ""pathophysiology"" (mechanism) of the swelling (edema) that's commonly seen with the taxane chemo drugs. It's not just common ""edema"" (fluid) accumulating in the tissues. it's fluid with a high protein content that leaks out of the bloodstream where the taxanes have caused microscopic damage to blood vessel walls and/or made them leaky (more permeable). The fluid can accumulate and, because of its high protein content, it sometimes doesn't make its way back into the bloodstream as quickly as it should. Add that to the predisposition we already have, due to the damage to our lymphatic vessels and loss of lymph nodes, and . voila! Lymphedema. At least, that's the basis of my current hypothesis. I suggested to my med onco that someone really ought to study the possibility of a relationship between taxane-induced swelling and the subsequent development of LE. She didn't seem surprised, but didn't volunteer to head the study either.otter","lymphedema","and","145","IN","54","is","cord","61","taxan","152","15","DT","link","0","develop","PRP$","1","PRP","post","between","VBD","i","drug-SE","the","NNS","FALSE","armpit","NN","NN","VBG","in","cording","CC","VBZ","my","taxanes","false","2","NN","NNS","0","false","5","invalid","IN","1","123","104","25","1","137","25","68","8","108","44","142"

"b22b4e54-4cc6-48a0-ae41-4a1a53aec440","In July of 2005, I was dx'd with stage IIB IDC with two lymph nodes positive at age 39. I started chemo right away, 12 x weekly Taxol followed by 4 x EC (almost the same as AC) every four weeks. My tumor was originally measured 3.5cm at dx but it shrank to 0.8cm by the time I completed neoadjuvant chemo. Those positive nodes were gone too. I had a lumpectomy along with axilally node dissection (9 nodes removed and none was found positive). Although everything seemed good (clear margins, no nodes, low grade 1, ER/PR +, Her2- etc), I was recommended to do more chemo along with rads. My oncologist said that I was relatively young so he wanted to be as agressive as we could be. Another reason he wanted me to do more chemo was that I had tolerated Taxol pretty well, with almost no side effects other than hair loss. So I went on another 12 x weekly Taxol followed by 30 sessions of rads. Now I am two years out and doing pretty well. No one could ever tell that I had cancer. I hope everything goes well for you no matter what option you choose.

My oncologist told me I could lose weight but breast cancer survivors who had been on Tamoxifen said it was impossible. I went to a MD who specializes in weight loss and nutrition. I followed his meal plan which was very similar to South Beach. It mainly consisted of two fruits per day(only apples and oranges), 2 slices of Ezekial bread per day, lean meats, 2 oz of hard cheese, no processed foods, etc. Had to go weigh in every week and also received B12 injections weekly. I lost 33 pounds, stopped going to his office due to the expense,and kept it off until earlier ths year. I really got bored and missed my carbs and the weight poured back on. Now I weigh more than I ever have and am very unhappy with myself, however I just can't seem to get started back on the plan I was on before. I have started exercising so I am hoping that will help. ButI seem to stay hungry and no matter what I eat I am never satisfied. Any suggestions???

Maybe that's what my problem stemmed from. But honestly I do not think this is an allergic reaction to zofran, but I will ask about it. I am not taking the pills they gave me because I have no nausea, but I do still feel sort of groggy. Went to the office party and only fell asleep once during the play, and had a very good meal. I have been in bed catching up on tv shows I missed, but hope to may accomplish something today. I am working tomorrow since they moved my treatment to Tues so I will have to take that day off. The reason my onco said he preferred adriamycin to the taxotere/carboplatin which was a suggestion of the other onco I consulted with here. both lower dose weekly. was the peripheral neuropathy issue. and I honestly think the neuropathy I had from Xeloda, Gezzar, navelbine or whatever ones caused it in the past is getting better. I only say this because I now have a lot more feeling in my toes. they hurt from the shoes I had on last night so I know they have feeling now. For dry mouth I am using a bunch of Biotine samples I got from work. I have gotten to the point where if I chew gum, I constantly bite my lower lip so I don't chew it. Later: Onco's office just called to see how I am doing. I found out I did not get zofran in with the premeds. only have the tabs to take at home and as I said I am not taking them because I do not need them. The nurse who called said I got emmend(sp) aloxi, pepcid, and decadron in the premeds. the last one mentioned is obviously not working because I know when they used to give me that one, I would be up for two and 1/2 days, cleaning out closets, doing all sort of stuff in the wee hours of the morning.","the","to","921","NN","786","taxoter","peripher","796","adriamycin","942","22","VBN","said","0","the","NULL","3","VBD","week","he","DT","was","drug-SE","prefer","JJ","FALSE","NULL","VBD","NULL","JJ","issu","peripheral neuropathy","TO","NN","NULL","adriamycin","false","3","DT","NN","0","false","6","invalid","PRP","47","44","11","131","80","80","8","1","6","102","-1","1"

It sounds like I had a more involved procedure than some of you (started out in day surgery, had Versed sedation plus local anesthesia and oxygen and an iv, and stayed for three hours post -surgery). I was so sleepy that I slept most of the day and night yesterday and napped today too. I'm a little sore today, but happy to have that thing out and be DONE! Just one more PT session tomorrow! Wow! 10 months of BC treatment and procedures!!! My party is June 7 -- one year after my diagnosis! Its going to be a dance party, with the theme, ""We Rocked Cancer Together""!!! Come to Duluth; the snow MIGHT be gone by then!!! I saw my MO on Thursday! He said he doesn't do blood tests for breast cancer and only does scans if we are worried about something we find. I have to have a mammo in June and need to get in for a pelvic exam as I'm now on tamoxifen. but other than that, he'll see me in three months!! KBee, Viji, and others with hot flashes, I take 75 mg of Effexor and that reduced my hot flashes tremendously! It helps my mood too! Kbee and Josgirl- I cross-country skied 4 times last week, which was fabulous. I'm going to Arizona next week, so I hope to get some running! It is hard to get motivated, especially when dealing with tiredness and life.70sCharger! You're really going to Mexico!!! The last few weeks sound like they have been very stressful! I hope you and your hubby have a chance to relax and have fun!!! BetterDay! Welcome back!!! Your cruise sounds like a blast!!! What a great way to celebrate! Good luck with more tests and getting rid of pesky pain! Simplelife! Your hair is cute!!! I'll be interested to see what you do with the ""Bermuda Triangle"" of white. but you could leave it, too! You earned all those white hairs! Knightzoo! Happy Birthday! Mine was Saturday! 49 and happy to be alive and getting healthy again! Kj! Good news about your son! Sorry you had to go back to the Dr. and wait for test results though! Too much of that in the past year!!

The day after my last chemo and I'm still feeling great, other than a slight sore throat (which I always get.) I had a total of 6 TCH treatments, and will have herceptin only,every three weeks, for the rest of the year. My lashes and brows thinned but with mascara and some brow pencil I look pretty normal! Very little problems with my nails, I just kept them trimmed shorter as they were a little weak. There is no way I could have made it without wigs- my head hair loss was too much and even when it was stubly I would notice the stubble coming out in the tub after each cycle. I'm leary about the idea of fasting to avoid side-effects also. I know it helps me tremendously to each small meals almost constantly. Please be careful and scrap this plan the minute you start to feel weak or nauseaous! My next phase is supposed to be radiation, but my onc sent me for BRCA testing today and if the results are positive she recommends a bilateral mastectomy instead. This really threw me for a loop and I'm praying I'm BRCA negative! Sometimes it feels like you're on one big emotional roller-coaster that never stops for a day of peace! I should have results in 7 to 10 days. I guess that will help determine whether to have a hysterectomy/oopherectomy as well. In the meantime I'm just trying to get through the last cycle of TCH se's as comfortably as possible! Thanks so much for all the fantastic advice and friendship!! This is one fantastic group of ladies! I'm sticking around this board- I'll let you know the BRCA results and what my onc recommends for the next steps.

My biggest fear was permanent hairloss and that I'd spend life with thin hair. That is the reason I cold capped. I had dose dense AC-T and though I probably lost about 70% of my hair, I never had to wear a scarf and by the time I was done round 8, new hair was already growing in. I had 30 rads sessions with almost no skin trouble, after my chemo. And now I've been on Tamoxofen for a month with no side real affects. My biggest trouble was post-treatment depression. I have really struggled with it, but I'm doing much better. My Onc recommended I sign up for counseling that is offered by the Cancer Agency. She suggested it before I was done treatment and said it's common to experience a dip. I signed up and just before my first session, I crashed pretty badly. It's been about 3 months now and I'm doing much better. Life is going well and I'm about to start a new job. I feel like I'm starting afresh.

"cace86fd-2eec-497d-8fae-305aebce4329","WR, Good to hear from you--was worried you were having bad s/e from Taxol. I am really sorry to hear about all your problems. You really need a break-as if bc was not bad enough. Seriously all us should be excused from life's other problems. Go find other doors to knock--we have enough on our plate. I hope your unemployment office gets some sense and you are able to get your last tx. I do not understand why Taxotere cannot be given dd. My coworker had the same problem where she had to switch to Taxotere and she did get dd--atleast I think so. I hope your SO supports you through all this and in Ohio and things work out between you two. Did you ever hear back from your job interview? All, I am going to my first bs consult tomorrow and I hope/pray she does not give any more bad news. I do not want to hear that tumor is growing/chemo not working/possible mets. I get really scared every time I see a doctor. like I am waiting for the other shoe to drop. On Tuesday I go for Taxol #3. I am wondering whether I should ask my onc to switch me to something else. I do not have neuropathy but my bone pain now pretty begins on day 3 and lasts right up to day 14. This is not normal and my treatment #2 of Taxol was worse than tx#1. I am debating whether just to bear it for two more treatments or switch to Taxotere. If I knew that the Taxol was working it would make my decision easier. My weekend was ok--restful at home watching TV. My dh and kids were out at the movies, beach and out to dinner but I had to stay at home because of my pain and general fatigue. I need to vent. Why is cancer the only way to kill people in movies and books? Every movie I see has someone dx with cancer and die. Maybe it has always been like this and I am just more sensitive to it now. Someone gave me the book: Wedding in Dec. Well the lady is getting married because she bc and might die. Another book I read ""Unaccustomed Earth"" had a lady who diedbecause of BC and how it affectedher son. I saw ""Rebecca"" an old Hitchcock movie. *Movie spoiler alert*Well guess why she wants to die--a tumor that could not be treated. I screen book jackets now before I get any book.

"cd84de53-d95f-449e-96ca-4d6e48e99841","Hello again, everyone! My children are all hyped up on jelly beans and chocolate, so hiding from them (and hanging out with you all) seems like the best way to spend Easter afternoon! So glad to hear how many of us are finished chemo! Lucky ladies! I'm 8 down and 8 to go. I'm 1/4 of the way through the taxol/carboplatin combination (after having my last AC 6 weeks ago). I'm on a 3 week cycle, with TC the first week, then just Taxol for the second and third. Repeat x4. Am finding the TC combination much much harder than AC ever was. While I felt very ""not me"" with AC and felt quite yucky and tired, the TC feels like I'm being beaten up by a gang. Actually about 12 gangs, each one with it's own specialty. One gives me mouth sores, one makes me nauseated, one gives me a full body itching including raised welts whenever I scratch. One has been stealing my eyelashes and eyebrows, and several have been ganging up to make me very tired. Another has been giving me chest pains and shortness of breath, one has been refusing to let me sleep, and one has been making absolutely everything taste like platinum, which is a beautiful metal when handed to me in the form of jewellerly, but is not so endearing when sprayed all over my taste buds. Then again there is the crew who are after my fingernails (but they don't want my beautifully painted toenails--go figure?) The last gang is stealing my red blood cells, but I'm going to thwart them with a transfusion this week. I'm really lucky not to have bone pain (yet) and am hiding from that gang if they try to show up! It did help this week to find out that most of the fatigue is likely caused by dropping my hemoglobin by 1/3 in 3 weeks. I'm lucky that a friend had asked to take the kids for a day at the end of this week, so I've got 6 hours available for the transfusion. (6 hours?!? Is it so we can savour every drop as it goes in and admire the hue?) I had had other plans for the day (shopping, resting, a massage?) but you know, hooking up with an IV can be fun too. I'll be on the rheumatology ward, which will be a new experience, at the very least. To be honest, it will be the last day of the 2 week school holidays, and (did I mention that the children are hyped up on food dye and chocolate?) I may well be ready to have a day without them by that point anyhow. The chest pain is a fun symptom and I highly recommend it if anyone is feeling neglected or short of attention. Apparently I didn't use the right code word when I saw the junior doctor last week, and he didn't react right away. I followed up later in the appointment and he said that they don't worry unless one is short of breath. I replied by telling him how my kids had described our latest hike up the hill to my husband, ("". and she could only go like SIX STEPS without having to stop and rest, and when we found a bench she could hardly get to it and then just SAT THERE for TEN MINUTES, and then when we moved she could STILL only go six steps before needing to catch her breath AGAIN!"") (I felt like I was listening to them describe my grandmother.) Anyhow, the nice doctor got all excited at that point, and I got the attention I crave. I'll have an exercise ECG one of these days, but I had a resting one that day, right away. They did say that the hemoglobin drop can put pressure on the heart too, so the body's response can be out of proportion, and getting some blood into me should help. The junior doctor (which I keep mentioning because it drives me mad to see him--everything he discusses with me then needs to be discussed with the real oncologist if I say anything interesting at all--but I don't get to be part of that conversation--he just leaves the room and returns, saying, ""I've spoken to . and they say. "" And I worry that what would be interesting to a real oncologist might not catch his attention through his juniorness), anyhow, he also told me that my hair probaby wouldn't come out any more than it had--by weeks 6 or so of Taxol people's hair comes back. (I had had 3 by that point.) I don't think he knows carboplatin, since I've been shedding like a puppy all weekend. My hair was firmly committed to my head on Thursday, but is quite flabby and weak in resolution now. Down to about 1/4 eyebrows, and hoping to go no further, but will take it as it goes! I'm glad that Easter is over. It's a very big week in our family and I'd been dreading having the carbo plus taxol on Holy Thursday, (not least because I also had to do birthday shopping this weekend) and being knocked flat for such an important week. We're pretty much through it now, aside from the overtired crying and bickering (and the kids are a bit off colour too! ), and I'm going to generously let my husband enjoy that aspect of the holiday while I go off and have a rest! Good luck to everyone on the Mx decisions. It's a really hard decision to make. I have to say that I was really happy with my reconstruction--I didn't realize how happy until I ended up with the messy scar high up on my chest and the deflated breast. It's such a personal decision though; I sympathize with everyone trying to make it. (I'm trying to decide if I should go for a third reconstruction--greedy, that's me! )I hope you all have a long weekend and are able to enjoy time with your families.

"df358a7f-b2e6-426c-bdee-53966c7cf290","My 1st port was a nightmare! Placed in Nov '11, it was removed Feb '12 after my left arm swelled to 2x its size. The IRsaidit had occluded my subclavian artery. Further, the surgeon attached it to my sternum (big ouch!) and the port tipped on its side, making it nearly impossible for the nurse to use. Eachinfusion was a search involving 4-6 sticks with that big needle. The swelling was noticeable within a month after insertion, but the ONC didn't know what to think, so he gave me Lasix thatfurther dehydrated me during chemo! Following removal of the port, I had 2 angioplasty procedures to open the affected veins and arteries, including the insertion of a stent into the subclavian. My final Taxotere infusion went into my right hand (by this time, I couldn't have any needles or even BP on the left side) and literally burned throughmy veins to my skin. I developed lymphedema in my right arm after the mastectomy, so in May '12, I had a 2nd port placed (this time on the right) so I could finish my herceptin infusions (they still can't use my left arm). I still have pain where the 1st port was, where my breast/lymph nodes were (of course) and where thenewport is. The new port is attached to the 2nd rib (normal placement), but a good night's sleep is still a thing of the past, and my various arm movements at work trigger all sorts of odd pain, as well. I guess I'll just keep takingthe Vicodin. who can walk around with warm / ice packs on their chest all the time?

Not deep pink like my friends regular nails but they look like I painted then a light whitish pink. They are still growing and I just trimmed them yesterday. Still stuck down to the nail bed, not flaking or lifting but just very pale looking, I know my hemoglobin is in the upper 10's so it is not pale from anemia. I keep them covered with a clear nutrient polish. Funny the toe nails look normal. Another taxol down today (#10). I drove myself to and from the CTC. With the lower dose of Benedryl I am not drowsy. Luckily I only live 5 blocks away. I figured if I was to dopy to drive I would walk home and walk back later in the evening to pick up my car. But I was fine. I actually enjoyed being there by myself. I visited with a friend who was there for her last chemo for lymphoma. She brought the nurses cookies today. Read the newspaper and a book on IPad. Also got 4 phone calls from friends who all wanted to know if I needed a ride home. It was nice to have some quiet time.

I feel like I can go to work right now. Beeeeezar! I'm a good sleeper. I love that your onco called you, can you tell that you charm people? You seriously do! Shikari, welcome and so sorry on the family stuff. I just don't understand why some family members become so confrontational. A lot of the sibs and parents of the ladies on this board sound a bit narcissistic. My younger sister in Ohio is sending out a care package to me, so I feel so much better. My sisters kind of backed away a bit over this recent diagnosis, but not so much that I had to worry. Just no word from them. I think they just had to get used to the shock because it is scary for blood relatives. What if it happens to them. But some people's family members are just too focused on themselves and are pretty worthless. I'm glad I'm not dealing with that. Hang in there with the AC. I hear if you can survive that, the T is nothing and neither is the H. They first proposed the AC to me, and I asked if I could avoid it. My onco said ""sure"". You might get some sort of odd ball side effects from the taxotere, mostly the blackening of nails, but no biggie. You will be fine. It is a bit more mellow I guess. I don't know but a lot of these wise women here do, so post some Q's. I start tomorrow. hence me being up with wild roid rage. Tee hee! I never stay up this late. WTF? I love this board.
