# Relation_Extraction
Relation Classification via Convolutional Deep Neural Network

The code is an implementation of the paper http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C14-1220 using tensorflow.

The model consists of a convolution layer followed by a max-pool and softmax layer.

My data set consists of inter sentencial entities with entities linked with a cause-effect relationship. However, this model can extended to a n class problem.
