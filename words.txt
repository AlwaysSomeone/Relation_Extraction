hi women just popping in from the may 08 group to give some support and maybe some new advice i just finished 4 rounds of carboplatin cytoxan and am now on weekly taxotere for 12 weeks 1 if you are prone to constipation be ware and get ahead of it i found a plum juice made from the same plums they use in prune juice and it worked fine as long as i took it days ahead 2 biotene is a must or something like it never had severe mouth sore but any time my mouth feels a little funky i rinse with it 3 someone mentioned a while back that she was getting regular toothbrushes and going to dispose of them every couple of weeks great idea and do the same with disposable razors had 2 staph infections just regular staph and one was because of my razor i noticed there is a kelly hey that is one of my names and like you kelly i have been the keeper of the schedule for the may group i mind at all and it has helped us to know who is going when on a given week support each other been the most helpful part and feel free to visit us or pm me if you need want any more info yes xeloda has been easy than taxotere cytoxan however it is till cytotoxic chemo i am on a week on week off schedule 2 times 3x 500 mg pills side effects are cumulative and fatigue builds up slowly by day 5 i feel very exhausted today i am staying at home with exception of my lymphedema treatment cycle 6 fatigue taking day off feeling noxious dizzy took medication have been feeling better today constipation colace heartburn zantac eye irritation eye drops twice a day myalgia muscles spasms medication for muscles edema swelling of arms and feet regular lymhedema treatments wishing everyone a nice day greenae i gained 18 lbs from taxotere it took 12 to 16 weeks to come off it was all fluid in my lower body if you weight gain is from that no worries it will come off you will live in the bathroom shedding the fluid thank you brittaa i will visit your blog as soon as possible to all on taxotere please ask for the ice gloves my nails are all bad and black from taxotere and i had the ice gloves for treatment 3 and 4 i should have the gloves on for 1st and 2nd treatment but no one told me about that se about diarrhea i had some bad ones but emodian help and eating crackers only did the trick for me xoxox to all kiwi unfortunately goofy is too far from my but try to find someone goofy to hug and post a pic pearl lady a week at the beach in mass sounds way better than two weeks in the hot florida sun i envy you have fun and enjoy the sounds of the waves i know about nj but i think medical pot is legal in some states you could probably ask your onc just asked my onc for ritalin as i understand it helps with chemo fatigue having problems with my insurance company in getting it so may have to pay for it myself today i am down and out after chemo on wednesday carboplatin has my number i usually have days of extreme fatigue anyway if you hear from me for a couple of weeks because my mom lives in the middle of no where and internet is sketchy at best hoping for good weeks for everyone i did my ooph last october simple laparoscopic home that day mild discomfort for 2days then back to normal yoga work etc started on arimidex right away brca 2 maternal aunt had ovarian cancer mom and 2 aunts with breast noticed my joints are creakier and some hot flushing only at night sorry for the blunt information but vaginal dryness is the worst side effect vitamin e suppositories are my friend and my for sure lol i already have two children ages 13 and 10 so the childbearing issue exist happy i did it despite the side effects given the difficulty with ovarian cancer detection in fact my onc was more insistent on scheduling the ooph before my preventive mx and pretty easygoing check out yahoo news from the last week they featured an article stating that ovarian cancer screening is usually insufficient to catch cancer in its earliest stages i say go for it we have enough to worry about i had my first dose thursday sept 10 no port nurse blew the first arm vein and i started crying remembering my iv rocephalin treatments for systemic lyme disease during the middle of my second pregnancy and the docs blowing 2 or 3 hand veins for every dose of course on my left hand which is the chemo side now right mastectomy but she got in on the second try i did not ake a cold cap doc suggested skipping because of my migraine hsitory was supposed to get a cooling glove in hopes of reducing the chance of neuropathy after the trouble getting into my vein plus having to order the second drug to give first i guess it got forgotton will ask for one next time then they wanted to hang the taxotere first opposite to oncologist and all read so i insisted and got theherceptin first after an hour wait while it was prepared surprisingly no symptoms from that and a friend who works at the hopsital dropped by for a chat during the intervening saline washout told them i always want the herceptin first wishing i was given a port but the practice here is ports only after periferal veins are gone the taxoter burned my vein almost from the start but upping the carrier saline flow rate helped until they let the bag run dry twice during with two elderly patients in the same room have to learn to watch the bags myself and call for help before dry after the last washout saline no objective symptoms on my forearm nurse said to call if anything happens side effects two isolated sneezes during taxotere mild nausea starting as i left the infusion center over quickly with one primperan pill exhaustion and unsteady on my feet not dizzy just weak started near the end of the tazoter infusion and worsened at home same for an initially mild headache that worsened especially at bedtime went to bed a bit early but awake now at am luckily headache is gone my dexamethasone schedule was a bit different from what people here are writing five mg tablets mg the evening before chemo chemo morning them chemo day evening i was given a neulasta kit single injection i give to muself at home between 24 and 48 hrs after then end of the infusions so friday late afternoon evening being a worrier and bearing how you ladies seem to be getting multiple injections of this white cell booster i hope mine works for me also i asked about clarytin but nobody at infusion clinic ever heard of that finland got scared and a bit confused when they said the bone pain mght not start for several days how does one plan anything have been tanking water and hoping to flush this tiff out of my body asap hi everyone three more regular rads and then 7 boosts and then done about two weeks more ughh been trying to keep up with walking because of the neuropathy along with two root canals and dad in hospital i am worn out kind of down when expecting to be charged up about getting to the finish line after reading about the taxotere possibly not being effective for estrogen responsive cancer i was really saddened to see that these leg problems could have been avoided the rads been a huge problem until a few days ago extremely raw feeling total sore breast and would you know the doctor took a dang huge felt pen to circle and mark the boost area for mapping and then they tried to scrub off the dye with alcohol damn that hurt and sorry but what the heck do we bother worrying about carcenogenic foods exposures etc when they go and scrub felt pen dye into you and now they say this will be done for 7 days during boosts it stung like heck too on this sore boob again this stuff is a real mix of voodoo take care everyone and happiness to you all when the rads are over mdoc so sorry for your loss i am finally bouncing back from the horrible fatigue i was able to go out to dinner and still feel ok hurrah for feeling ok one more week before the next taxol i hope i bounce back so much that it hit me as hard lost more hair i hope i can have a nice shiny bald head because my triple negative tumor was 8 mm not considered enough to participate in a tetrathiomolybdate tm trial i developed neutropenia during chemotherapy that was bad enough for my doctor to stop my treatment after two ac infusions i was supposed to have four i feel uneasy about stopping chemo in the middle and would like to take tm does anyone know the cost of buying tetrathiomolybdate at a compounding pharmacy in nyc and have an appointment with dr vadat in a few weeks thanks patinmn that would be great if you could ask your doctor i am trying to research myself now but have a little bit of chemo brain i am definitely getting other opinions it seems most publications say tamoxifen is beneficial but i found any research discussing the level of estrogen receptive where it is beneficial just generally er number 11 down tired tired tired i feel like my worse weeks were 7 and 8 not so bad this week which is odd considering cumulative counting down the seconds until the last infusion i know not a magic wand and it will be a few weeks before i feel like i am getting back to normal but still cannot wait for it to end then on to radiation wow i finally understand the insurance charges thanks rebecca you explained it so well the book insurance woes for dummies as i need a copy for every room in the house t4t i get blisters on my hands very easily i was cutting coupons the other day and within minutes i had a big blister on the inside of my thumb i was amazed at how thin my skin is i have taxol 3 tomorrow at today for the first time i noticed my feet burned when standing i too have been slacking on germs and not being careful just my hands are so dry i stand to wash them every time i touch something i bought some of that anti bacterial hand lotion from bath and body and now i stand the smell of it maybe its the lack of nose hairs but smells get to me bad i know i am not suppose to clean up after the cats but my dh is always at work and i take it anymore so i put on some gloves a bandanna over my mouth and nose and cleaned the litter pans then i prayed i pay later for it ya know it as soon as i was done a cat went and dirtied it up just like a kid you would think that for all my effort she could of waited at least an hour lol be well chickies talk again soon nancy ive been on letrozole for almost 3 years but its only the last year that ive developed male pattern baldness in that my most severe hair loss is at the temples and the front of my head in fact i used to wear my hair in a fringe but now i dont have enough hair at the front for a fringe maybe it took so long for it to become so noticeable because i had very thick hair to start with i do know that my shower becomes blocked regularly due to my hair loss oh well yet another side effect to contend with along with the constant urine infections loss of sex life painful joints and weight gain but as my cancer had spread to most of my lymph nodes and i had 3 large tumours i sometimes have to take a step back and realise that it is probably this drug that has given me this time so grateful ss xx happy saturday everyone 9 days past tx 3 tc and h when they can add the herceptin back and the first few days after i had a bit of shedding but the past few days very little but the ses for 3 have been the worst yet i would have thought by day be back to normal but yesterday was one of the worst for nausea i had to force myself to get on the treadmill and i think it made it worse hoping today finds things settling back down like to have a few days of feeling good before they zap me again with 4 and again if the herceptin is added back my last since my doctor agrrees with the 4 verus 6 even for tch hey nmoss hope you are doing well and wow 4 almost done you just cringe when people say it seems to have gone so quickly they just know do they when did everyone notice their hair growing back in where they lost it with the caps i have a friend who use the caps and her hair started growing back during chemo she was on tch too arlene hi sandy and karin it sure is great to hear you all are going well considering hard to believe what we all went through a year ago i recently made an appt with my surgeon and was thinking gee that date sounds familiar then i realized it was the anniversary of my surgery i have done well this past year considering i did have to go on tamoxifen and i just hate it my oncologist put me on a low dose of effexor cause of the hot flashes that would happen and it is happening wonder how bad they would have been it i wasnt on that drug but the good news from that is it is helping me sleep that has been great i have had a weight gain on tamoxifen that i am not happy with we talk about the chocolate need to start taking care of that i have occasional twinges of pain at the lumpectomy site and understand that is quite normal the tanning at the radiation site is slowly resolving i do not go to this site much but remember how important this site was to me last year i read about the ladies that are starting their journey now and it really takes me back in time nice to know we have 1 year out under our belt i still find it hard to believe i had cancer but i also know i consider myself lucky that it was dcis take care everyone you have been my lifeline donna congrats batcat glad your daughter is on the mend hoping this round treats you well i had my 8th taxol yesterday have had a headache and sore neck since i got home worst felt right after infusion super glad i get my flu shot thursday ugh we have my 90th bday party tonight and a showing for our house this afternoon i love all the halloween pics and kbee your wig pic is awesome i finally gave up on the wig that acs let me order from a catalogue i love this one i bought so much better like my real hair was before i cut it but darker and then a friend of mine asked her sister to loan me her wigs and i left with eight haha fun to play with there are probably 2 or 3 i will wear out the long does tend to get snarly this picture was last weekend at the pink hockey event the jersey says cancer sucks down the arms and we bought his so be fun to wear to future games 5 1 and my oldest son is 6 3 plus skates and yes a mullet ok ladies i have a weird question so far i have taken 2 weekly doses of herceptin and 1 dose of taxol i had an allergic response the first week so they did more premedication the second week and i was able to tolerate it my chemo days right now are fridays so i am due tomorrow well last friday i noticed that my left breast was red warm and swollen this is where my surgeon had done the biopsy and left a metal tumor marker in he started me on bactrim for the infection i was having no symptoms at all from the breast other than what i just described i feel bad at all after i came down off of my steriod high sunday am i began some serious aches and pains and fever it was always a low grade fever it never has been over but of course i always medicated it with tylenol or 100 well on monday i phoned the cancer center to report by then my breast looked almost completely normal no swelling and just slight reddness but i was still having fever and muscle and bone aches they asked me to come in for a chest labs and blood and urine cultures everything was perfect they told me the pains were related to the taxol but not the fever they told me to call back if it got to 101 they talked of putting me on a second antibiotic to kill other types of bacteria but decided against it ok fast forward to yesterday i was still having a low grade temp with aches so i called to ask if i could just go ahead and have that second antibiotic because i want to take the chance on running fever friday am and missing my chemo they said no they want to risk damaging my kidneys but they still budge on holding my chemo if i have fever so i have been trying to find info on the net that might explain my fever i think it is related to my chemo like an inflammatory response i know that would be unusual but i truely think that is what it is do any of you ladies know anything about this i have found a little bit but not a whole lot i am thinking about loading myself down with tylenol tomorrow so i have fever when they take it advise comments criticism thank you ladies so much amy ame good luck everyone who is going tomorrow great cindy that you have side effects yet from taxol good that keeping us posted as many of us sure have taxol in our futures i heard about possible numbness in fingers and toes and am worried about that my ec 3 is on thursday such a shame to get back to a chemo fatigue because feeling so normal and energetic but fortunately the fatigue fades after a week bosumblues it is true if you can even force yourself to walk or exercise even a little and then a lttle more it really does get better for me anyway i would take pictures on my walks and stop and pet peoples dogs and bring a big bag and scissors to cut flowers with paying attention to all those things it really would distract me and sometimes i would find cool other things as sometimes people around here will leave stuff at the curb in boxes for free but i am taking wellbutrin for helping to stop smoking i dont feel it helps with that but it does seem to help with depression that i am sure is caused by femara one was okay but my pcp said to try two one in am and one around 4 he said it would also help with fatigue and it does i am soooo happy for that i was a person who ran literally ran around pretty happy so i am glad a little of my former self is very sloooowly coming i love that you said whilst and it is true the a i s can make your cholesterol significantly higher especiall after a round of tamoxifen i just found out and boy am i pi ed off for a walk even tho it is already hot hi jewelsbeen so busy with work the last few days that the last thing i want to do is open up my mac so sorry for the long post you gems are never going to believe thisi feel like a broken record or scratched cd in these modern times were heading into another winter storm i think dh and i jinxed it by hauling down the motorcycles nuts the weather guessers are saying 10 inches by saturday morning its crazy kimberly honey so sorry to hear about this setback i hope youre not in a lot of pain ive been thinking of you ever since carol informed ussending healing thoughts and wishes your way patty love the picture of you and dh with the vette what a great ride im sorry to hear about the news vettesis got thinking of her and hoping that she will get answers and can begin to formulate a plan at our house were wild hockey fans go for the cup kris yay for being done with ac good riddance eh deb sorry to hear about how uncomfortable youve been remember its all about support not keeping up hoping youll be feeling better soon carol it was so good of you to inform us of kimberlys situation thank you too for mentioning my support of my friend as it happened she and i talked again on tuesday she seems to be in a better place mentally than earlier im going to keep checking up on her though or do you think thats intrusive julie dang what are we gonna do with those nasty migraines of yours i hope they pass quicklyweather does do that to me but youve had more than your fair share sis jenn lj and maz wendy was thinking of you all yesterday and today as you bellied up to the bar hope things were uneventful jenn what great pictures that little guy is a doll dcmom welcome i too am on taxol no herceptin dd every two weeks for four cycles i finished 3 last thursday last one a week from today yay honestly i have to admit its not as bad as i thought it might be way easier than ac biggest issues have been the neuropathy in the fingers lots of pins and needles onc pulled back the dosage last week to help with that luckily it hasnt spread to the toes as ive been told it could the bone pain is another issue again onc came to the rescue with a regiment of motrin and tylenol it aint perfect but is tolerable when i stay regular with those the pain is fairly intense day 3 and 4 i also get a neulasta shot on friday doubling up on bone pain issues i have had no issues with swelling but the old taste buds are history almost worse than with the ac on day 1 thru 4 i do use my ativan at night to sleep zofran day 2 and 3 no issues with nausea at all hope this information is helpful and that youll have very few ses the other difference with taxol is the length of the tx its twice as long as ac and can cause allergic reactions youll be given some sort of antihistamine before tx and watched closely by nurses on that note i also take claritin or zyrtec every day to help with ses sheshe glad to see you back again we missed you paula and dana best wishes to you for tomorrow fubc good night allsending hugs tina this thread terrifes me headaches migraines have been the bane of my existance for 22 years the headache pain you ladies are describing sounds similiar to a milder migraine full blown ones leave you vomiting unable to move in true agony for 18 plus hours a week ago i had a unilatral mastectomy with te and just as i feared the morphine gave me a horrible migraine i had warned my doctors that i would need imitrex in the hospital but the nurses were too ignorant busy to understand the dosage so i get enough to keep the pain at bay i was left with the choice of refusing morphine and suffering the surgical pain to keep the migraine from returning or dealing with migraine and getting surgical pain relief but since migraine makes you vomit then you know there much relief if you have never experienced a migraine you might be surprised that i chose to the surgical pain migraine is the worst pain ever experienced and i had one 48 hour unmedicated hard labor if you knew me realize that when i say i was left crying wailing in pain in bed waiting for imitrex would be almost impossible she had it in her hand at left to do something and come back until leaving me in agony i cry ever but it was that bad i completely lost control imitrex is an expensive medication i only get 9 pills and 4 injections a month which is not enough so i also take fioricet and norco on a regular basis and have for 22 years reading that herceptin can cause a headache terrifies me honestly i think get through herceptin treatment unless there is a plan for dealing with any resulting headaches which for me are likely to end up migraine but to give you ideas you might ask your doctors about imitrex and see if indicated for people who have not been previously with migraine also botox has been used to treat head pain migraine i have been doing botox for years first given to me by my neurologist it stopped working for my migraines but it did at first i still do it because it still helps with migraine related vertigo and cuz i like a smooth forehead now maybe something that would be safe and helpful for herceptin headaches worth an ask if anybody gets treated for these heachaches please let me know what they give you i believe start my chemo in november and then herceptin a few months later so i will be researching until then people have said they notice my lash brow loss either unless i point it out i do wear glasses so that helps my nails are fine so far with only one or 2 getting dark at the base nothing else my biggest issues with taxol so far are joint pain for 4 or so days then they feel weak the rest of the time but not too bad my throat is sore with a cough itching is driving me crazy eager to see if there are any issues with my liver enzymes when people ask me how i am i just say okay or hanging in there not going to be great until this stuff is out of my system for those with ringing in your ears there is someone on another thread that has dealt with itand has a great deal of wisdom it is the starting chemo innov 2011 anyone else thread great ladies over there and sure you would be welcome to chime in and ask my next tx is tuesday will be glad to have it done sleep well all hello been on arimidex now for a couple of months after taking 5 yrs of tamoxifen i was wondering if anyone has experienced a bad taste in there mouth i enjoy thanksgiving today at all because of it it started about 30 days into taking the drug and no food or drink is the same anymore in fact downright disgusting i have some joint pain and insomnia but i can deal with that taste is something not sure i can give u hey all i was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011 i started on tamoxifen in sept 2011 but had to go off of it in november 2011 because of a large ovarian cyst believe it or not my after fertility treatment for my 2 children 2 miscarriages and my vasectomy i found out i was pregnant in january 2012 when i was going for my ultrasound to f u on my ovarian cyst i went back on the tamoxifen after i had my 3rd child in sept 2012 again i had an ovarian cyst and had to go off of it i am going to try 1 more time after my reconstruction surgery which is scheduled for next week if i get a cyst again they may try me on zolodex i think that is it i am very worried i felt old overnight when i was on tamoxifen so tired and muscle pain has anyone else experienced any of these issues on tamoxifen jess thanks ruth i was having horrible joint pain on tamoxifen i know arimidex can also give you joint pain but i am hoping it so bad i do feel a little bit off tonight after having that shot in my belly and taking my pill i read where women are taking the pill in the morning as it disrupts your sleep i am not good about taking pills in the morning as far as having a consistent time so i am hoping having ambien to take at night will help me fall asleep hello fabulous women i have been reading and catching up on posts glad to hear sweethope that your heart is in pretty good shape my tumor was also on my left side very large had a full mastectomy still have to have rads because the margins were so small i spoke with my rad onco and what happens is that the radiation is delivered at an angle from the side so it misses the heart and most of the lung i have to have my axilla radiated as well as the lymph node over my breast zap zappity zap brca 1 and 2 test covered as preventative care under the affordable care act so my insurance will pay 100 whew also i am so happy for you beachbum that your heart is stabilizing if i read your post right i want everything to go the best it can possibly go for you and still want to slap your onco lots going on thanks for all of the tips for taxol i have the ppe effect going on in my feet too feels like my skin is burning up and going to fall off at some point ouch started after last ac infusion i will start icing immediately i am going to ask my onco if i can take an extra week off between ac and taxol i need some time not to feel like a cancer patient and i want my se to get better before i start another toxic round thinking she will say no but gonna ask anyhow the nausea from 4th and final dose of ac is finally wrapping up man 5 to 7 days of that i have lost 5 pounds this time really eating is just a chore now sugar tastes so awful maybe that is a good thing my tongue feels burnt too and i have taste buds falling off when i brush my teeth i feel so sexy hahahaha nails are darkening ready for the nail polish and the tea tree oil love that stuff also my skin is if that is a word so attractive i have to wear white cotton gloves on my hands like a proper lady from the 1950s but when i take the time to apply all the lotions and potions to my face and hands i feel better concealer goes a long way to pretty day here lots of bulbs blooming plus i just found at the butter london horse power nail website that they have a coupon that ends today for 30 off your entire ordercode springbezzie 15have a good weekend d segunda see my profile below i had ac t dose dense every 2 weeks then i had 6 weeks of carboplatin though only completed due to neuropathy from t and carbo i went to an nci hospital ohsu and the lead mo believes in carboplatin for brca patients because they are effective on the type of cancer that results from lacking that tumor suppressor gene i also had a high oncotype score stage 1 and the throw the kitchen sink at it now theory applied in my case though i think this mo gives carboplatin in addition to conventional chemo to all of his brca patients it was 5 months of chemo though i walked and walked throughout and a year later feeling good i had a discussion with another brca woman her at bco going to mda they would not add it to their strict protocol dana farber does last i heard they get the recruitment levels they needed to test it but plenty of anecdotal evidence that platins are highly effective in brca women one small polish study had very good results there is currently a clinical trial for a parp inhibitor for stage iv by biomarin another promising chemo for brca hi everybody new here to posting but have been following you all for some time now i was diagnosed in october with stage 3 breast cancer i felt alone and scared but you all have kept me on track and made me realize i was not alone and that what i was going through was also common with others my ac treatments went somewhat smoothly but after second round got severely constipated have let it get as far as it did because ended up with hemorrhoids this has been the worst of any of my i had bone pain and tiredness from the ac neulasta but again the biggest pain was my butt i ended up having emergency surgery on feb 5th for hemorrhoid surgery and had a 4 inch long internal hemorrhoid that had completely ulcerated inside of me the pain was excruciating still recovering from that its been a very slow process my taxol experience has been very uneventful i am on my 8th out of 12 sessions and so far the only had have been some continued tiredness but no neuropathy as of yet my taste is still all messed up my mouth is like a cotton ball and i have major mucus issues constantly blowing my nose it drives me nuts i am getting down to the end with gods grace all will continue to go well i have a friend who is a photographer and she has documented my journey for me just going to share a picture with me that she did my blessings to you all michelle hi sylvia and everyone i hope you are all doing ok i had my last chemo on wednesday 29th and am relieved it is all over now although the horrible side effects are starting to kick in i had a few rough days after the last cycle with muscle aches and fatigue but generally feel i have fared better than many on tax the taste changes seem to last most of the cycle unlike on fec where they lasted only just over a week or so i have also found the fatigue is pretty continuous too i have now got some dates for my radiotherapy which is due to start on 19 february through until 11 march i hope i will be able to go back to work on 31 march as there will be no more treatment for me after that sorry to hear about your recurrences jenn i hope you are coping and not getting too down it must be a very worrying time for you best wishes to everyone else going through treatment our facebook group for the october optimists is still going strong and i have mostly been posting on there hence i been on for a while kind regards everyone anne i guess the u s went well the tech was very nice but she tell me what if anything she saw i know that they supposed to tell you anything just that the waiting is the hardest part get the results from my surgeon on oct 7th when i go back to see him he believe in calling with the results even if good news and that makes him so busy cmb 35 thanks for thinking of me i know it is so strange because the first time i really worry about it at first but after the gyn dr told me really bad she had me so scared sherri thanks for the prayers they really do help that is what got me through last year debbie glad that you seem to be doing ok and healing well after your surgery i know at first those new boobs just feel right they are now feeling more like me in fact they really feel any different i know that they look bigger than my real breasts but they are starting to look and feel normal to me if that makes any sense i am also getting sick and tired of worrying about every little ache and pain that i get i think that the post treatment period has been harder for me than when i was in active treatment at least then i was focusing on getting through the tx and it seem that i was having any weird pains maybe now that not focusing on just making it through the tx i am thinking too much at least my dh says that i think too much i think going to go job hunting because obvious that dress shoppe for me but i do like to think that being productive and i like to have to ask my dh for money diane geez that sucks that you had a reaction to the taxol i think that the abraxane will work fine for you i have read that other women who have an allergic reaction to the chemo they were given if they switched them to something a little different they did just fine oh and i agree about the xanax i want to use it but since my 1 yr bc anniversary it has been just one thing after another sometimes i think that anti anxiety meds can help us to get through a rough patch and that has to be a good thing i got some when i had that d c for the uterine polyps and glad i have it i just had that u s today and i may go crazy unless i take the xanax because i go back to see my surgeon til oct 7th for my results good luck be thinking of you thanks everyone for all the support hugsharley lol windlass i agree more like others i was told that this would be so much easier than the fec i had in the first round thing is i have any particular trouble with the fec with the taxotere i am getting all kinds of unpleasant things happening including bone pain sore throat messed up stomach inability to eat for a week messed up nails grrrrrr i am thankful that the last one is tomorrow pooh our knowledge the zipp trial is the largest that has investigated an lhrh agonist 2706 women and the only factorial study that has evaluated goserelin and tamoxifen simultaneously with a control group of women who received no endocrine therapy recurrence and breast cancer mortality rates in both the tamoxifen and control arms were similar to those from the ebctcg overview 3 the overview of lhrh agonists 4 based on an average of years reported data on recurrence death from any cause and death after recurrence the main conclusions were that lhrh agonists had an effect on reducing the risk of these events similar to that for chemotherapy such as fec or cmf and could be used as an effective treatment in women with tumors either alone or in combination with chemotherapy or tamoxifen furthermore there seemed to be a particular benefit among younger women 40 years who had received chemotherapy although our earlier data were included in the overview 4 our results from the average is 12 years add further information on the effect of lhrh agonists and allow estimates of the absolute risk difference at 10 and 15 years after the start of treatment in addition to information on recurrence and death from any cause we analyzed the effect of goserelin on the chance of dying from breast cancer and the chance of having any event recurrence new tumor or death our analysis also quantified the effect of goserelin separately among women who did or did not have tamoxifen because tamoxifen is now offered routinely to many women it is important to know what the additional benefit of goserelin is 10 and 15 years after the initiation of treatment among women who did not receive tamoxifen goserelin was associated with large reductions in the event rate the chance of dying from any cause or from breast cancer and the risk of having a recurrence the effect remained substantial 15 years later although the effect of goserelin was smaller and not statistically significant among women who took tamoxifen a difference in risk of percentage points in absolute risk at 15 years might be important given the high incidence of early breast cancer this would correspond to treating women with tamoxifen and goserelin to avoid one woman having a recurrence new tumor or death indeed the number needed to treat at 15 years was 18 in women younger than 40 years who also took tamoxifen table 3 the effect of goserelin was greatest in women who were node negative and in those with tumors our results were also consistent with the observation that the effect of goserelin may be greater in younger women who had prior chemotherapy 4 a limitation of our trial is that it was based on 2 years of tamoxifen treatment like many other studies at the time though it is now standard practice to treat women for 5 years data from the int 0101 trial in which all women received chemotherapy showed that the combination of 5 years of goserelin and tamoxifen was associated with a 9 year rate that was 9 and 7 percentage points higher among younger 40 years and older 40 women respectively compared with those treated with goserelin alone 9 furthermore there is evidence that a large proportion of women discontinue tamoxifen before 5 years in a cohort of 2816 women in ireland 20 had stopped by years with no further hormonal therapy 10 therefore the effect of 2 years of goserelin or tamoxifen therapy might still be relevant in these women data on the tolerability of goserelin were presented in our first report 5 the most common side effect was hot flashes this was experienced by none of the control patients 26 of patients treated with goserelin 17 of those treated with tamoxifen and 44 of those who received goserelin plus tamoxifen in a trial of 874 women with lymph breast cancer randomly assigned to receive six courses of cmf chemotherapy goserelin for 2 years or cmf followed by 18 months of goserelin a greater proportion of women who received goserelin alone had hot flashes compared with those treated with cmf alone 11 however in the goserelin group the incidence 3 years later was similar to that in baseline but not in those who received cmf this effect is expected given that amenorrhea can be induced by either chemotherapy or goserelin but is reversible after stopping goserelin but permanent after chemotherapy goserelin was also associated with an improvement in measures such as mood coping effort tiredness nausea and or vomiting and overall subjective assessment of health compared with cmf alone 11 bone loss is a side effect of ovarian ablation or aromatase inhibitor therapy which increases the risk of fractures or spinal cord compression 12 in a subgroup of patients randomly assigned to receive goserelin n 53 for 2 years or cmf chemotherapy for 6 months n 43 loss of bone mineral density bmd was greater in the goserelin group 13 although there was partial recovery 1 year after stopping goserelin the bone loss in the cmf group persisted although the combination of goserelin and tamoxifen may have a small additional benefit compared with either alone there may be a further case for recommending both therapies because of the possible mitigating effect of tamoxifen on bmd markers of bone health were not measured in all women in the zipp trial but the effects of 2 years of treatment with goserelin and tamoxifen on bmd were examined in a subgroup n 89 of patients in the stockholm group 14 the reduction in bmd was 5 in the patients treated with goserelin with partial recovery 1 year after stopping therapy and in the patients treated with tamoxifen and goserelin there is accumulating evidence that zoledronic acid combined with endocrine therapy can also help prevent bmd loss in a trial of 401 patients treated with goserelin women were randomly assigned to receive 3 years of either tamoxifen or anastrazole each with or without zoledronic acid 15 there were reductions in lumbar spine and trochanter bmd when tamoxifen or anastrazole was used alone but no material reduction when zoledronic acid was added a combined interim analysis of two recent randomized trials and total from both trials n 1667 in which all women received adjuvant letrozole compared giving zoledronic acid either at the time of random assignment or only if their bone density fell below a prespecified cutoff or they suffered a nontraumatic fracture 16 after 1 year the score for lumbar spine bmd was higher in the patients given zoledronic acid at the time of random assignment and the total hip score was higher there was also evidence that the risk of recurrence was lower in these patients the effect of zoledronic acid on survival and recurrence has been confirmed in a large trial of 1801 premenopausal women randomly assigned to receive endocrine therapy tamoxifen or anastrozole with or without zoledronic acid with all women receiving goserelin 17 the risk of death or recurrence was reduced by 35 95 ci 8 to 54 among women who were given zoledronic acid given its benefits in terms of both bone health and clinical outcome zoledronic acid could be considered as an additional treatment to goserelin the optimal frequency and duration of treatment with lhrh agonists are unknown in the zipp trial goserelin was given monthly for 2 years evidence from a randomized trial of 599 women with breast cancer indicated that a less frequent schedule 3 monthly depot of the lhrh agonist leuprorelin acetate mg may be as beneficial as cmf chemotherapy in terms of the effect 5 year survival hr and after 2 years os was better in patients given leuprorelin acetate hr 95 ci to 18 nevertheless no trial has specifically addressed the question of the optimal frequency and duration of goserelin treatment in summary of our large trial showed that goserelin had a demonstrable effect on survival and recurrence 15 years after starting treatment and is as effective as tamoxifen when each are given for 2 years the benefit was greatest among women who did not receive tamoxifen among every 100 women treated with goserelin there could be fewer breast cancer deaths and there was a possible gain in those who did receive tamoxifen among every 100 women treated with goserelin there could be fewer breast cancer deaths it may be that women who are unlikely to complete 5 years of tamoxifen tablets may prefer 2 years of goserelin injections it may also be reasonable to recommend both therapies to minimize the reduction in bmd associated with endocrine treatment hi wave whisperer yes the micromet was 5mm just verified it on the pathology report there was also lymphovascular invasion that showed up at lateral and superior inked margins basically the smallest amount that would get chemo the chemo was doable tacx 6 like mom i worked a flexible schedule with fmla during treatment took off thursday and friday for each chemo infusion on thursday and neulasta shot on friday i rested a lot drank lots of water and made sure i ate a lot of protein i found that eating greek yogurt helped keep thrush in the mouth at bay main side effects were hair loss and fatigue did need the magic mouth wash a couple of times for thrush since the chemos were every 3 weeks the weekend before a chemo i would do something fun like a movie or a play mainly just tried to roll with it not push too hard but not withdraw completely doing well i went from 6mo appointments staggered with each of bs mo and ro at the end of last year after this mammo the schedule went from 6mo to yearly i am on femara for five years hot flashes and some joint achiness but manageable the choice is personal and depends on your situation no one right answer the answer that makes sense for you all the best meg i was on doxil for either 4 or 5 chemo brain cycles and never lost my hair it worked great on my liver mets and work at all on my lung mets which is why i was taken off of it i mind being on it at all i need to be on fentynal patches at all and i like not being in control of how much pain medication i need during the day i take oxycontin for pain and percocet for break through pain i also take neurontin and all of this together seems to work fine i notice and more pain while on doxil too i wish i could have stayed on it but what can you do frannystage iv 10 years now with metastatic breast cancer i had my first herceptin treatment 2 weeks ago on tch every 3wks runny bloody nose severe diarrhea achy weak still even after two weeks i have one week till my next treatment and i hope i have at least one good day before that lost 15 lbs in these two weeks no fun i started tamoxifen feb 22nd sometime after that i noticed severe genital itching i sat out in the sun at a baseball game with sunscreen on on apr 1st by the morning of april 4th i was breaking out in hives i contacted my care manager but she said she had never heard of this i am proof you should never say never i have obviously stopped the tamoxifen we are working to find some relief from the itching burning to stop the spread the doc said this is the most severe hive case ever seen so has anyone else reacted with hives i wonder if the itching initially as a sign of an allergy to tamoxifen the sunlight just blew it up into my current misery hi there i just got done with the ac thank goodness my first taxol is next friday i am curious how your taxol experience goes i have to take the 10 blue pills before my first treatment i can give you one bit of advice that if you have bone which i had major bone pain from ac even with the neulasta shot get some wheat grass from the vitamin store its all organic and it lessened my bone pain by 30 percent at least just from the first little packet this time last week i would have been flat on my back i no longer require as much pain pills and can function normally for the most part it helps to build and faster you can research it on the net if you want i wonder why they gave you taxol first i am always curious at different patients protocols mine is 4 and 4 ac then taxol i guess that is the standard i think anyways please keep me and us posted i am curious but i know neuropathy does happen in some and to tell your dr if you do normal things like tie your shoes other than that i would just hold and hope it passes i asked like a dummy about the ice trick also and they gave me weirdo look i actually feel good and will probably go back to swimming tomorrow now that my bone pain has gone down so much i am not saying it will work for everyone but it worth a try gl and let me us know how you are doing i also was following bottle but found this thread today i had multiple ses from chemotherapy and am currently on gabapentin to treat those and am having ses from the gabapentin now slow mental function difficulty finding words etc i added tamoxifen in january took it for just six weeks at four weeks i was having such severe depression and anger and felt as if i was crawling out of my skin as well my energy level was zapped so badly that i was unable to be out of bed more than about eight hours a day and i was having severe pain in my ribs shoulders and legs and my mental functioning was completely gone about 1000 worse than with the gabapentin alone i discussed this with my oncologist she did ask about any homicidal or suicidal thoughts and i certainly had entertained the idea most of the day on most days over the past couple of weeks and she said i could take a holiday from it if i wanted to but that i really needed to continue it to reduce my cancer recurrence risks i have been off of it for just 10 days and am no longer ready to hurt myself or anyone else my energy has come back to about half of what it was before starting it pain is improving and i hope that this continues to improve over the next couple weeks i appreciate the comments about how long it does take for to get out of your system because i was beginning to get a little concerned and now am a lot more hopeful my oncologist says that most women do not have these severe reactions and i am glad that i at least gave it a try i may start it again in the future when i am stronger and feeling better but generally my goal is to become completely drug free because just really sick of taking drugs to treat the side effects of the other drugs and having side effects from those drugs i hope to reduce my risks through more aggressive exercise and other lifestyle changes i too have been a vegetarian for the last dozen years but have led a high stress lifestyle overall issues are of more importance to me than cancer recurrence right now lexislove i stocked up on stool softeners before i started chemo and you know it i had diarrhea not constipation go figure but i think it is a good idea to get stocked up on the supplements you will need before starting i took tamoxifen at bedtime so i continue to take femara at bedtime too i noticed much in the way of of course i still get hot flashes in the evening and i have some stiffness but i had that with tamoxifen too it has only been 2 weeks so we shall see good luck to all of us harley hi there i am glad to hear there are people i can relate to i am a 27 year old who was diagnosed in july 07 with stage ii idc nodes and i am currently on herceptin i have developed congestive heart failure unfort from the treatment so my reconstructive surgery has been delayed very depressing i would love to chat with someone off this forum my email is i love reading these boards because i feel like the ladies here are the only people who really know firsthand what we are all going through plus the humor really helps i had my last taxotere on march 15 the chemo brain is gone but i do remember telling my husband that he trust me to remember anything the week after chemo like did you feed the dog hmmmm i dunno i just felt like a gray curtain had been drawn around me however that said the fatigue is hanging on like a stalker i am having bmx this coming thursday so i expect tobe doing handstandsanytime soon i still have 5 weeks of rads and from what i read on the radiation boards fatigue is a common se so when will the energy come back i really miss my eyelashes but i mostly miss feeling like my old self now i just feel old of course none of this comparesto the 3rd day after chemo when the bone pain and all over achiness engulfed me so i am grateful for that and especiallygrateful that my recent mri showed no evidence of the previously noted ilc so the chemo did indeed do what it was designed to do but i look forward to the day wheni can say only tired because we spent a whirlwind week on a trip and we walked all over pick one paris rome or even pittsburgh i was diagnosed in august 05 and began chemo in september i had 4 cycles of treatment every 2 weeks then 32 times of radiation i am now on the second of 4 treatments of taxol nausea is not a problem this time but there is a lot of pain in my legs and knees they think it may be the neulasta shot but i had them with the first four and never had a problem i teach prek and take a week off and then go back for a week i hope i make it back this time i am scheduled to go back tomorrow and my legs are still hurting good to talk to others going through this i have to agree with everyone here taxol is for most of us way easier than ac i felt almost normal during taxol especially compared to what just been through yeah you probably be able to taste your food and your fingers toes will tingle but you should have lots more energy and no nausea your halfway done with chemo yeah scheduled for my ooph on june 15th been doing lupron injections since january in march my onc decided my levels dropping quickly enough for him and anticipated be on lupron longer than he would like so he recommended the ooph continued with lupron injections until my surgery once i have my surgery start on an ai have you tried tamoxifen at all yet typically given to premenopausal women until they reach menopause either surgically chemically or naturally and then they are switched to an ai i had trouble tolerating the ses of tamoxifen but many women do fine on it your doctor might be suggesting an ooph instead of lupron zoladex injections due to your young age 52 and my onc agreed to lupron because he think i was far out from natural menopause he said he like his patients on lupron long term because of ses from it best of luck to you as you navigate your course of treatment hi i hope this helps i was diagnosed with idc stage 2 with her 2 positive and estrogen and progesterone negative they thought i had hot spots on my lungs and said i could be a stage iv candidate because of the pet scan i had with my diagnosis i was given taxotere and carboplatnum with herceptin it will be one year for my herceptin in august 2010 not sure if doctor will keep me on it i heard that some patients stay on the herceptin longer than one year if helping the chemo works for us but my cancer is aggressive so checked every 3 months the doctor used the word controlling the cancer not sure if bad or good but most likely you will go on the same three unless your doctor thinks something will work better i got it every 3 weeks and the taxotere made me lose my hair i hope everything works out for you i hope this info is helping to you 4444444444 4 letrozole is slowly killing me i hate it aches pains neuropathy wow when did i say i was happy with it i must have meant something elseits awful but you may do ok some do hello all i d like to take a few minutes to tell of the positive effect of tamoxifen i was on tamoxifen for 5 yrs i had some side effects like hot flashes some vagina dryness weight gain but i also have had no recurrence and am 15 yrs cancer free this december 17th so i just wanted to tell of the positive thanks msphil log in to post a reply i did much better on the taxol although i had some strange that no one could account for abdominal cramping day 2 after tx so i guess just a freak of nature but it was wwwaaayy better than a c going to make it and be fine i just feel it take care sharon the side effects all depended on which chemo taxol was awful the aches and neuropathy i just took pain killers when it was bad it also affected my blood counts but to counteract that i got neupogin shots my onc eventually stopped it the side effects were taking too much of a toll on my body even though the chemo was working right now on gemzar and it is a dream no side effects other thanmy platelets get low and i sometimes have to skip a chemo i wish all chemos were as gentle so as you said if it comes to it there is chemo but since you are doing fine now wonderful hugs elizabeth i looked at that bottle of tamoxifen on my counter for a week before i would start it i was taken off it for 5 weeks when i had my ovaries were out and again want to start it but was scared to go on one of the ais so i asked to stay on tamoxifen so i know all about not wanting to start new drugs i am thinking of taking some natural things for my hot flashes but also scared to take them so instead i been waking up sooo hot so i guess i may have to just take the plunge and try some black colash good luck cindy my oncologist said the skin thing is from the taxotere and decadron she said that unfortunately since i had that reaction with the first dose that i will most likely get it with every dose that sucks i was busting out zits for about 3 days but then it dried up i even have zits when i was a teenager but now i know what it would feel like it is embarrassing my whole nose and hairline and my chest was full of whiteheads gross i feel well now just a bit more tired than usual but still functional and not sleeping during the day my white blood cell count is very low i hope they give me neulasta next time so i have to worry about being neutropenic as far as your stomach bloating and abdominal pain sure it is from the decadron perhaps you can ask you oncologist in addition to giving you a proton pump inhibitor let them give you something wimpy like pepcid ask for something like prevacid instead you can ask if you can go down on your decadron dose not certain if they will say yes or even if it is safe to but my oncologist mentioned to me that as the treatments go on if i have a lot of problems with the decadron that we could negotiate a lower dose the loose stool problem is still around but definately better than before only occurs about twice a day and i agree i rather be on the loose side than constipated i also developed 2 mouth sores which told is a less common side effect of the chemo and they are a bit uncomfortable but they are healing with the aid of some mouth wash my oncologist prescribed overalll the every three week regimen seems to be doable also nice to know that i have some time in between treatments to recover mentally and physically good luck what ever you decide will be the right decision for you and works just as well for the cancer leslie hello everyone i just happened upon this site forum had bilateral mastectomies jan 2007 without reconstruction 6 rounds of chemo with taxotere cytoxan and adriamycin kicked me good 6 weeks of radiation and been on arimidex for just over 24 months that part of the treatment has been tolerable but has several annoying side effects bone pain sore muscles insomnia depression anxiety headaches and things like that not everyone has them but for some women they are so intense they quit the tratment i take lots of calcium and extra vit d which is supposed to help with bone pain something for depression along with the arimidex and trying all kinds of things for the insomnia grateful that treatments have progressed so much my mother had cancer in the early 60s and the surgery that was standard in those days was very radical she underwent cobalt radiation which really causes severe burns and there were no support groups 3 more years left to that treatment my partner and i have been together for 29 years and my hero held me up during chemo brain days and other times when i felt so sick i sure i could take the 6 chemo treatments we were married in june 2008 shortly it was legalized in ca yipee i had my own business for 7 years but it went down the tubes with the new economic picture and i just started a new full time job which requires lots of walking bending and some lifting to that will keep me active when i feel like going to the gym stay strong and happy holidays been on tamoxifen for 13 months put on over a stone and find it hard to lose any weight get the joint pain specially in the ankles burning sensation aching and of course the hot flushes also cold spells also had the cramping you mention something never experienced before i went to see my cancer dr yesterday and he said i could take a break from tamoxifen to see if it would my tolerance or something anyway we also discussed its benefit potential for preventing a breast cancer recurrence i was shocked to learn that for my diagnosis etc that tamoxifen only improves my potential for a recurrence of breast cancer by 6 his suggestion was that i could even consider stopping it since it was causing so many side effects and affecting my quality of life course tamoxifen is only for breast cancer estrogen related so it stop it from spreading elsewhere if my fate so to speak if i keep taking it his advice was to prescribe effexor an antidepressant which apparently has a side effect of lessening hot flashes not a tablet taker to begin with so the thought of taking meds for another med appealing right now seriously considering stopping tamoxifen i hope you cope with it okay but nothing has got better for me in my year or so on it thank you isabel so far feeling well on the tamoxifen just one week down no side effects yet as far as the hot flashes they started with the taxol back in may i still get them though much less now and i really think acupuncture may have helped that i went regularly through radiation and when i mentioned an improvement in the hot flashes they told me that often happens with successful acupuncture therapy i lost 10 lbs while in radiation perhaps dietary changes i loaded up on protein they recommended 90 grams day so there was little room for carbs perhaps the weight shed due to increased metabolic demands on a body healing from radiation i hope to keep it off and hope that starting an exercise program at this time will help to balance any potential weight gain from tamoxifen this is my plan i have learned this year that things always work out as i plan i will give it my best shot marcy 4 and dancermel 28 sorry had such a rough time getting your chemo cocktails figured out lauram i had blisters knock on wood but my heels are cracked i do try to moisturize them when doing my arms but usually i forget those of you who have already done taxol have you had bone and muscle pains one of the side effects the onco warned me about which i thought was just great since i already get plenty of that thank you very much from the neupogen i had my first taxol on monday and did pretty well for a couple of days then yesterday started feeling really achy it feels more like a bad version of the overall body aches you get with the flu than the usual deep pain from the neupogen and i start this shots until today i needed to take some pain stuff in order to sleep last night and here i thought i was going to get off easy with few ses karen i have been taking tamoxifin for over 2 years i haved bad varicose veins and planning on some treatment as soon as we find something i might not be allergic too years ago i had some treatment but they have new things they do today and some could make me have heart problems i have leg pain but imo it is my varicose veins i worry when i get my treatments should i hold off the tamox while healing since sometime complications with vein therapy is blood clots and not sure i should take tamox for a period of a few days or a couple weeks i just have so many questions with this i need to talk to my doctor check with your doctor i went to my vein doctor yesterday he squeezed my leg and omg i was in pain all day yesterday lynn smith i am going to be starting my second round of chemo next week i did 6months of taxol last year and lost my hair gained a ton of weight and then for 6 months took tomaxifen and zoladex the hormonal inhibitors kicking butt anymore so we aretrying doxil has anyonehad only doxiliv therapy did you lose your hair the onc nurses are telling me i loseall my hair but it is a less common side affect any one want to chat me up on their side affects joy well i am now a year out of treatment for idc snd in right breast dx 2 was lumpectomy not all cancer removed close to chest wall found on yearly mammogram no palpable lump second surgery month later a partial mastectomy all cancer removed sentinel node disease estrogen idc stage 2 chemo adriamycin cytoxin taxol gemzar 06 radiation 07 presently on tamoxifen daily menopause was until day of taxol in complete menopause since that day history no cancer in family at all lumpectomy in 2004 on left breast benign lump removed now lump felt by me went to gyn for annual exam 2 weeks ago tell her wanted to see if she felt it she did went off for a bilateral breast mri w contrast dye surgeon consult she felt lump as well mri shows nothing suspicious lump still there mammogram ultrasound biopsy march 24th return to oncologist and surgeon week after no periods so therefore no more lumpy fibrocystic breast tissue since oct 06 just venting i guess as of course no one around me has any clue that i may be worrying about this we thought adding gemzar to the chemo protocol as a clinical trial tho gemzar is used now for not a new drug which is why i chose to participate so not really asking for advice my significant other knows and is very supportive he works 365 days a year only was able to take my 2 surgery days off to be with me as i drive other than that i drove myself to all chemo radiation treatments will do so again as family lives too far and i do not burden my family with knowing anything yet and then when i do tell them after a plan has been made same as last time and i did not have any of my adult kids nor my mom come and stay with me to what babysit drive me want them to live their lives no need to worry about me tough i am also disabled with daily migraines nausea so driving to in the past was just a given with a of 20 years driving while vomiting dwv lol i stay positive just hate the waiting game there are others out there who had the same experience love to hear what happened to you if i do have cancer in that breast pretty sure opt for full mastectomy this time just remove both breasts as i was not supposed to get idc in the first place see what tests show i guess gotta stay positive that just a lump all my best to you all this is a battle one that i hope all committed to surviving thanx for listening to this long rant vent juli i am on the doxil every four week plan i had three last spring a 2 month break for mastectomy and am on week 3 of last infusion i work full time and am able to do that on doxil but my weekends are spent sleeping i just spent my labor day up in the mountains sleeping beginning to worry that be able to keep up with work if on doxil much longer i had much nausea this time around last spring i had one random day in the four weeks that i threw up all day each round i had that this time around the doxil has worked pretty well for me and the are a lot less than any other chemo had so far a fan of doxil let you know after a few more treatments hope your vacation went well and you had all the energy you needed april congratulations your done i finished only 4 cycles of tchp i felt so horrible and had numbness too been 4 weeks monday i feel pretty good and can taste food better have fatigue but i can get out and walk my hair is starting to grow but it looks like it may take years i did one herceptin only infusion some achy ness for a couple days the biggest se i still have is drippy eyes special k said it was taxotears lolwhat are your next steps so happy you made it to the other side patty hi i was dxed at 42 after chemo i was on tamoxifen with few side effects i had an ooph at 43 my oncologist kept me on tamoxifen for 3 additional months and then moved me to an ai she want to completely deplete my body of all its estrogen at once looking back i wish i would have stayed on tamoxifen for a few more years and then switched to the i handled it well and had less serious side effects the have caused osteoporosis and high cholesterol and that has been with avery healthydiet and lots of exercise also there is a thread on this forum by the monitors call timing is key in survival rates that supports better outcomes if you stay on tamoxifen for a few years and then switch to the i had a better quality of life and better bone density on tamox hope this helps as you have a profile or signature or whatever it is called on this board that says what you have been through i say but for me yes her 2 and there is a new antibody called perjetta that goes with herceptin it was fda fastracked for pre surgery so i still have the stupid cancer in my body but am doing 6 rounds of chemo taxotere carboplatin herceptin and perjetta then surgery then possibly radiation and will continue the herceptin every 3 weeks to finish a 12 month cycle my first chemo the big d was so bad i thought i was going to die or at least pass out we have a toilet room in our master bath i made my husband stay there i was too scared to be embarrassed mind you it is better now i realized constipation played a huge role in the pain so fixed that problem after the first chemo i wondered how anyone did chemo 2 but i did i have a 7 year old and 10 year old twins i had no option i need to live and with her 2 i would have to have chemo either before or after when you are given the opportunity to find something get it checked out asap before it becomes bigger and more difficult to fix call the doctor monday morning once you know what it is and how to treat it then this question one of the girls under 40 at my treatment center comes with her mom her mom was diagnosed 5 years ago with stage 4 her 2 cancer it was in her bones like all through out them and in her lungs and liver only place it was her brain she did taxotere carboplatin and herceptin every 3 weeks for 12 months at the end the pet scan said no cancer even the cancer in the breast was completely gone she even have a lumpectomy although they will have her on herceptin for life she has been ned no evidence of disease since her 12 months of every 3 week chemo ended btw she was around 65 when diagnosed so my guess is those 12 months were horrible they say she lived on ensure with ice cream milk shakes but she has now seen her grandchild born and turn into a healthy 4 year old so yes although it absolutely terrifies me to think i may go through this again i would evening jewels hope youre all well heres a switch ive been taking care of dh he came down with a

be joining you on thursday for taxol 2 i saw the np today onco was on hospital duty the rash id reported several days ago on the knuckles and treated with cortaid has pretty much gone away only to

with the four ac txs shes going to check on the steroid dose with onco in the mean time np said to put cortaid on it and switch back to the old face lotion vettegal what is it with brothers anyway my

a lot of repetitive motions but sometimes it be helped as with clipping bushes gardening etc i am careful not to have bp checks or blood draws on that arm i think an id bracelet is a great idea just in case i have been on anastrozole for 11weeks now with minimal side effects and the leg cramps i was having at night have been resolved by placing 2 bars of ivory soap under the bottom sheet of my bed at night i say why that works but it certainly has for me sheree heartfelt prayers for your son that this brain tumor be just a small bump in the road that it be easily overcome taxol 1 update had syndrome swelling and burning red hands and feet but it seems to be going away yay it helps so much that one of my oldest friends is here cooking and insisting on doing all my dishes as wear dish gloves and hot water will exacerbate hand itching etc arm and leg and joint bone pain dilaudid every 3 hours miserable not sure what to do besides wait it out still queasy taking kytril but it seems dealable and not as bad as a c but all in all this as bad as a c i still feel poisoned but less so and this being treatment 5 of 8 that homestretch is tantalizingly in sight i can do this alyssa i thought about shaving mine off early too but decided to just get a short cut to start off with it helped me to get adjusted to having shorter hair so the final buzzing too traumatic you are on the same tx as me i am on dose dense a c 4xfollowed by taxol 4x i just had my 2nd tx on thursday i start losing my hair until day 16 after the 1st tx so you still have some time unless you really want it

in fingers and toes after my first taxol and had muscle and joint pain day 4 aleve helped some as did exercise and warm bath fingers and toes feel odd still but not bad today obviously denial is a big

the whole chemo thing without it ddkath your husband is a rock star give him a big high five from me and regarding the bone pain taxotere can also cause some serious body pains and in combination with the neulasta it can get pretty nasty be sure to mention it to your mo if he thinks due to the taxotere there are things he can do to help anyone nose run all the time seriously too bad not a market for snot i could totally cash in hello fellow triple positives newly joining so please forgive me if asking topics already covered by this proliferic group 1 perjeta taking it mo think that chemical burns blisters on my face are from the perjeta anyone else experience this 2 worried about tamoxifen her 2 crosstalk what do i need to have tested to find out whether in danger what are the markers 3 my mo is planning to start me on tamoxifen right after tchp during the continued h any tips for what to take avoid with tamoxifen it looks like been discussing vitamin d but i sure whether it is recommended and whether there is anything else recommended 4 i had read that the aromitase inhibitors perform better than tamoxifen but done having children so do not qualify why do i not seem to hear recommendations to take out the ovaries and use the aromatase inhibitors read that tamoxifen increases risk of uteran and ovarian cancer why not just take everything out avoid tamoxifen and go straight to the aromatase inhibitors i know that there is osteoporosis risk with the aromitase is this why why is ovary abilation hardly mentioned it must do something bad that not aware of thank you ladies for any incite hi i noticed any severe side effects from taking aromasin i started it at the end of sept back in july after i finished chemo my med oncologist said i could choose the ai that i would take reading through the posts here made me very confused it seemed like none of the drugs was problem free just because i have a pain when on aromasin it mean the aromasin caused it when you have arthritis diabetes high blood pressure etc you always tellwhich one is causing the pain or if it might evenbe something left over from the taxol treatment the aromasin is neveralone i too have lost some weight the past few months able to go to my water aerobics 3 times a week and i feelgreat most of the time i tested totally menopausal after chemo but the little sneaks started making small quantities of estrogen again no symptoms or periods i had been on an ai since chemo treatment when i was dx with mets recently the first thing my onc did was to start me on zoladex my estradiol levels had bounced back up he told me to discontinue my ai at that time and to wait until i was menopausal again since i just had my ooph we now know i am menopausal so i have started back on my ai at my recent dx the treatment plan he outlined was to use either zoladex or ooph to get me menopausal again then start back on the ai and also to start zometa infusions for the bone mets go get that arimidex asap good cherri when i had a yeast infection one of the lovely ladies here suggested keeping a spray bottle filled with water in the bathroom then after you pee spray yourself like crazy to cleanse i found that it did help while i was waiting for the med to kick in the sitz bath and vinegar in bath water sound like good ideas if worried about it burning try dabbing a tiny bit of the diluted solution on yourself first then have the spray bottle handy just in case you need to wash it off hope you get relief soon aaoaao my hero i pray that i can handle this with some of your grace and wisdom sue i guess i lost track and didnt realize you were so close to the finish line congrats thats awesome funny story about your son im surprised you muscling the truck out of the mud yourself rambo glad feeling up for going to game hope that means the hemorrhoids are better how strange that talking to strangers about yeast infections and hemorroids with my first taxol i was very sleepy for a couple hours from the benedryl then got wired later that evening and the next day from steroids so for me that night was ok but see what others say day 9 after the first taxol and still soooo tired i drive my kids to school which takes about 45 minutes round trip then i have to come home and lay down thought i was going to faint in the grocery store a couple days ago still achy and not sleeping well i thought it would be better by now admire all of you who are able to work and do fun stuff funny to me how doctors and nurses always know which ones cause hair loss maybe they administer so much they know it would be really rare not to lose hair on taxotere mine started on day 14 and was gone by day 21 my doctor also thought i would not lose it on abraxane and the nurses sure the brochure they gave me said it causes hair loss in 90 of people why they know that i have only had one treatment but my head already has that tingly hurting feeling like it gets before it falls out be really surprised if i bald by the end of april i have a wedding too my stepdaughter is getting married i hate wigs very much so uncomfortable but i bought a close match for my natural hair so i look normal at the wedding take attention off the bride i started losing my hair on day 14 and had my mom shave it that same day it sucks but not that bad i never wore my wig just scarves and hats i never completely lost my eyebrows and eyelashes so far that is but they look like been in a cat fight i attended the look good feel better program which i liked a lot i also concur that important to treat symptoms right away make you feel much better i never developed thrush but the big c has been an issue so i also take stool softeners and magnesium i also use the biotene brand of toothpaste and mouthwash and kept the mouth issues in control as for neuropathy less common with taxotere than taxol had some tingling especially the first few days after each tx but it goes away completely before the next infusion cynthia bumping i am interested too i am 36 and took a break from tamoxifen a week ago due to night sweats and fatigue i am still experiencing night sweats and fatigue even after being off tamoxifen for a week i would like to know what others have experienced when getting off for a break or for good i have taken arimidex for almost 3 years and live in fear of breaking a bone by losing my balance or slipping etc i am in physical therapy for my neck right something and bulging discs it seems like arimidex has so many side effects and clearly osteoporosis is one of them but now i have become lactose intolerant there goes much of the natural do drink the lactose free milk i realize that the battle and the little fires never really go away we must stay strong follow the orders and do all we can for ourselves every day and now i hope i take my own advice sessna you are an absolute wonder i am so sorry to hear about your leg you should start a collection of stories not that they are entertaining but they way you tell us about them is very entertaining leisa welcome sorry you are having such a hard time with the radiation indeed it does not sound like a pleasant thing and i can only pray that you begin healing quickly hugs lini and 3jays welcome as well our table sure has gotten bigger over the past year nice to have the company jane i so agree of all the things i hate about this disease i think that children get it is the hardest it is just beyond not fair prayers for your radiation buddy and jacob alike i must warn you all mine is much more than an ios an angry rant i get that i am very lucky to have a stage one cancer i get that i want it to come back and treating a stage iv is hardger than taking that damn pill every day that does not make it any easier to wake up with so much joint pain that i reall really could call out sick from work wtf i am not even 4 weeks into my second ai and already my knees are killing me my back is killing me and my shoulder which already has a touch of arthritis in it from an old softball injury hurts so bad i could cry i finally finally had my ankle replaced and ejoyed a blissfull 4 weeks without the joint pain that has plagued me for years now with the addition of femara to my system i am right back to square one the thought of having to go another 4 years 11 months with this joint pain makes me want to throw in the towel yes i know to keep moving i am but it makes the knees worse not better i already had the fatigue which thrill me but not having kids i at least can go to bed early each night and nap on the weekends if need be but living in constant pain is going to drive me insane this disease sucks these drugs suck and having to choose between second guessing quitting should a reoccurrance come in the door or living like this sucks f ck cancer and all of bullsh t treatments that rob us of our peaceful lives thanks i needed to get that out of my system before i lost it a big that sucks to all who need it and a shout out to my friend traci sorry we chatted lately but thinking of you as always and hoping things continue to improve starting to have some hope again with regard to my post mastectomy pain went to a new physical therapist today who works within a burn trauma center i went to 50 physical therapy sessions at another center after my big surgery last july and i came a long way there but still not pain free or full range of motion this new pt focused a lot on nerve pain and nerve mobilization exercises for my arm shoulder axillary and pec muscle pain but will also address lymphedema and my axillary cording issue also starting amindfulness based stress reduction program that is specifically for pain patients in the complementary medicine department it is facilitated by an md who had to give up her practice because of illness it meets weekly for 8 weeks for 2 hours and has a full day session on one weekend i wish my insurance paid for this like it did for my psychologist who incorporated a little of mindfulness training into my couch session meanwhile i still take oxycodone daily although no longer take the valium someday i hope i can get relief from this pain so i can try to take the tamoxifen again which had added debilitating se pain to the pmps pain otherwise i will just forego the tamoxifen for quality of life hi arlenea i did 3x tch and had to stop before the final 4th kept on with just the herceptin 1st week extremely tired 2nd week felt better 3rd week felt pretty good then time to start over 8 weeks ago started the generic arimidex and the palpatations started by week 6 i could hardly move and one day cried non stop for 4 hours i stopped taking it and felt better right away but the palpatations continue along with the anxiety seeing the oncologist on tuesday and know he will want me to try another ai but they are all the same from what i have read hi smiler i have had gastritis since starting tamoxifen but know whether it was caused by the tamoxifen or possibly the chemo my doctor says that tamoxifen cause gastritis but i think i was reacting to the lactose in the tablets because i have a milk allergy i never knew before that i had a problem with lactose because my reaction was to the protein part of the research done on the internet says that lactose intolerance and milk protein allergy are entirely different and not likely to be present together it say why apparently nolvadex is a form of tamoxifen that contain lactose so i am going to give it a try i stopped taking tamoxifen for a short while recently to see if the gastritis would settle down and it did in fact i had to stop because the symptoms were so intolerable it was a struggle every day to eat and drink enough and i was losing weight continually every time i told the doctors about this they just ignored it which still makes me angry only when i stopped taking it they started to listen i should be able to get novladex soon so will let you know how it goes yes my mo did a clinical trial on it while i was on taxol i had almost no neuropathy at all just some light temperature sensitivity tho i know dd and weekly are not the same dose out of 38 women none had neuropathy greater than that i know when publishing it but the researchers i worked with were very very pleased they seem to feel that the 15 mins prior to starting taxol being iced and the 15 mins after taxol stopping being iced were the most important i would think it hurt to try they iced me 15 mins before all during and 15 mins after i was also concerned about heart damage and also hair loss at the first mention of chemo i expressed to my mo about my concern for heart damage he suggested tc need h which he thought was the best course for me anyway after reading i was very concerned about hair loss the 6 is not 6 never getting hair back but insufficient growth some say 3 others say 6 my mo said he has had 2 patients have insufficient growth but they bald so i considered taxol which he was fine with taxol has a high rate of neuropathy so i asked myself in a worst case scenario would i rather be bald or crippled for life i chose bald so i went with taxotere for you it might be would you rather be bald or have heart damage neither are likily but which could you live with better i am guessing being bald in the end all my hair came back full and thick the usual s es of femara are night sweats hot flashes weight gain damn muscle and joint pain and foot swelling i knew that already and a lot like the others he also said he like to put many on tamoxifen because of the chance of blood clots which they other 3 have i think to ask about the long term effect do they even know would they even give out that info they out long enough i like the whole thing either the darn drug effected my liver enzymes after being off for 4 weeks the blood test showed they went down to a normal range a couple of days later mind you artsee i had 4 rounds of a c one round of taxol which i couldnt tolerate then 3 rounds of taxotere i pretty much could predict the bone and muscle aches always kicked in the 3rd day post chemo and lasted for about 3 days i would start taking pain pills the second day post chemo just to stay ahead of things it was hard but i was able to do it and still worked pretty much full time planned my chemo for wednesdays which gave me the weekend to get through the achiness i never had any problems with my eyes i got constipated but i found eating fig newtons fixed that problem i got indigestion and was given protonix and reglan that did the trick i think the hardest thing for me was the fatigue nadola its not going to be as bad as you are imagining just remember to treat the symptoms you develop before you know it it will be all over good luck to you nicki hi twicebitgood to hear that the weight gain issue is positive i hate gaining weight because of meds we work so hard to keep it off you just go from one thing to another you my goodness your body is probably screaming help me do you feel that because of the dx that your breast cancer prognosis is at stake did your onc say anything about that to you gosh i am just a chatter box but it is so nice having someone with the same physical ailments the herceptin alone did not cause me any side effects that were immediate other than going home feeling a bit sluggish and almost like i could get the flu bot the next morning i was fine i did however develope a heart murmur very slight bu there no need for any alarm though now herceptin with the taxol did cause some really sore muscles and bad body aches also had a reaction once to the taxol alone you should do well herceptin saved my butt wait too long on the final decision cuz the best results for herceptin are done either with chemo or directly after up to 6 months from treatments best to buy some lidocane cream for your port cuz its gonna get a work out hahatake care twicebit i am on weekly taxol and herceptinfor 3 weeks with a double dose of herceptin on the 3rd week and then a week off i constantly have a runny nose and i get achy and flu like for 2 days after chemo i also get the diarreah sp and abdominal cramps really bad with the double dose i am so glad to see that other have the same symptoms and it is not all in my head yes my blood pressure is rising and heart rate too seems to be the affinitor as this has never been an issue in the past i am going back in 2 weeks for another check and may need to start blood pressure meds if still rising i have been experiencing awful headaches as well nauseating at times 3 aleve seems to do wonders prednisone definitely works too but taken 3 courses over the last several months for other issues and need to give it a break the weight gain from that has been very unpleasant i do find that the aleve or even prednisone relieves so much of the inflammation that seems to be in overdrive throughout my body i wish i could pinpoint what is causing it afinitor aromasin or even the radiation that i had recently mo seems to think the aromasin that is being made more effective by the afinitor for now taking 2 aleve twice a day for inflammation along with the vicodin for the bone pain seems to be helping i slept for 9 hours last night that happened in forever 6 hours max has been the routine for quite some time because of pain encouraged that the ramp up in pain over the last couple of months may not be the cancer itself but wide spread inflammation anyone doing massage or acupuncture to relive pain and inflammation vicki i did 5 taxotere 06 i recall all of the particulars but a few biggies taxotere can cause fluid retention this was not a problem for me until i flew and then omg i started to get swelling in my legs then of course the flight back and it got worse i could barely fit into my jean i felt like i had elephantitis despite all the bc stuff been able to and have never had the thought can i walk that far but my legs were so heavy with fluid and tired this lasted for almost a month during that time i used lasix furosemide a diuretic and they improved gradually even now just to be safe whenever i fly i wear these ugly orthopedic stockings i bring lasix with me but have not needed it granted been off that treatment a long time but i ve never had a problem since coincidentally a friend of mine from a support group had the same exact thing happen to her legs after she flew too while on t c that icky whitish junk started on my tongue biotin mouthwash found it at my grocery store after drug stores have it worked wonders however it causes some discoloration on your teeth that was fortunately removed by a good cleaning by a dental hygienest as for hair loss already gone thru the trauma of that with ac by the time i was starting t c i had very short hair a far cry from my long hair but did not want to being bald i used hypothermia caps for my hair and gloves and booties to prevent neuropothy and they all worked now doing avastin abraxane and using the products again only had two treatments but so far so good the hypothermia products are by they have a lame website but are of improving it if you have questions probably better to pm me as i usually post here but post on the recurr mets and trip neg sections calgal you all had some great ideas things i think of i brought my kindle my iphone my counted eventually jolly rancher candies which helped with both my dry mouth and the funky taste in my mouth from the taxol kind of oily and nasty and lip balm the whole treatment was about hours start to finish the first few weeks i would fall asleep as soon as the gave me benedryl they would offer either water or ginger ale to drink i never thought to bring snacks they always had blankets and pillows there if needed hoping chemo is something i have to go through again for a long while chris gatorgal i completed my second taxol after 4 rounds of ac much better for me although i am having a new issue hand and foot i have skin sloughing off my feet 0 i find the taxol gives me some mild moderate muscle discomfort in my legs and some fatigue about 3 days out however i am quite anemic these days which is probably contributing to the fatigue just got home from half a day roaming the mall and i a whooped hi all so i did the femara route for 3 years and now 1 of tamoxifen the femara gave me terrible joint pain tamoxifen makes me even call them hot flashes i am dripping wet i tried gabapentin for 6 months some help and now taking a week off worse and about to start low dose can anyone give me hope that this will help can i still enjoy a drink every now and then help log in to post a reply i really want to be there but if all goes as scheduled it will be the day after my 3rd taxol so i know how be feeling taxol has been awful for me i missed 3 days of work this week because of a viral infection still have no energy feel any better i know this too shall pass but right now i feel like a squeezed out sponge ann hi all based just outside cardiff was diagnosed july 2014 had snb wle rads and am now on tamoxifen having major struggle with fatigue caused partly by tamoxifen and partly by hysterectomy i ended up having because of tamoxifen ses i work pretty much full time as a primary teacher been seeing a psychologist at velindrre to help deal with the fatigue and she has suggested joining a support group as the fatigue is making me feel pretty isolated looked into a fair few in the area but they all seem to meet during the day which i do anyone know any groups that meet in the evening 45 so it would be good to meet with women of a similar age who are trying to work and cope with breast cancer fall out thanks hello all add one more to the list for today i just completed my first round of taxol today a little wiped and metal taste has already kicked in i had no idea there was so much alcohol they gave to give this drug i am pretty sure i was drunk in that last hour and slept it off the rest of the afternoon nothing like getting a buzz on at 9 am kidding anyway next round is in three weeks and they are going to mix in the herceptin at that time today was just to find out how i would react to the taxol i was there about 5 hours due to all the premeds emend aloxi benadryl tagamet decadron and the like youcan tell they are doing a lot to prevent side effects feeling a little weak and fatigued right now but it is manageable going to go back to bed soon hope all the rest of you that had the chemo party today are also doing well jillp s the lidocane cream they gave me for the port worked like a dream despite just getting the darn thing put in this pastmonday i put the cream right over the steri strips and it still worked did not even feel it when they accessed it slousha hopefully one of the 2009 sisters will come along and be able to help you unfortunately i am taking arimidex anastozole and i answer your question i initially had started out on tamoxifen myself and gained an enormous amount of weight and my knee joints started having pain and crepitus arthritic sounds since the oncologist changed me to arimidex the pain has improved and so has the crepitus but it has completely reversed itself i also lost any weight but the weight gain has stopped i know if my experience has helped you any but that is all i have to draw upon good luck renee the latest news is that she is now having a bmx after having the lumps it say in the reports but i guess we can assume her margins great i think she is very petite so that help she seem to want rads so i am hoping this works out for her she also want to take tamoxifen and put off her fertility treatments so i guess she is thinking she can have the bmx and get right back to making a baby i read in one report that she hopes to be fully revovered by new eve which i find incredibly optimisitc for a bmx but best of luck to her thank you everyone for your insight on this i think i will ask for a switch i think i have given it enough time to know this feeling is going to stay as long as i continue on the anastrozole anyone on the aromasin had changes with weight while taking it just curious i finished my last taxol april 19 and started herceptin may 31st i did get some neuropathy and it was getting better i receive herceptin every three weeks my last two injections were for thirty minutes and the pain has been worst since weve gone to thirty minutes ill ask my oncologist if longer ivs would help thanks for the suggestion i see my oncologist only on the 11th hi bo i was diagnosed with liver bone mets last april i have been on taxotere cytoxan just completed treatment 6 every 3 weeks and expect to do two more before its over anyway i had a pet scan about 1 month ago now that showed every single place i have cancer is smaller and it is no longer hypermetabolizing like it was in the beginning that included the liver mets i had one 2 cm liver lesion and some small little diffused stuff around it the pet scan recently showed liver met to be cm and doc pointed out it is closing in on itself a good sign apparently and diffused stuff not visible so obviously the taxotere cytoxin is working for the first time so far the doctor let me just have taxotere this time no cytoxin as he saw i was getting pretty beat up and he gave me a little less taxotere as well next time i think we are back to the whole drill but not sure anyway yes the side effects do suck neuropathy in hands and feet which i am hoping will clear up after treatment is done and feeling generally unwell pains etc for a week or so after and of course the hair loss but with some vicodin as necessary i have found it to be doable not torture by any means my first go around with bc was 10yrs ago and i had adrimycin which i found to be very tough drug with lot of yucky nausea etc that was a bad one as far as i was concerned but remember we all do these drugs differently some are harder for one than the other it is pretty individual overall for me the taxotere and cytoxin while no treat has been doable i do laothe all the decadron steroid you gotta take for it think i hate that more than the chemo lol but it is of course necessary anyway i wish you the best and if you have any questions just pm me be happy to help hang in there honey judie orig diag idc er 9 out of 18 nodes positive mets diag mets to scalp bones liver nolvadex versus aps tamoxifen i was on aps tamoxifen for about 7 months and really struggling the hot flushes were quite awful and i tried all the natural remedies but to no effect in desperation i finally rang my oncologist she suggested a blood pressure medication but i just mentioned that i was on aps tamoxifen and she immediately said the first thing to try was to go onto nolvadex she said it would take about three weeks plus to make any difference if it was going to i must admit i was really sceptical they are the same thing they well that was three weeks ago and i suddenly over the past few days am almost beginning to feel like my old self i had no idea how tired and run down i felt until now when i am feeling better i am still getting the hot flushes in the same frequency but they are not lasting as long am i going mad has anyone else had this experience also has anyone out there taken blood pressure medication to treat hot flushes does it work be really interested to hear your views caroline nycgirl i got 4 days of vanco even the nurses just called it that along with another antibiotic infused twice a day the band i was almost as tough on my veins as the ac was i went through three different iv s in 4 days they also have my pills for low potassium and unguided me with magnesium they sprung me last night and home except they still know why i had a fever lolkarolv sorry you got chanced to the boards with troubles but at the same time happy you joined us now that you are done with ac things should get better most people prefer the second half of chemo way more i been so lucky so read my posts lol taxol is not hard on you veins or your heart so that issue should resolve as far as the fever goes i just had my own brush with fever of unknown origin and my oncologist tells me not rare that the cause be found all the tests and cultures came up negative so they just filled me with antibiotics until the fever was gone and my white counts were up so i could fight my own invisible infections if they occur again it sucks but not the end of the world as long as you let the doctors keep the infection in check sure you will be just fine in the end getting there that is so tough hi ladies i was diagnosed with breast cancer in oct 2007 and had a lumpectomy then 4 weeks later had a mastectomy as there was still cancer present in the breast had immediate reconstruction also went through chemo in 2008 and also had zoladex injections for 2 years although it is 3 years on from my chemo and i should be feeling great again i actually feel worse now than back then which sounds a bit crazy but i am so fatigued all the time to be honest i have not been right since my chemo and am very depressed at the moment i think i was so positive throughout my surgery and treatment that everything i have gone through has only hit me after it was all over my ex partner also left me while i was having my chemo which has also had an effect on me i am also now borderline under active thyroid which causes a lot of my fatigue i think too and have heard of other women having thyroid trouble after chemo apparantly but i know how true that is and my periods came back after the zoladex injections and i am in agony all the time i feel like i am in labour the doc thinks i now have possible endometriosis and am due for a laparoscopy in may i just feel like i cope with all these illnesses especially after having breast cancer on top guess i am just wanting to talk to someone really as i am very low at the moment been on here in a very long time so thought i would come and have a look take care everybody joanne xx peggy i started in tamoxifen for 2 months before i had my hysterectomy and then in january last year switched to femera i was on that for one year but when i went back a few weeks ago she said i could try arimidex since i was having joint pain and trouble sleeping with femera she also said that there is one more i can try if arimidex gives me trouble she said that they all do the same thing and the se are different for different people so we will keep trying until i get one that works the best i have been sleeping better lately but i just started arimidex so am not sure if it will get bad again but am hopeful it is gone hey ladies can we talk taxol had my first one and here is what happened to me ay 1 galloping diarrheaday steroided up not feeling too bad but muscle pain pretty bad even sore to touch not sure how much is due to neulasta and how much taxol appetite good mouth and tongue a little white but no sores day 4 steroid crash emotional mess black outlook feeling fluish stuffy nose runny eyes sore throat bone and muscle pain all overday flue feeling continues stuffy nose lots of post nasal drip body aches especially in the low back mild fatigueday stop taking claritin lots of the flu feeling cleared up most of the muscle and bone pain gone natural energy back up mo says this should be my nadir day but with neulasta who knows not being monitored except the day i go in for treatment so no clue what my blood is looking like day stuffy nose and post nasal drip continues but has eased up eyes constantly puffy notice eyelashes and brows have thinned a lot but ankle hair seems to be growing energy back at estimated 50 of healthy normal and 200 better than a c off and on burning feeling in mouth but no real sores appetite still good no nausea i have mild brachial plexus neuropathy but this seems mechanical rather than nerve related whatever it is it primarily affects my thumb whereas the bpn affects my ulnar nerve most also when it happens correspond with the or shooting electric pain i am on arimidex and lupron to chemically induce menopause not tamoxifen i just did a quick google for trigger finger and it does sound like what i am having on the other hand i am on a hefty dose of celebrex 200 mg twice a day so you would think that would keep it under control anyone know if wearing a le glove which keeps the hand in a flexed position can cause trigger finger ks1 avastin combination with xeloda is the one be on avastin is not covered by medical aid in this country my onco told me a story of one of her ovarian patients not been able to bring her counts down in 3 years almost ned now on avastin it appears to be a good one but then again when reading the se of nose bleeds etc and low blood counts it must be a juggle taxotere as a single agent was fine for me for 9 months no hair loss then good luck river i had my final taxol treatment on feb 14th of this year i had significant neuropathy in my hands and my feet throughout the treatment my hands have returned to normal the neuropathy in feet for the most part has gone away except for my toes and the part of my foot right below my toes it has been 7 months since i finished treatment i am wondering how long it is going to take for the neuropathy to completely go away log in to post a reply ok still reading merrily along however i did notice that because of the tamox driven insomnia taking sleeping aids uncommon even though we all tend to think of over the counter stuff as harmless please please check with your onc before taking anything one of the ladies posted a link listing drugs that will interact with tamoxifen broken down into severe moderate and minor drug interactions amongst the severe interactions are benadryl tylenol pm advil pm actifed allergy day night and various forms of acetaminophen i was on taxotere which heard referred to on this board as the evil twin of taxol i have any issues with my nails during chemo but 6 months after they started crumbling nail strengthener seem to help any maybe because the damage was already done and i continued with herceptin and tykerb which kind to nails either anyway i put a ton of super strong clear polish on all my nails and made sure they were kept on the short side that seemed to help keep them together a bit more and moisturize tons to keep the finger splits to a minimum when i get really bad sores around my nails i put on some clindamycin gel and a bandaid or sometimes a strong hydrocortisone and that helps with the healing and swelling i ended taxotere carboplatin herceptin perjeta the first of august had problems w neuropathy in fingers toes feet legs since the 3rd tx but i went ahead w treatment at the advice of my mo since this is a recurrence her 2 and not lots of other options unfortunately there was not a pcr so now after surgery doing adriamycin cytoxan of course the advice of the mo is that it takes up to 2 years to know how much is permanent i have any other medical conditions that might cause neuropathy except chemo but i read one place that said it could be hereditary my dad did develop peripheral neuropathy in his feet around age 90 so one of the nurses at the infusion center said yes cytoxan could cause or aggravate cipn my on line research seems to confirm that yes both andriamycin cytoxan make my neuropathy worse made an appointment w a neurologist for next week and looked up a medical toxologist in my area like all of us quality of life is a big issue w me right now torn about going ahead with the last a c treatment or stopping now also torn about going ahead with radiation since read that can cause additional problems any thoughts or comments will be appreciated all your posts are very valuable hello ladies with you in this rocking boat i started tamox on june 14 and rads on june 25 after dose dense act chemo 49 and in chemopause or maybe in tamopause now golfergirl during both tamox and rads i had more hot flushes than i have now after i finished rads this monday but definitely depression was first on my list of side effects even though i never have had any depression symptoms before not even during chemo i started taking tamox at lunch because i thought i can drink more water after but was a personal preference not knowledge and no weight gain for me i just lost some arm leg muscles as i was not jogging exercising any more this year best wishes to all of you i have been on tamoxifen since oct 2007 had 2 surgeries partial mast for a stage 1 and rads which ended in it me i have had some strange effects my head is actually feel like i have lost iq points i cant remember things almost like a blackout sometimes particularly things that went on the eve before i feel numbness in my brain i feel like i am out of body sometimes i get drunk on one glass of wine i have a difficult time staying awake past 9pm i did gain 20 lbs and have been ferverently exercizing to take it off so far got 15 lbs off my voice is hoarse in the afternoons i am often incontinent when i walk cry at the drop of a dime yikes a mess the brain stuff is the most frightening someone said it is depression but it feels neurological does anyone out there have similar issues happy cancer survivors day hi deb doing ok the taxol is much better than the ac for sure still tired some tingling in the feet the day of tx but no nausea the best part i have had 4 out of 12 tx so far so i hope thingscontinue to go ok i still get the rapid heartbeat but not for as many days as i did on ac why do you have to delay surgeries after avastin i heard that i am on coumadin now since i got a pulmonary embolism last month so i am very nervous about having surgery for reconstruction after chemo i am on coumadin until sept so i will have to put off recon until after then enjoy our lovely weekend coming up 80 degrees hugsjudy it was a bit easier at least for me than 3 fec 3 taxane i had a major issue with avoiding neuropathy so i took my chances with cardiomyopathy instead had the infusion on thursday afternoon took friday off and was back to work on monday i was able to give myself neulasta on friday i took claritin 2 days before and after and luckily did not experience any pain i had a script for odantasedron zofran for nausea took it friday and saturday as a precaution but was not seasick my white cell count dropped by the sixth infusion but was high enough to be in the acceptable range to continue the muga was 51 at the start and 53 at the end virtually the same i stayed hydrated throughout the infusion i look at gatorade i would down 3 bottles during the two hour drip used biotene mouthwash religiously seemed to work better than the bicarbonate lidocaine antibacterial cocktail that the pharmacist made up but just me the ladies with permanent hair loss from taxotere can come and join us at there are hundreds of us that were not warned of the 6 chance of permanent hair loss using taxotere devastating especially when we had options but were not told about them beyond cruel to do this to young early stage girls that now have to live in wigs for the rest of their lives because of this and we even cured just bald just read your post i have been having gi problems for quite a while been on anastrozole for almost 2 years now an i am having problems with stomach cramping loose bowels alternating with constipation and my esophagus spasms have gotten more intense other serious are severe bone and muscle pain weight gain hair loss serious memory loss some confusion insomnia only sleep 3 hours at a time more headaches my husband says my personality has changed as well trying to last for the necessary 5 years but my knees have gotten so bad not sure i can tough it out surprised there are not more members out there with stomach issues hope you are feeling better good luck with your taxotere rounds jayne i hope your are minimal like mine mostly mouth issues and toenails splurge on the biotene mouthwash and use the icepacks on your fingerand toenails let me know how you are doing you can always pm me hello all tamoxifen caused double vision to my wife switched to fareston which is causing upset stomach and nausea are there other drugs similar to tamoxifen fareston for pre menopausal women she is trying to avoid shots to shut down ovaries because then she would be put on arimidex femara which causes joints pain in 100 of people according to what we know dx 2003 idc non palpable 2 cm lump associated dcis wle total axillary clearance 6xfec chemo 25 rads 4 yrs on arimidex stopped 2 months ago due to bone pain in hips fee and hands dx osteopenic 2 yrs ago mainly due to steroids exacerbated by arimidex pain now gone waiting to see new oncologist re alternative ai meds taking alendronate weekly with calcichew vit d3 daily 6 weeks ago got sudden severe nausea total loss of appetite weight loss 14 lbs steatorrhea pain in stomach and urq shoulder neck saw gastro for 38 yrs 2 weeks ago px domperidone omeprazole having ct scan tomorrow on pancreas liver abdomen upper gi endoscopy 26th june been on mg methotrexate 7 yrs lft results fine slightly elevated mcv mch and protein my symptoms sound like pancreatitis or gall bladder but i am concerned that the bc may have spread to the pancreas i know it normally can spread to the liver bones lungs and occasionally brain but wonder if it can spread to the pancreas or gall bladder thank you liz hi ladies seems like all going up and down the emotional rollercoaster i thought after making it through the first tx number two seemed to have less side effects and i would handle it better but strange i cry in the middle of the night because i feel so tired of going through this when i go in the bathroom i avoid looking in the mirror although i tried to embrace my naked head sometimes i just do it i keep thinking done after the 17th be half way done then i just want to cry thinking i do it well obviously i have to what are my choices but it is all so depressing tired of taking pills tired of having pain tired of doctors just tired and over it guess the other thing that is wreaking havoc with my emotions is that it is the holiday season there are so many things to do and traditions i would like to keep and i just have the energy to even think about getting anything done then the holidays will be here and feel guilty that i get everything done i know the people around me family friends understand and not important to them but it is important to me to be somewhat normal anyway i really got the feeling that all riding this roller coaster together thanks deb i also have a probem with taxotere mine breathing so much as cramping in the spine the second treatment they tried something different that seemed to work instead of just pushing taxotere through the iv the also ran some saline solution at the same time this seemed to weaken the taxotore going in and prevented the reaction it was much better for me took a little longer to get the full does administered but once they started the dual lines it resolved the problem thanks for all the responses on vision changes at least i feel like not going blind crazy well maybe crazy but not blind dear drm i too have had 4 instances of tendonitis and i think another problem starting with my hip this is all since october and i have been on letrozole 11 months now the young oncologist last week said to me how can you be sure it is the drug but at least he referred me to a rheumatologist a physio i saw in florida for these injuries issues said that he thinks people taking many cancer drugs including letrozole seem to be more susceptible to reptitive strain type injuries it is very very frustrating a year ago i felt 40 age 59 and now i feel 80 i have also been referred to the homeopathic hospital at square london to see if they have any suggestions for the joint pain and menopausal symptoms i have found that heat bath hot water bottle hot tub on holiday all help the general joint pain but i think it will be continual physiotherapy and exercises that repair the injured tendons you are not alone just keep trying things and sharing information hi pam i am on a mini dose of elavil due to fibromyalgia and it worked just fine the whole five years with tamoxifen i know if enough to help w depression tho i never had nausea at all you might want to try running this one by your onc good luck to you andi i had 6 rounds of taxotere carboplatin herceptin perjeta my feet are blocks of ice toes balls of the feet up several inches above my ankles my fingers are also numb after surgery and different ac chemo when i went back on herceptin we did delete the perjeta since their web site lists neuropathy as a side effect only 2 more months with the herceptin there is a good neuropathy thread on bco i did go to a neurologist who finally admitted that while 70 of patients get better that will be better as a relative term will not likely ever get back to where it was before chemo and it can take up to 2 years for feeling to come back just hoping i be in that 30 who get any improvement luck i have been taking tamoxifen for now 2 months few hot flashes at night is about all i have experienced decreased appetite too resulting in weight loss which i needed to do anyway hope you keep taking it and give it a try may not be anything to dread and helps keep us cancer free hi beachbum neither xeloda nor navelbine caused my hair to fall out it until i hit abraxane my 3rd chemo drug since turning stage iv that it did and abraxane is taxol with a fat molecule attached so they may not want to put you on that anyway now graduated to doxil and my hair is slowly growing back i think the onc will put me on halaven next i asked about the hair issues with it not entirely sure i want to know yet in terms of side effects the easiest was navelbine i needed to nap a lot and while i like that se pretty benign a close race for me between xeloda and abraxane in terms of which had the worse side effects i had major hand foot syndrome with xeloda very painful and finally had to discontinue the drug because of that abraxane has given me neuropathy in my hands and feet and i was quite dizzy and shortness of breath got worse now on doxil and after 2 doses i think i have some combo of hand neuropathy and hand foot syndrome the palms of my hands are really painful all that said not everyone gets this hand foot syndrome so fret over that yet i think the neuroopathy numbness and tingling is pretty common with abraxane and mostly just a pain in the ass to have trouble doing fine motor things now but as i said they may not even want to use that one on and hugs calico theresa you know a lot about this from being a nurse but i know you gone through it yourself everyone is different but my experience was the a c extremelybad itself just the loss of hair and the taste food tummy issues but the thing that i think everyone agrees with is that the neulasta is what kicked our butts but we understand importance i basically felt pretty good wired on steroids for two days until the neulasta then was a total potatoe for two more days then by the 5th 6th day things got relatively back to normal and i was ok except for the food taste issues until the next treatment be prepared to find food that you can eat even if you have to live on the same stuff for 8 weeks mine was only the following applesauce yogurt puddings chicken soup rice bananas and tell your doc if you need some protonix or something for the acid reflux i never had any tummy issues stomach of iron until chemo as as nurse you know drink drink drink i could feel when i needed to increase my drinking because my digestive symptoms got worse it should be flush flush flush get agressive with the constipation too phillips caps have become my lil friends i started the taxotere and thought that it was a breeze but it too is becoming cumulative but other than the increasing tiredness and some redeveloping taste food issues still not as rough as the a c was but the a c was only bad for the first days for me i still think the neulasta is what makes the a c suck but my blood counts were above normal so it works hey i still played with my rock n roll band every weekend learn to adjust your schedule to fit your treatment schedule and the effects you can do this fine and you have great support one thing discovered about myself more flexible than i thought i can do things i never thought i could do and i can handle more than i ever thought i could handle come to think about it doing pretty good at 55 and going to do even better at 56 the old saying is true not getting older getting better hum so confusing trying to calculate exactly what one is going to experience when taking chemo and radiation i wish and asked to take the abraxane but it also has side effects the steroids are required with taxol and i did not want to take steroids allergic to prednizone and others so i knew what could happen and it happened but no steroids no taxol i begged for the abraxane is it also called doctaxol and it was apparantly not an available option at the time recently read that it is even more effective at fighting off cancer cells than taxol also read that doctaxol is extremely expensive and that sometimes clinics offer it because the insurance companies refuse to pay the added cost also read they have arrangements insurance co pharmaceutical co and chemo clincs if you know what i mean peripheral neuropathy is just one of the taxol side effects it can affect joints tissues muscles and the entire nervous system just depends on how your body reacts and how well one tolerates pain this is what been told along with the fact that the numbness and pain are supposed to gradually fade away in time last 12 wk taxol treatment was august 06 i think the pain was masked by the massive amounts of steroids decadron which stayed in my system for some time radiation treatments seemed to activate the fatique mucle weakness nerve numbness and pain throughout my entire body hands and feet are still numb and new pains keep getting worse particularly in the left armpit shoulders and hands and underneath the breast left surgery side tried b6 b 12 pain pills and some others took anaesp during the taxol treatment who knows doctors say lyrica will not help nor will neurontin and it would likely make my problems worse hip and leg pain what is that about yikes new and troublesome the onc and surgeon say i am ned so not to worry right having the first bilateral digital mammogram next wednesday along with a visit the next day to oncologist trying to put together a list of questions but never seem to get it right also seeing a new obgyn for first sort of 2nd exam the same morning as the onc sppt so i am hoping she will help to guide me as to how i should be handling all these oddball sysmptoms somewhat annoyed because the lack of counseling and unexpected longterm side effects were never mentioned want to alarm you but ask research and find out all you can from your oncologogist and hopefully obgyn so tired of trying to understand doctor talk and lingo love my family doc but so busy amazing she remembers her own name let alone all the illness and overload of patients she sees she been the best however good luck and i will look into the eucirin calming cream someone mentioned sorry for the long winded comments but this neuropathy and muscle tissue deep burning pain neck shoulder all of it has me on the verge of madness indi i got my taxol today too benadryl relaxed me but didnt get a deep sleep to many folks going in and out the room but it was nice to rest it was my 3 rd of 6 and my feet tingle some and my left hand kind hurts in the palm doc didnt seem to think it was a big deal and really it isnt right now but i am afraid it might get worse i remember back in some post someone said use tree oil on the nails is anyone doing that and if so how does it help i wanted to ask bout the l gluten how many should i be taking a day the b6 i read somewhere is good to take too my white blood count went down and is low starting out this time so who knows where i will be with this one is there a vitamin i can take to help with that thanks anyone who can give me some input on getting through these last 3 taxol i was on the weekly taxol andsince it was not dose dense like when i was first treated it was easier there were aches but they could be managed with regular pain pills i remember if i got steriods with it though the neuropathy eventually caught up with me and i had to stop the taxol even though it was working but it was well worth it taxol kicks cancer butt i just had hyst ooph three weeks ago my surgical oncologist told me that my risk of recurrence is so low lower than my risk of ses thati could stop the tamoxifen my oncologist is adamant that i stay on it i stopped about 10 days prior to surgery and have not begun taking it again yet the more i read up on it the more anxious i am beginning to feel and i think i should start up again i had no noticeable side effects other than some fat redistribution to my waist area despite losing weight this past year my ps was kind enough to do some lipo there three weeks ago while i was under for the hysterectomy robin your story is quite compelling i would be so upset with myself if i had a recurrence and taking the med after everything else i have mast ooph exercising eating better i think what bothers me more than anything is my plan to switch me to arimidex in another year i have scoliosis and wake up with a stiff sore back every morning and the thought of adding joint pain frightens me so glad to find this topic i thought i was nutz i had bilat mx 18 months ago going through reconstruction now onc put me on arimadex i lasted only 4 months the side effects for me were awful the joint pain was so bad i needed vicodin just to move about and to get to sleep hot flashes were out of control onc switched me to tamoxifen i have every side effect listed on this as well now this month i have learned that i have a fatty liver i have bloating and pain in my upper right abdomen at times its so uncomfortable i am beside myself my onc said no problem tamoxifen didnt cause it fibber i will see my new onc in a week also i will be having my 2 year check up soon is it normal for the onc to order no tests of any kind in 2 years pcp ordred the ultra sound on the liver but they guessed it was fatty liver because they could see it was enlarged but they couldnt see all the way through it so i am going to push for an mri my old onc said he thought it might be my gallbladder ah no i havent had one for 10 years yes lago taxotere and cytoxan still being patient about the hair and still rubbing my nutriox on my head after my shower in the morning and before bed at night the doctor told me not to expect to see anything until the end of april but as usual being short on patience and yes the taxotears and hoarse voice etc are enough to drive you nuts but this too shall pass i just keep saying that to myself jules my husband was born in commack we live in rockland county now but he lived there until he was five or six years old kad 22i have lost more eyebrows and body hair since being on the taxol as well i still have enough brow and lashes to manage but hey definitely are thinning i have had 4 treatments of weekly taxol so far hi guys i started propecia 1pill per day around 12 months ago it stopped my hairloss and restored the full thick head of hair i had in my teenage years im 26 now however i noticed around 4 weeks ago that despite all the exercise i do and low carb high protein dieting my chest just would not look right unless i was cold or pumped from the gym after a bit of internet research i have since come to learn that i suffered gyno most likely caused as a side effect from the propecia it is not as obvious as some of the cases i have seen from people with natural gyno but it is enough to cause me frustration especially as the medication i was taking was for my own selfish vain reasons to look good i have been completely off propecia now for approx 4 weeks and have started a course of letrozole to battle the gyno i do not have painful lumps more like swelling behind slightly under the nipples towards the armpit are so that the nipples are larger and oval shaped when they are warm when im cold they tighten up and i look fine my question is will running a course of letrozole help to minimize gyno that is caused by finesteride how long does it usually take for the letro to kick in thank you for any help in advance there are quite a few oral chemos methotrexate is one and xeloda is another i have not done xeloda but know several women who have and they have not had bad ses with it you can get hand foot syndrome where your hands and feet peel but the women i know on it did not get that bedu how are you doing on the abraxane that was the one that was really hard on me but it worked i got it weekly some peopleseem to tolerate it extremely well but i just handle the ses i am also getting xgeva with no ses i do not get the shot you get but get neulasta to rebuild my white count i take claritin before the injection and also after at the advice of women on the boards and it helped a lot with ses the lst time it was like getting the flu elevated temp and ached all over the chemo i am doing now halaven has not been a bad one at all i have really thin hair but hanging in there and i think it has stopped coming out constipation but i have that with most chemo and slight neuropathy the reason i think it is working is because my ca really jumped up but i will know more after i get scan results next week one good thing is that there are a lot of chemos out there i had my first weekly taxol this morning so far so good complain about anything other than being tired from the benedryl they gave me i usually pass out with 20 mg they gave me 50 so i expect to be out cold from that they gave me iv benedryl steroid and pepcid nothing for nausea because they said most people need it but if i do start to feel it i should take my compazine trying not to take anything because the meds are probably the reason for my headaches that come and go i will keep you all posted during the week with from this but remember i also got herceptin and perjeta with the taxol so if i do feel se it could be from the other meds leslie i keep ice chips in my mouth as tolerated during taxotere and 15 min before and after the first round i very dedicated and got a few mouth sores ouch the second round i was much more motivated about the ice chips and never had any mouth sores after that i also did not have any taste changes i do wonder about the change in taste i never had issues with that although i did lose my appetite due to nausea severe reflux your olfactory taste sensation nerves are of course in your mouth so why sucking on ice keep the chemo from going there like the caps do for your scalp too and thus preserve your sense of taste it obviously keeps it from causing mouth sores by the same means but i know hortense and many other sucked on ice chips yet still had taste changes so i know i always thought i avoided it b c of the ice chips i may have just been lucky genetically that this was one chemo symptoms i did not have to deal with i was dg with breast ca in at age 35 tx with ac x 4 cycles and taxol x 4 followed by radiation developped lymphedema almost immediately and was treated with manual le tx x 3 months with moderate response wore a sleeve and glove since and did massage but slowly worsened until 10 mo ago started developping a frozen shoulder at that time and started physical therapy after 3mo of pt underwent a mobilization under anesthesia which was only semisuccessful at best was diagonsed with recurrence in a femur and low back and was treated with radiation tx and feel fine in those was all ok for the shoulder and arm continued pt for mo but range of motion has remained poor and the pain just gets got into manual le and reid sleeve therapy againand was told that my arm is 5 bigger this time than 4 years ago in addition i have lost most of the use of my arm and hand i am seeing a pain specialist no who has gotten my pain under better control with meds and trigger point injections my pain seem to be related to my cancer and i am responding well to the new tx is there anything else i can do for the lymphedema which has only come down 1 in 2 months of tx or the frozen shoulder my orthopedist want to do anything more for fear of complications related to the lymphedema hi i am sure some of you remember geeta 75 she was a really good friend of shelliks geeta is not doing well she has fluid in her lungs and doctor do not think that there is anything that can be done at this time but try to keep her comfortable she is currently in the hospital i saw her about a month ago she was just finishing up wbr for brain mets that had been found recently along with liver mets she also was starting on abraxane she was very tired and was having trouble seeing assumed se from the wbr she started to slowlyrecover and even started posting on facebook when the lungs started filling with fluid at first they did not know what was causing it and had to rule out heart problems at this moment i am waiting to find out if it is the lungmets she has had for quite a while that is all the info i have right now i will keep everyone posted if possible i have so much i want to say about geeta but just cant right now if anyone wants to pm me feel free lorene i have been wearing compression stockings sometimes during the day my med onc wrote me a prescription for them because the tamoxif ck was causing my normally beautiful and thin ankles to swell like old lady cankles my legs always felt really good on the days i wore them so i bought a pair of compression running socks and i really like them i have not done any long distances with them yet getting to be winter running season and i really gotten myself mentally prepared for the cold yet but i am hopeful that they will help with the cramping oh and a synposis of the things i have tried for cramping most of which have a sound medical basis melanie at my first diagnosis i did four rounds of taxotere after four rounds of ac so i was bald when starting the taxotere and already feeling like crap the taxotere caused my finger and toe nails to fall off and i had sinus headaches a lot while getting it maybe vacation first chemo after is a good idea i never puked with any of the chemo so i add anything on the nausea issue talk to your onc about your plans for the month as he she may have some good ideas too whatever you decide let it kick cancer butt jean istreet i am so sorry your experience where less than great i have to said that after 5hrs yesterday i was also almost given up as well but then a woman came today complaining about how horrible is to wear a wig itchy she developed rash infection and sarna because of the extreme heat and the one wearing a scarf complained because she felt her pillow was liketrying to sleep on top of a pork spin well i guess each one select her on ways to make this healing journey more interesting in the process laura as you will see on my pictures gel bands have help me a lot to keep so far the hair in my back and my sides definitely for my 4th and last ac i am taking aleve 2 hrs earlier ativan 1 hr before and iv ativan here are some of my pictures today after 3 dd ac red devil this make me forgot pain and torture like when you see the baby after give birth you remember how painful it was but suddenly it was not that bad wonder why my husband and my on where doing the happy dance becausei have only one ac to go i start to believe this is a reeeeeeeally strong treatment i keep thinking but i still have 12 taxol to go it did not matter for them i amalmostdone pinguin confused that said these is how much i have been shedding after 2nd ac but i focus on the hair on my head not on the one in my bags linda my chemo was taxotere family of taxol and cytoxan i had bone pain and muscle pain from that big time and that was really compounded by the neulasta injection the next day the first injection of nuelasta almost did me in 5 days later my oncologist mess around with advil etc he gave me an rx for vicodin that worked he said there is absolutely no sense in having pain and i agree that also helps with sleeping which i had a great problem with and still am i had my last thankfully chemo two weeks ago and am still experienceing big time fatigue will start radiation sometime in september i hope you feel better nancy maryjc yup the runny nose is definitely herceptin herceptin can cause heart problems so glad getting an echo i think herceptin heart problems resolve once the drug is finished the chemo drug that can cause permanent heart problems is adriamycin the red devil it sounds like you were getting taxotere since a neuropathy culprit when you get a chance go to my profile and add some of your details so understand better been a loooooong time since posted on the boards hoping you all can ease my worry about being told its ok to stop my tamoxifen after 7 years and not take an aromatase in its place onco says he is concerned about my weight gain over the past year 12 pounds blood work has been perfect for years no issues i know each case is different anyone else stopped their meds completely tia dawn this is more information from very early pages it will help those who discovered the thread later on and i have found it a good refresher and interesting to read earlier posts i have found a bit more information about the group of chemotherapy drugs known as heavy metals or platins the particular one mentioned is cisplatin the brand name of which is platinol it belongs to the same group as carboplatin brand name paraplatin and oxaliplatin investigations about platins showed that platinum a heavy metal inhibited cell division in a powerful way and was an excellent drug apparently it is very effective and can be used in high doses with moderate toxicity according to my merck medical book these platins seem to have some of the same side effects as the group of chemotherapy drugs to which cyclophosphamide brand name cytoxan belongs for example they suppress the immune system and the bone marrow i am a bit confused about what happens with hair merck states that carboplatin causes hair loss if i were you and your oncologist is suggesting carboplatin i would ask for a complete list of all the possible side effects i would also ask whether you would have carboplatin alone or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs you might find the following link i hope this helps since we got on to the topic of food and nutrition in some posts i thought i would post a list of what are said to be foods i found this in a book entitled anti cancer a new way of life by dr david recommended foods green tea olives and olive oil turmeric and curry ginger cruciform vegetables brussels sprouts cabbage cauliflower broccoli and bok choi garlic onions leeks shallots chives vegetables and fruit rich in carotenoids carrots yams sweet potatoes squash pumpkin tomatoes persimmons apricots beetroot and all the bright coloured fruit and vegetables tomatoes and tomato sauce soy there is a piece of advice stating not to eat soy based foods during chemotherapy with taxol because apparently the genistein in soy can interfere with taxol stop several days before and start several days after treatment confirmation of this interaction from human studies is awaited mushrooms herbs and spices seaweed berries plums peaches and nectarines citrus fruit pomegranate juice red wine rich in resveratrol i do not drink any alcohol and get my resveratrol from black and red grapes dark chocolate more than 70 cocoa i buy 90 cocoa vitamin d omega 3 oily fish and flaxseed probiotics i eat soy yoghurt foods rich in selenium i eat brazil nuts and some seafood for this i hope you find this useful the book is very interesting and gives details of how these foods help to fight cancer by stopping angiogenesis or bringing about apoptosis the death of cancer cells do any of you read books about breast cancer nutrition etc sylvia as many others have mentioned it really is a personal decision i thought about it long and hard myself at first being totally opposed to the idea of taking lots of research speaking to several doctors and people taking it i finallly decided to give it a try side effects have been minimal and at worst come and go sometimes i feel something and wonder if the tamoxifen then it goes away really no different than the other aches and pains been feeling as i get later into my 40s like kareylou my pms has actually gotten much better i do feel more evened out and that week before feel half as bad as it used to still getting regular periods and as someone who has suffered from migraines for almost 30 years they are actually getting less frequent not to say that i am happy about taking a drug like this every day and i do worry about the less noticeable side effects but for now it seems like the best option and i also do everything possible in a more natural way also but do not feel that one option precludes the other hey ladies i havent heard the results back from my doctor yet hopefully i hear from hear from him tomorrow this is day 5 for me on my first round of taxol and i am experiencing alot of bone joint pain vicodin is my friend although i have to watch out for the constipation i havent been doing too much just taking it easy i need to call cleaning for a reason program so they can clean my house this month i am so thankful for that program it is very nice for the employees to donate their time to help us the cancer patients because who wants to worry about cleaning up when you dont have the energy to even get out of bed wow so much has been said since i was last on monday morning yesterday morning we had a snow storm and no satelite so no puter then i had to go for a well women doctor appt this morning we are leaving for califonia to go see the grandkids so much i would like to comment on but have time to do so i will tell you deb i told fiancee darrell about your comment in regards to the chair needing to be sugically removed from my arse i repeat his words other than the fact that he said i needed to get my scranny arse to work we tease and joke alot he even calls me scarecrow due to my chemo brain someone else mentioned the fact about no supplements during chemo i took tons of them i was taking 25 pills a day at one point gheesh i wish things so contradicting in all this cancer treatment i guess we just have to trust what we are told and our gut instinct as for taxol vs ac the taxol was easier for me yes it is longer and the only side affect i had was the bone pain in the legs but they told me that was from the nuelasta but i get it with the ac gifts are wonderful and i received some very nice ones some from people i even know glad you got the hats deb hot flashes my little bubble pack of arimidex i got has a little club or whatever to sign up for they send you some little gifts remember what all except for a little battery operated mist fan that was the only thing i wanted got it yet tho i do have a little fan i keep next to my bed it helps alot well i better remove my arse from this chair and go get my shower we will be stopping in laughlin for the nite cha ching then off to cally thursday morning hope all of you wonderful ladies have a great day my big big hugs to everyone god bless us alllori hello all well i so lucky this time around with my scans and i am now onto adriamyacin getting my heart scan tomorrow and will start friday taxol was my favorite tx ever even more than the hormonals except for losing the hair part for some reason i had a good cry over this one been 5 years and i guess i just needed a woe is me moment on some facebook pages for metastatic breast cancer and sometimes i feel like the only one who or never been ned time to take a break from social media and get my head on straight again good luck to all of you i really hope for all of you to continue on taxol for a long long long time laura chrisrenee 77 thinking about you while youre in surgeryhalfcan youve probably heard all the horror stories about taxotere so id like to add that my first cycle was the worst plus i had to travel for my daughters softball tournament a few days after and the second was pretty bad but the last two were a breeze so dont be too discouraged if youre having a tough time this week im now a couple months out and other than some stiffness in my legs i feel completely glad you had a good day yesterday heres to more good days fewer bad days _ann_ i had an mri halfway through chemo and the tumor was gone then another mri after chemo and it was still gone so i was trying not to get into a headspace where i expected the pcr but it was hard good wishes for you how many more cycles for you how are you feeling on the taxol cowpower im into my rads now too today will be and im now officially bored with them its a 25 minute drive each way and the time is different every day what a pain in the butt of course this whole cancer thing is a big inconvenience juneaubugg ow ow ow a real tattoo would hurt so much on your head i just had a henna tattoo done my daughter graduated from high school in june and i didnt have a hat or scarf to go with my pretty dress i only own one and i never did bother buying a wig since i wasnt working but the henna tattoo was cool ive actually been considering shaving my head and doing it again since the hair is so sparse and uneven right now but its getting too cold to be completely bald by im only on herceptin right now and the only side effect is mild symptoms for a few days its such a nice change after chemo doxielover great news and im sure youll feel even better when you get the treatment plan in place i think then you feel less my news for today is that i had bedhead twice this week my hair actually is growing the things that make you happy when youve been dealing with cancerbig happy hugs to everyone sue i imagine doing more chemo after surgery after 6 rounds of tchp my body was really in lousy shape i could barely go up the stairs for 5 weeks post chemo it was likely compounded by the zoladex shot i got before round 5 make sure to take a good probiotic supplement during treatment start a few days after each infusion and stop when the drugs are most active in your system the chemo drugs are toxic to your gut flora and you need that to help your body assimilate nutrients definitely ice hands and feet as some other gals in my chemo group had some terrible issues with their nails someone i know was hospitalized on tchp due to diarrhea electrolyte issues twice her team switched out weekly taxol for the every three weeks taxotere and that seemed to be enough adjustment i am 6 months pfc tomorrow my ears still ring my energy is low radiation slowed me way down my period came back a few weeks ago but it was really heavy and my anemia has returned after it had gone away a couple months ago rads probably contributed some in this regard my hair regrowth is about 3 long and my eyebrows are still filling in it takes a while for eyebrow shed to not be all at once so they get thinning in waves and then come back more my achilles tendons are still tight this started a couple months post chemo and read it can happen due to low potassium levels exactly what taxols due push potassium out of your body looking forward to being done with herceptin in just over two months best wishes to everyone you can do this a so sorry to hear the fatigue has lingered peggy my mo has approved me taking vit b during taxol this can help with fatigue and neuropathy maybe worth asking your mo if you already i have my first taxol on friday and am not looking forward to it also starting herceptin at the same time jenn i checked in for a while but i have been reading your updates as they come along good to catch up a little on all of the news husker good for you making some tough decisions it looks like they are already proving to be good ones i wish you a happy mdg and colodisneylover it sounds like you are both well on the mend glad to hear it mdg i think a trip to italy for your ten years is mandatory divine what can i say great news great summer i am so happy to hear these alaska is definitely on my list but australia certainly tops the list and lily i hope life is treating you well penny it sounds like many of us stilts fluff mdg me want to come to australia out under the stars far from civilization sounds like absolute paradise to me hopefully someday and look you up as a tour guide i am doing pretty well my kids will be out of school next week and i am trying to find enough things to keep them occupied i have been struggling with anxiety lately which is likely the result of tamoxifen plus my zoladex injections my mo gave me a scrip for effexor for hot flashes but i had a most unpleasant se of numbness ahem down under not acceptable to me so i stopped taking it after only a few days after a few crying jags today and serious anxiety over the last 24 hours i guess i should get myself to someone who can try something else on me i am so conflicted because i have never liked the idea of chasing ses from medicine with another medicine i know this can be a private subject but if anyone has any thoughts or advice i would really appreciate it ladies i hope you are all planning on a wonderful summer or winter penny it is great to hear of all the adventures you are experiencing i did very well with dd ac started it last yr 2007 what kept be healthy during all the ac txs was the neulasta shot that u get the next day after each ac tx i find the acbothering me much until after 3 and 4 i was a tad more fatigued never had any real issues with nauseau but would highly recommend u stay on top of the meds they give u after my first ac tx heck that nite i went to a hs basketball game everyone is different and other then this bc i was healthy otherwise it was the dd taxol that really pulled me down at the end with extreme fatigue with all of this i was fortunate that i really have an outside job i do make candy bqts out of my home and retail at 2 locations and i was able to continue this level of work during my chemo txs a year later im doing great sure there are days that i get exhausted easily but as i continue to exercise thishelps it alot more energy i would say to my onclogist np heck i could be poster child for the chemo ac hugs andprayers you will do fine too it is doable my mom is on her 3rd cycle of tykerb and frankly she has about had it the nausea and heartburn and belching all the time is getting her down she has tried every antacid on the market nothing is working she was on 1250mg of tykerb and 3 xeloda in the am and 3 at night she is tired of taking pills she is beginning to get cracks in her heals and is using tea tree oil to try to keep her skin moist the nausea and heartburn is what is getting her down because there is nothing worse than feeling sick to your stomach every day she is on the tyrkerb 3 weeks on one week off and they recently changed her xeloda from 2 weeks on one week off to one week on and one week off she started the new combo today and after just getting better from her 2 weeks break from both she is back to having heartburn and nausea again i wish i knew what to do to help her the antacids are not working at all mom suffers with acid reflux really badly my mom was on taxol and herceptin and did not have a single side effect so she feels like she is back on the nightmarish ac that she had way back 6 years ago so i am thinking they need to change the dose of tykerb she just got through grewling whole brain radiation so she is not a happy camper at all right now and is getting quite tired of treatment right now i been on for a while but having hada rough few weeks i know this is the place to come i read with interest about the arm problems i have the same symptoms but not on the surgery side soi am worried i cannot move my arm backwards or use it for very much at alland cannot sleep on it at all the pain is in my shoulder and down the arm i had an x ray which came back normal the doc saidi can have physio as it may be atorn rotator cuff due to exercise or a frozen shoulder but of coursei fear the worst as i read about someone who ignored shoulder pain and it was secondaries on her lung i am on tamoxifen and herceptin and all major joints ache i feel like an old woman and cannot shift the excess weight i have put on my hot flashes are keeping me awake at night along with the joint pain i feel likei have flu after each herceptin and myright arm the one which aches is the one they use for the treatment and the veins are giving up i feel awful reading all of this backand of course i am so grateful to be here one year after diagnosis buti am also finding that now time has passed many just assume all is well and really want to hear my moans i just know that someone on here will recognise these feelings howdy i did 4 ac4 taxoland taxol was a lot harder for mei too am olderstill have some neuropathybut this does not happen to everyonesending you lots of hugsand very best take good care sierra hi ladiesin the hospital for hydration so have some alone computer time paulette so glad to hear from you lots of thoughts and prayers have passed by this board for you in your absence so know that there is plenty of people who care for you quirkygirl and pamalmada and other moms out there as a women with no children it has crossed my mind many times how difficult it must be to deal with the fears and needs of children while going through this i seriously know how you are doing it but am mighty impressed with the love and committment shown by the mothers of this board to do what they can for there families while in a pile of crap themselves you are all endlessly amazing to me coming from a girl who can hardly manage walking my dog on a daily basis pat i too have a big boob so i get the indignity amazon the drugs for the se for taxotere caused me some depression too the steroids are very strong and pain killers are just as bad stay hydrated as best you can as it will help with everything i told my dh that i am exempt from any repercussion of moods i did snap out of it about day 18 of my first taxotere round fyitonilee i know when i post my concerns and fears and vent to this board women hear me and they understand i feel that gap i do with the rest of the world it can be so lonely when you are with people and they just understand this and it is doubly hard on our spouses cause they are our primary support know that if you need people to really empathize we are hear for you ellen i have heard that rads catch up with you and can go on well after your done amazing that you are managing working and i am sooooo jealous of your hair you look great northwinds i hope your feeling better soon your weather might just be worse than our east coast snow i was trapped for two days as the snow plows get up our street i finally waded out thank goodness for good winter clothes veronica when did you go on tamoxifen in a sweating mess without it so am wondering how much worse it can be welcome to new people a great bunch of ladies here have a good and warm night ladiesjab this has been a thread the medical providers definitely prepare you for what lies ahead for sure the are downplayed and sometimes not even mentioned as a possibility to them all about longevity to hell with quality of life my oncologist is definitely a quantity not quality kind of guy i think he gets a big ego boost keeping people alive as long as possible even if you end up in a nursing home as a result of it seem to dawn on him that not everyone wants to live if it means giving up everything to do so i was stage iv from the i did 6 a c followed by 6 taxol herceptin he initially wanted me to to 8 a c but it would have pushed me over the safe limit so i said no he wanted to do 8 taxol but i stopped at 6 because i want to worsen the neuropathy i had a mastectomy through the chemo i actually did start to get some neuropathy in my hands when i did the a c when i finished the chemo i was ned and was in remission for a year until scans in march showed a new area in my hip been doing navelbine with herceptin along with zometa since march the navelbine is making the neuropathy get worse my onc when questioned said that navelbine very rarely causes neuropathy i have any pain but i just keep getting a little number and my onc is aware of this yet when discussing future chemo options he said he wants to use abraxane i guess he really wants to see me end up in a wheelchair in a nursing home to him this would be a viable option but not for me i just think they get how much the impact our life to the point that far worse then the disease has ever been none of my bone mets have ever bothered me at all initially my liver was full of mets but i had no symptoms at all still no sign of them so the herceptin seems to be keeping them at bay been very fortunate that my qol has been overall very good however like some of the others beginning to have some issues with my feet i have to be careful walking on uneven ground and watch where stepping as be very easy to trip and fall my hands have actually been more problematic then my feet or maybe i just notice it more picking up small objects and gripping can be difficult i can still do my needlework and beading but it aggravates the neuropathy so i have to do it sparingly sometimes writing is a bit difficult hey it does feel good to rant about it it this disease certainly tests our strength and fortitude it hi juannelle so sorry that still struggling after your accident the and some other medications that they give us do stop us from healing be careful and watch for any on faslodex and the first day i have bone pain and joint pain then nothing else but we know if it is helping at all i asked the doctors how long do they think i have and they said that is all the different medications on now slow the process then about a year or so however with my fight they say maybe a little longer i had a set back this week i thought i had an allergic reaction to something and i usually run to the doctors i take prednisone benadryl and wait it out well this time my arm got really swollen and it was the so i let my daughters convince me to go to the emergency room they kept me in the hospital for seven days what came from it all is that i had a full out lupus attack even know i had lupus i was always told that i tested negative this time they did blood skin and muscles biopsies and lupus so on top of being stage iv now fighting from the lupus i just wonder if a girl can get a break in life sometime here is an early happy easter to all of you out there and i hope you are all spending wonderful days and time with family and friends hello not doing too good here had first tax a week ago and herceptin 5 days ago called my team yesterday as really having awful stomach cramps and bloating as soon as i eat or drink they seemed to think it was constipation however have had the trots all night and still cramping like labour pains sound like constipation to me any tips or suggestions be feeling a bit better by now kt you keep that bracelet and enjoy wearing it good for you been known to go out shopping for a gift and return with one for myself kiwi 1966 i was switched from tamoxifen to zoladex aromasin last october like you i had heavy node involvement and an angry tumor as my surgeon likes to call it noticed an increase in joint aches and weight gain grrr apart from that tolerated it ok before i switched i had a bone density scan to get a baseline aromasin can accelerate bone density loss i also take risedronate weekly as my baseline great i hope your mri goes well alyson good luck house buying kiwicatmom weird why would he ask you that be interested to know how it goes for you on toremifene getting the cyp 2d6 test to see if i need it i have the most awful dry mouth on tamoxifen so quite like to find out if i have that on toremifene or not i hope it goes well for you and you have side effects i am back at work today after my 4th taxol treatment and i feel fine i had to get the dr to give me some sleeping pills so i wouldnt be up all night and it turned out good i am trying to let the news of my negative brca gene test settle in there are good things about not having it and bad things i guess i am so greatful that i found this website so i can talk to all of you wonderful women about what going through and read that you all are going through the exact same thing citykitty i am suprised that my hair hasnt fallen out more by now too i started taxol weekly x12 on jan 7 i dont do the herceptin so maybe that is the difference it started thinning on day 19 i noticed alot more in the shower and when i straightened it yesterday i probably shoud retire the straightener for awhile but i cant bear to part with it i am sporting a shorter haircut i wish i had the nerve to buzz cut it but i cant even do a pixie i love the way hair looks but i dont think i could do it right now i admire you for still running i wish i was a runner i hate to exercise but now with the cancer i dont have an option marymeg i have ordered a pretty wig that my hairdresser is going to cut for me when i have her shave my hair and i also have some scarves i think i will eventually use the scarves or hats i hear the wigs can be a pain do you live near no or did you go there to have your surgery i live a short distance from there and love the city we go to mardi gras every year but gonna have to sit this one out next year the big easy better watch out i guess i need to find someone tat had mouth sores on ac and hopefully get them with taxol my mo seems to think that i have a problem with them then i almost had to delay my 2nd ac because the sores were so severe they are that bad again with round 3 thankfully i have an extra 5 days to heal because of thanksgiving sorry to hear about the progression i have been on weekly abraxane avastin on thursdays for the past 6 months started weekly then switched to the 3 weeks on 1 week off routine they were able to flex the schedule for trips and whatever was going on in my life similar to redwoman it has worked great my onc talked about me staying on for a year or more but my cancer has been knocked back enough that i can transition to femara soon so i think it all depends on how things look i started losing my hair about 3 4 weeks in remember exactly but it was coming out in handfuls so dh shaved it off the funny thing is my hair started to grow back after about 4 months so now i have a little bit of fuzzy hair on my head but no eyebrows lashes a vision of loveliness the runny bloody nose thing is annoying esp in the morning i have fatigue joint pain in my knees hips neuropathy in hands and toes in my case the neuropathy sorta leveled out after a couple months and it all that bad but maybe lucky constipation is a pain in the so i take stool softeners every day and have a tube of prep h in my bathroom blood counts have been i have gcsf shot or two every week depending on my counts good luck love your avatar btw should take about 6 weeks for it to completely clear out of your system i stopped it temporarily a couple of years ago for 6 weeks and definitely saw a reduction in hot flashes increase in libido and less joint pain tamoxifen is known in some women to cause mood problems good luck to you glad you had a decent go around taxotere is famous for making one tired it is a very strong drug taxotere fried my vien so it is good news that you got a port rest a lot if and the fatigue gets to be too much let your doctor know janis i have my last taxol on wednesday a few days ago i noticed some new eyebrow hairs growing also i never lost all of my hair my scalp has been about 30 stubble ever since i took the road to bald in may now a lot of hair has sprouted which is about long and yeah it looks ridiculous having some hair left on the head while on a c t does not mean the chemo work very well right right right someone tell me the chemo prob worked even though i still have some hair left slap excuse me please pardon the anyway there are some little eyebrow hairs that there a week ago hello all interesting to read all your experiences thanks so much for sharing i am married 18 happy years with two boys 9 and 11 i was diagnosed oct 2009 at age 41 i was undergoing a physical mammos and ultrasounds had come back clear blood work showed elevated which doc suspected heart disease he did a heart scan which came back clear but showed enlarged node in right axilla turns out that blood marker is also a cancer marker no palpable breast mass and more mammo us and mri still showed nothing in breasts biopsy of axilla showed adenocarcinoma likely of breast origin axillary node dissection dec 09 nodes positive cts showed several enlarged nodes throughout including both right and left clavicle liver and groin biopsy showed lymphovascular invasion extranodal extension staged at 3c still no evidence of primary called occult primary therefore diagnose as idc or ilc nor can they officially grade it has gone to tumor board to determine treatment plan as am told this is very rare grey area highly unusual bla bla bla if got those odds hello lottery brca negative no known family history began chemo jan 2010 3 fec and 3 taxotere was original plan but severe gi side effects from fec landed me in hospital after 2nd so switched to ec only for third then 12 weekly taxol which has been easier on my gi tract i have previous ulcerative colitis and have no bowel but have a jpouch so chemo did a number on me i am almost done taxol 2 more go go and been too too bad neuropathy biggest issue doc just lowered dose to 80 last week which has helped struggled with mast decision currentplan although i change my mind almost daily is unimast in august followed by 35 rads then hopefully diep reconstruction next spring i have lurked on these boards since m diagnosis and has been very helpful just starting to post in the last few weeks oh and my hair is growing back yucky grey black baby hair but at least its growing back for any of you facing radiation after your taxol i justi found this on another site and thought it was worth sharing here written by an oncologist talk amonst yourselves radiation wounds are not really burns and they are not rated by degree medical professional who are trained in radiation usage will generally not use degrees to rate the wounds instead they will use grades from the internationally accepted ctc common toxicity criteria that is used by all major cancer research organizations that is why it is call common the reason you use degrees is that burns start at the top and spread downward and the degree of the burn has to do with how far through the skin thickness it caused damage that at all what happens with radiation therefore the degree system very useful with regard to some of the advice in this thread all i can say it that it is well intended but perhaps not exactly accurate i do not in any way discourage patients from forming communities and sharing information but sadly that information is sometimes not accurate although we stop people from passing around bad information we physicians can minimize that aspect of cancer care by slowly and patiently explaining what we are doing to your body and why and of course what you should expect as side effects as a radiation oncologist my consults generally go well over an hour with an additional 15 minutes once a week during therapy and 20 minutes at each follow up so for even the most routine case which are never routine to the patient i will spend several hours over the course of three months sharing information explaining listening and responding to concerns i am not a saint i am paid to do that the problem is not that physicians are lazy or greedy some are but instead perhaps the problem is that physicians often do not understand that their job is more than the performing of the service their job is also the teaching comforting and true healing of the patient i do not think that the accurate and safe delivery of radiation is good enough it is only a small part of the job and if you going to do the whole job send the patient to someone who will i think i apply radiation with any more skill than other doctors but perhaps i spend a little more time helping my patients understand and prepare for what i am recommending with that in mind please allow me to share a little bit of general information about radiation wounds although i cannot address your case specifically having never examined you there is zero build up of radiation in a patient from external beam radiation therapy although there is from free isotope therapy or seed implantation but those are very different none it does not happen so you need to clear any residual radiation out because there any i am not out to insult anyone but to suggest that there is residual radiation following external beam radiotherapy is just plain incorrect radiation wounds are not damaged skin per se as much as they are missing skin let me explain radiation causes skin to fail to reproduce properly and thus as you use up your normal skin like we all do all day there are no new layers of skin coming up from the bottom so eventually the area can ulcerate this might look like a thermal burn but it has very little in common with a thermal burn and the treatments for thermal burns will not help much let me be clear many skin reactions need nor will they find benefit from a 100 dollars worth of potions and lotions from the herbal medicine shop you expect me to say that because a doctor perhaps some will stop listening to me now because i think that a plant from the middle of the jungle ground up and slathered on your skin will fix the problem why would it but allow me to also say most skin reactions need nor will they benefit from 100 dollars worth of laboratory chemicals stuffed into a brand name prescription from the pharmacy neither approach will help heal the skin very much and neither will prevent the damage in the first place do i believe in natural cures you bet your body in its natural amazing way can regenerate skin without lotions or potions or pills most of the time very few radiation reactions need serious supportive care most not all will just get better of course there are some severe wounds that will require medical attention but without an understanding of what is wrong no one be they md do nd or shaman can be expected to properly assist you if your medical professional is using terms like second degree to describe a radiation wound then there is a good chance although i say for sure that they are not trained in any of the more than 100 years of science and knowledge that can help you in this situation now keep in mind i said herbal potions and laboratory chemicals heal the wound much faster i say they sooth the area and ease your suffering while your body repaired the damage that they are very good at for a grade i skin reaction a good containing aloe is about as good as anything that costs a hundred times of much in my opinion i would rather a patient use aloe but there are also some lidocaine containing topical medications that are helpful if they insist colloidal silver a very natural medication for the record despite being sold at the pharmacy can inhibit the growth of bacteria although it may not cure an active infection infection in general is actually not that common in radiation wounds but it can happen and should be treated when it does rarely radiation wounds do need more assertive supportive care truly very sorry that you had to experience such a situation keep in mind you have to clear or remove dead skin from a radiation wound like you might from a thermal burn at least not aggressively the problem is missing skin not damaged skin or at least that is the more logical way to model the situation missing skin be healed with an herb or a medication and missing skin sure as heck be scrubbed at until it missing anymore missing skin for the most part needs to wait until the body grows more skin that can take weeks for very mild reactions to several months for serious radiation injuries make sure your medical professional has training and certification in these issues keep in close contact with them and ask them in no uncertain terms for a timeline that you can use in your healing expectations then if your body does not respond on that timeline ask them why ask them if something is wrong ask and then ask and then ask some more until your doctor explains what is going on with your body to your satisfaction you have that right and you also have that responsibility very few physicians and far fewer patients are qualified to give advice on radiation wounds find support and comfort on the internet but find advice on the cause and cure for radiation damage to human tissues by consulting a board certified radiation oncologist one that cares about your case and takes the time to explain things to you god bless you and good luck there is no one size fits all when it comes to txs we are each so unique and have different reactions for me 4 dd a c was not bad at all it did not slow me down at all i did lose head hair and about of all other hair lost sense of taste nothing tasted bad just no taste at all and sense of smell also lost all appetite hubby had to call me several times a day to remind me to eat something a waterholic always having ice water within reach so habit took over and water was never a problem never any nausea or pain issues the 12 weekly taxol was another story i was completely and utterly exhausted the entire time i basically existed either in bed or on the couch in front of tv the exhaustion rapidly left starting a week after last infusion even though i started rads a week after last taxol the rest of all body hair left taste smell and appetite stayed gone my temperature dropped drastically ran between 94 96f so i was always cold for infusions i had to have one of the glasses in cubicles with own thermostat with a bed instead of a recliner and lots of warmed blankets i slept through all my taxols as soon as they would start the iv benadryl go nighty night waking up as abruptly 15 minutes before end way through taxol i started having problems with keeping my k potassium levels up close to normal so went on mega doses of k still have to take k to keep it up zn and mg stay good i did not have any pain or nausea i even quit taking the at home anti nausea meds with no problems i was told that rather or not you had issues with morning sickness could indicated issues with chemo nausea i had absolutely no morning sickness with either son and nonenat all with either chemos 5 years since i was on taxol i know all about the hand foot syndrome mine is from doxil and it hurts to walk i am also still working and typing and writing is very painful but you do what you gotta do i was told recently about amerigel i soak my hands in epson salt and then dry thourghly and apply the amerigel

knot over it but decided i worry about it it is what it is day you have so much hair already i was surprised by the salt pepper look but i guess going back to blonde golfergirl beth a little late with this but congratulations on finishing rads how are you feeling do you have any drug therapy starting up lauram you started rads yesterday hope going ok how many will you have latte i had my surgery first opted for because i wanted to increase the odds of beating this just imagine having to go through it again some risks of radiation include lung scarring heart issues my bad breast was on the l side rad burns lymphedema had node involvement so being radiated too so be really concerned about radiating the good one just my 2 cents leanna with you on the nails see my comments to magda the neuropathy what a pain on the bright side i agree with denise your posts about chemo brain made me laugh not funny is the state of our health care system and the monthly premiums i pay for myself my husband and my paralegal are obscene what really grates on my last nerve about this is the huge surpluses the health insurance companies have stocked away while raising premiums every year ok as my dorothy god rest her soul would have said oy enough already libraryjenn i know anything about lupron but i hope it helps sure a big comfort that your little one enjoys the sitter so much hope the cold wear you out magda i hope you have minimal ses from the zoladex do you get that after each chemo tx i thought dodged the taxol nail issues because i kept them polished all through treatment however 2 weeks ago i lost of my l thumb nail and now all but 2 nails have varying levels of white striated areas at the tips looks sort of like a bad french manicure njbhwgirl welcome back i can imagine how frustrating and it is to be waiting for answers not getting clear ones however your onc seems satisfied that no cause for alarm so try to relax until the next round of tests the advice i just gave myself this weekend really sorry i join you for this but would love to next year packjen jenn what a wonderful trip planned my sister was in hawaii many years ago still talks about how beautiful it was right you deserve it patricia a baby grand is just the thing to say f cancer do you play i took lessons for 4 years in grade school but abandoned it for the guitar when i reached high school funny story about motivation on the first day of school all students attended mass sat with their teachers first grade in the first row and so on when my girlfriends i saw the new young male 6th grade teacher we about swooned in our pew he was gorgeous the next week he organized students to play guitar and sing at the weekly folk masses really dating myself now although i could sing actually been singing in church for years i desperately wanted to play the guitar with him so i learned enough cords to get by the auditions once i started i really enjoyed it and improved a great deal under his tutelage musical that is sacphotomom denise love to see brandy wait until you feel less tired just do what i makeup all smoke mirrors summer theresa get some rest and get over your cold soon daiva manis and peds with emma how lovely sure you enjoyed every minute of being with her loved your chemo brain stories fret about not recovering as fast as you thought from the last tx i think normal especially when you consider how much toxic stuff was poured into you over the last few months feel better soon hugs to everyone so i had an appointment to have chemo gemzar yesterday it would have been my third but my platelets were too low and with my symptoms and tumor marker over so we are switching to abraxane this week i had progression with the last chemo too so we are moving from this one quickly having an mri on tuesday because my pain is in an area that could affect the spinal column if there is something there i will need radiation to prevent paralysis i also found a lump on the back of my skull that the onc says is a met i left the appointment oddly calm talked to my family like it was nothing kept saying it is out of my control so why should i fret over something i do anything about have i gone slap dab crazy i think i should be freaking about now not on any new drug so why am i so calm has anyone else ever been like this surely i will have scanxiety with the mri i feel like cybil with one calm personality and one crazed personality hi yall two issues complete hair loss vs thinning i had complete hair loss on abraxane as it started to grow again it was very white curly and fine eventually more color came out of the roots so i trimmed off the hair it continued to change until i had a pretty normal head of hair that i could easily style now with halaven it started to fall out in small clumps but i still have hair everywhere on my head the texture and color are pretty limp and i wear a scarf frequently a wig to go out to nice events i look really strange anyway with the swollen runny eyes from rads i guess i look sick and makeup wont stay on its like painting an tomato but my bod looks good now girls with weight loss and the old tummy tuck not bad i had the neulesta injections for my last 3 taxotere as i had ended up in hospital in quite a poorly way with a count of my onc did not want my last 3 tax or herceptin which i had started alongside the tax put on hold or delayed i am high risk of recurrence and her 1st ever patient to get approved funding for tax and herceptin on primary bc as this was 6 months before both were approved by nice my onc warned me it was an expensive jab hence why you had to ill to get it prescribed but it was cost effective against a 5 night stay in hospital its just the one jab that you can inject yourself 24 hours after chemo it has side effects pretty much the same as taxotere aches in the big bones as its making them work overtime to produce more bone marrow and wbc i had 4xfec 4xtaxotere 18 herceptin 25 rads and currently yrs on tamoxifen found the fec sickly but was over it in a matter of days but the taxotere is a sneeky one seemed to hit me differently each time but the tiredness did grow with each session would recommend the dark nail varnish diflam mouth wash plenty of neurofen and as much rest as possible however a plus point of the tax i feel sick or dizzy so stopped the anti sickness tablets and was able to help at my daughters dance shows and cheer my sons football good luck debbiex i am 44 years old and clinical stage ii invasive ductal carcinoma grade 3 i have had 12 taxol chemos without any complications but i am fixing to havemy third 21 cycle of fac and i suffer from severe nausea from the last two treatments i have lost about 7 pounds from being so ill this last treatment i am very frightened about this next round which is this monday because i am allergic to many of the nausea drugs and always end up in the er atleast twice duringthe three days of chemo i would feel more comfortable being in the hospital this next round of chemo how do i approach my doctor or do you have any suggestions log in to post a reply thanks i actually came on here a few days ago to post an update and then lost my post i was so fed i up and not feeling good so i gave up you are 2 treatments away from being done too right i hate this bone pain i think it lasted about 4 days last time starting on day 2 before it started to taper off the th day do you feel like taxol is better than ac overall i was never able to do anything more than going for a walk on ac but i have played tennis 3 times since my first taxol one of them with bone pain i thought maybe it would help verdict is no but it hurt more than it does when sitting doing nothing anyways not at the energy level i want to be but i play it by ear i hope to get into the swimming pool next week been a bit scared to because a public pool owned by my apartment complex and my counts were so low but since they were much higher and in normal range this week i feel a bit better about taking the plunge lol oh and i have to vent a little because it seems like everyone is making it hard for me to work part time there is more paperwork and i believe how many people are involved and require notes from my doctor on a regular basis i got paid by my work for my part time hours but they told me i need to use some vacation to supplement disability in order to keep benefits well they pay me out any vacation so i am stressing that my health insurance will be affected even though i filled out all the proper paperwork had trouble getting in touch with the person who is supposed to track my leave so had to make multiple phone calls and still gotten anywhere the state has been horrible about getting me my disability benefits for the days i work they claim they never received the latest paperwork from my doctor which is bs so i spent hours on the phone trying to get through to them on wednesday while i was on my way to chemo and again when i was in the chair i finally get through and the woman ends up hanging up on me prematurely i highly doubt ever experienced a major medical condition or she have treated me so terribly i received anything from them for about a month so now not getting anywhere close to what i should be getting so frustrated i know i should be thankful that i am able to get disability since some of you are still working full time but sometimes i feel it would be better less energy wasted to either be on full time leave which would eat up a good chunk of my vacation time or working full time this part time business causing all the problems ok vent over i knew you ladies would at least understand how frustrating it is when already feeling crappy from chemo toribethsmom welcome but sorry you have to be here too however you will find this is the best place for answering questions calming fears and all the support you could ever ask for as you can see by the numerous responses a wonderful group of ladies all in the same boat i was diagnosed in october with extensive bone mets pretty much my entire skeleton lit up on my pet scan my oncologist requested a pet due to shoulder pain loss of appetite and fatigue i honestly can say that the first 2 weeks were hell for me i had tumor flare from the tamoxifen reacted terribly to the pain medications and had severe flu like symptoms from my first zometa infusion however it has now been about months and i am feeling great no more bone pain good attitude little if any fatigue no other side effects and i even fell off my bike and fell hiking and break anything and my circulating tumor cell cound dropped from 46 bad to 2 great in just 2 months so there is hope i am finally seeing that now as for your questions i did ask 3 different oncologists your very question about the prognosis with widespread bone metastases vs only 1 or 2 lesions and they all responded that it make any difference at all that was from a local oncologist an oncologist at md anderson and also at methodist all in houston so hopefully that will put your mind at rest my treatments currently consist of tamoxifen lupron injections every 3 months and zometa monthly i now tolerate the zometa well with no side effects little side effects from the lupron and tamoxifen mild hot flashes vaginal dryness etc the typical menopausal stuff good luck to you keep in touch let me know if i can help in any way cat good afternoon everyone or at least after here gracie you asked a simple question or 2 going to provide you with an epistle of an answer so make sure you have a bit of uninterrupted time to read this a pet scan is like an ultrasound of sorts that is actually a fully body check to determine whether or not there are those beastly littlerogue cancer cells elsewhere in the body particularly with interest in the status of your bones it than that nasty chalky milk shake that you have to slowly drink before the scan then u r rolled into a tubular cylinder that is body length in order for the scan to do its thing u have to lay perfectly still i had to have both arms raised over my uncomfortable for about minutes then u r rolled out and on your way your medical team will evaluate results in order to speak w you about treatment plan may not be finalized until the results are determined the description given is they method used for there are others yes your onc should arrange for the pet scan and if not you have the right to ask why not also people with issues are typically required to undergo a muga or echocardiogram to evaluate their heart functions particularly if the ac t chemo regime is to be used you have the right to request that to be done regardless of whether or not had heart related issues in the past if you are on the adriamycin drug it has side effects that are associated with the onc should make the final assessment of your treatment plan and explain everything about it take someone with you when that is all discussed because you remember much of it they should take notes should tape record it if u still have questions you will you should definitely ask when you go to chemo class where you learn to be a good little chemo girl your onc should make that arrangement for you the nurse that provides the explanations about everything should speak w each individual about their specific treatment plan what to expect do not feel embarrassed about asking questions as soon as you are told what meds prescriptions will be offered to address nausea etc go to look up every one of them and become familiar with what they do any side effects especially if you have other meds that you are also taking not related to you find out your treatment plan do the same be given a bucket load of materials from your nurse dr you should read it laurie on this thread would tell you get a copy of time you make a visit for anything your treatment plan will depend on several factors based on the onc on dd ac t regime 8 weeks 4 rounds of adriamycin cytoxin every other week why called because it is every other week as opposed to a 3 week interval then i have 12 weekly doses of taxol with 6 weeks of radiation thereafter after each ac infusion a neulasta shot is given with 24 hours to boost the good cells count ward off infections you are unfamiliar with those drug terms go online to research at least know what they are just in case you are told that be treated with the same if not just come back here identify been recommended one of the much smarter more experienced ladies than me will fill you in i think judy is on this same regime but remember who else might be karen is right your radiologist onc should know exactly what will bethe most effective for you and imperative that you trust your medical your anxiety will escalate through the roof you want that learned so much for this group their support has been invaluable my questions are always answered based on their is exactly what i need i even start my treatments until wednesday so getting a little anxious again but i know i can get on this thread admit my ignorance by all the questions i ask they jump right in tell me what i might need to know if it is familiar to them great enough of my little tidbits everyone else has it down so they will be your wealth of info and resource deb jayney switched to femara at my request but only because i came across some research that suggested tamoxifen might not be beneficial in brca 1 carriers pauline posted this on the other thread but put it here too when i knew i was having my ovaries out i did a lot of research into tamoxifen vs ais and even though ais are superior to tamoxifen in women who have gone through the natural menopause they found that tamoxifen and ais had the same efficacy in women who had undergone a forced menopause so i guess you might as well stay on tamoxifen if it suits you although if the hot flushes really are unbearable it might be worth trying an ai hello all i started chemo in april but just found you last week thank you for sharing your lives and stories i feel close to you since we are all going through the same thing let me fill you in on where i am did the hard labor of dose dense ac and will be getting 7 of 12 weekly taxols tomorrow have been relatively fortunate with ses but am starting to see dark spots in some nails have had an assortment of minor but annoying skin problems since the ac blisters a rash peeling knees a painful sore skin just generally feels weird and injures easily been able to stay fairly positive throughout but this week i crashed i keep thinking okay tried this cancer thing for 4 months but i have to say that really not working out for me so i think just be moving along now it be nice if we could just walk away i am fortunate if you can call it that i had tram flap reconstruction so i have absolutely no stomach most women of my age do i lost a lost of weight on perjeta that even i was getting worried my onc assured me that the drug was working but that this was one of the side effrects of the drug for the majority of women just spent 6 months on abraxane with the usual steroids and gained some but not all of the weight back i know that the glucophage can cause constipation in some women but most women do lose weight i am one of the lucky ones if you can call it that i am thinking that the glucophage kept me from gaining too much weight on abraxane as far as constipation i did get something great from the holistic pharmacist which seems to have solved the constipation problem that i was having with the abraxane its a natural stool softener but i remember the name really works great and cause the big d which many of the laxatives and stool softeners do at work now but will post the name when i get home and yes of course most concerned with the disease being under control but weight is one of my priorities almost ashamed to say have been taking femara since july 2008 no side effects until december i had been taking tamoxifen for 5 years and had terrible vaginal dryness the whole time for which i used replens when i started taking femara i seemed to get better and stopped using femara so much then in december 2008 i noticed a bit of blood on the replens applicator i phoned my hospital and the consultant said it was not unusual the vaginal dryness is back and i have also had thrush it seems that the thrush has returned now and i have a yellow discharge when i see blood i usually see it on the replens applicator i have spoken to the hospital several times and they say that this is a side effect of femara anyone else had troubles like this would appreciate talking to someone love rosie 1138 geez louise it seems like these docs like to deny the existence of se like if they deny them they exist everytime i mention a se they scratch their heads and say hmmmmm i heard of that that why this board is such an amazing gift the taxotere website even lists joint pain as a se so you are not going crazy i still have some joint pain a year later are you getting a neulasta shotthe day after your taxotere a standard but you may not if so that causes awful joint pain for some too taking a claritin and aleve togetherhelps with that pain a weird combo that really works when my onc tells me something is not caused by my chemo i print out stuff from the drug companies and insist he read he does and is open to listening to me otherwise give him the boot i wish you the best there are so many meds better then compazine it made me tired and gave me the jitters for days i prefer zofran or kytril they do not make you sleepy or give the jitters they can also give them iv before the chemo and prevent the vomiting the emend constipated me then the violent diarrhea from the taxotere caused problems you want to hear about are you getting the neuropathy from the taxotere i have founf gabepetin very helpful for that ask for it if you need it i recently finished chemo a c 4 rounds taxol 4 rounds the a c had own boogey men but taxol was completely different with each infusion i got very fatigued after the 2nd day i also got some of the neuropathies but over came almost all of the numbness tingling etc by taking glutamine 10grams 3x day for day 1 infusion day thru day 4 google taxol and glutamine and see what it says also ask your dr before you take it at most health food stores i did get some muscle aches and pains but took tylenol or ibuprophen every 4 hours or longer for about 2 days and it too was gone my theory is to do everything you possibly can to outwit the beast then you feel like maybe you shoulda coulda woulda somewhere down the line everyone is different and every reaction is different they can give you some meds to help before each infusion and send you home with some too if you have reactions you can always call the dr good luck only you can make this decision for yourself listen to your inner bells and do what you feel is best hugs jan cathy let you know what they tell me on thursday the only standard meds they asked me to use are emend for nausea decadron steroid to offset any reaction to the taxotere and zofran another nausea med these are all taken right around the day of chemo day before day of and for one or two days after i also used tylenol for the bone pain from the neulasta but no benadryl was recommended and nothing about b6 although i have seen both of these recommended by others on these boards the bone pain from the neulasta was definitely the worst side effect had i feel lucky to say that and so very interested in the claritin idea i hope you are still feeling well kew thank you so much for all the info you told me more than the gs told me sounds like i should plan to be down for a while just to be on the safe side that sucks about the hair i just grew mine back i have been on tamoxifen since march to keep my estrogen down and so far i have had no problems i was already hot flashing from the chemo so about the same after the oopher onc will switch me to femara if i have problems with that go back to tamoxifen are you having any kindof bone density treatments my onc wants to start me on that real soon too 46 but i still feel too young for all of this i hope you are feeling better denrulzbc rock on sister thanks for all of the help and info on this thread have a great holiday deen ac was much harder while on taxol i also had joint pain nail problems and some neuropathy like the other posters mentioned something nobody else mentioned unless i just missed it was nosebleeds not pouring nosebleeds but frequent slight nosebleeds while on taxol all in all it was much easier to handle than ac karen hi my name is lucy i was on abraxane for 6 months along with avastin abraxane was weekly i recall the dose it may have been 700mg but not positive it was not bad and i lost hair but not bald and had neuropathy on my fingers sore fingers and some nails lifted a bit one finger was really bad had a bloody nose but not bad very light had to have shots for two days after of neupogen which made me very sore and achy hope this helps i started tamoxifen on nov 7th about the same time as you wolfi i am 57 and went through menopause naturally eight years ago had dry skin hot flashes and leg cramps since then so when i started taking tamoxifen the flashes became more severe and frequent again the leg cramps returned with a vengence and the dry skin is still a problem new vaginal dryness but that is getting better on its own also new free floating feelings of anxiety that pop up out of nowhere i attribute that to tamoxifen but rather to having had breast cancer since tamoxifen can create blood clots i would go to the er with your chest heaviness i think you are having a heart attack since you said it gets better with movement and slight exertion if it was your heart the pain would increase with exertion could it be that caught an upper respiratory bug that is making your chest tight in any case you need sleep could the office send a prescription for a little bit of meds for sleep we all feel better if we get quality sleep so many other things resolve themselves when had our healing rest my best wishes to you to get this resolved i do have nail problems but was on ac ddx 4 followed by the same of taxol no toe problems but i have lost 2 fingernails so far and more will fall off later they look pretty horrible as they get ready to depart i also had some neuropathy in fingers and toes fingers ok now still some in feet but my fingers feel really weak hard to open cans and jars etc anyone else notice this with hair head doing ok but still very short though my head is covered quite well my older osn says i look like a calico cat with all the different colors no underarm hair but down south is coming in i just told my onc i do chemo to the level of last time 5 months weekly taxol that disabled me i am now on kadcyla which has much lower se she told me future chemo would be less harsh since they had to hit it hard with taxol since my liver was covered likely agree to start a chemo again but will stop if the neuropathy gets that bad again about quality of life for me morning all just a quick on day 3 of taxol 1 and i feel fine a little tired but that is it so far this has been so much easier for me than ac was like deb i go weekly also no bone pain yet a slight little neuropathy but that started with ac for me i hope everybody is doing fine you are all always in my thoughts and prayers lago glad doing better on aromasin my experience was the awful first year on anastrozole with joint stiffness so bad i could hardly move and relief when i switched the second year to generic aromasin a world of difference only now starting to see some dermatologist has me taking viviscal already was taking biotin and ordered nioxin shampoo to try that have nightly hot flashes but have had those ever since dx when i stopped hrt a lot better on aromasin hi i just found this page i had a mastectomy nov 1 have had 4 dose dense ac and 1 of 4 taxol treatments i have been down and out with bone pain for 2 days now i had some vicadin left from surgery so i took that i will ask my doc about that other medicine you ladies have used this has been a tough journey but chemo will be over in 5 weeks it helps me so much to read all your positive posts going through this together gives me strength sandi high risk stage i no mo er pr her 2 infiltrating lobular age 45 in drug suppression with tamoxifen for 5 years good topic for me right now lots of great advice i was dx with osteoporsis n 2011 which was also the year i was also dx with bc i took a supplement drug early on but my dr also prescribed arimidex which was not a good idea given bone issues so she switched me to tamoxifen the first bone density test was good but the most recent a month ago showed my numbers were slipping onc then prescribed a nasal spray not cheap 58 a month but apparently most drugs for bone issues inexpensive i wanted to see if my insurance would pay for the prolia shots but she said i had to try fossamex first not doing that already have dental issues radiologist friend thinks ses are exaggerated but not taking a chance had acid reflux and vertigo friends recommended magnesium taking that calcium and vitamin d walk a lot it seems all the drugs can have some serious ses i stay very active constantly moving so maybe that will help going off tamoxifen at the 5 year mark august 2016 seem to be helping my bone issues so i guess i will find another med for prevention diane my onc said 100 mg b6 for neuropathy also as well as potassium as my boold pressure is high also iron as my wbc is low they also give me sudafed before the cytoxan to help with the reaction happy first sunday done all my housework to clean up after the holiday and pretty quiet here tomorrow i will go full speed into a really hectic month i have a full dance card already and lots of phone calls and email requests for appointments wondering if i should charge a premium for early morning and evening appointments since that is all i can do for them hmmmhunky hope you are feeling better soon you have more than paid your dues anitbiotics really mess up my digestive system i always eat yogurt with live cultures i had so many rounds of last year that i started taking acidophilus i made you a little parfait claire your lifestyle sounds like a terrible way to suffer poor girl yes keep that insurance if i were you been pretty lucky that dh has good insurance but just before my little adventure with medical care he lost his job and insurance we had to get an indiviual policy and it was very expensive cover much and they were very particular about conditions i waited for 6 months to go to the dr so that we would have group insurance again at his new job what the heck is leftover champagne we had half a bottle of veuve clicquot on the counter after everyone left and dh asked me what to do with it i said that i understand the question he clarified that hemeantwhat is the best way to store an open bottle of champagne with furrowed brow ipoured it into 2 glasses and carried it into the bedroom duh beanie tips up lol i like your avatar i thought the kitty was laughing not whining been trying to find a laughing corgi pic so i can join the party cuz you look like you are having a great time been on tamoxifen for about a year and a half and gained weight know if i canblame the rx lost hair which is ok cuz i have a lot lostmy auntflo and now my knees hurt like an old person i know how much of this i can attribute to the tamoxifen as i am also approaching 50 yikes but looking forward to gettingoff it someday hope share your sailboat with your htl friends sure we can get the tenders to help man the sails our first sailing adventure should be to go rescue the sisters nm so glad you are on the east coast so you can manage the morning buffets awesome you and the tenders have outdone yourselves once again that coffee is too cute to drink we have some coffee baristas here who make capuccinos that you want to drink cuz they are too perty i always try to sip from the side so i disturn the pattern my favortie is the heart hoping dd stays at the bakery

them so busy well my scrawny little just crawled in my lap he rarely does this and he is purring maybe the tenders can start a fire in the fireplace for me before they go to housefor the dinner party hate to disturb this kitty thanks guys i was fec and then docetaxol and i took my nausea medications the day before chemo and for four days after because phobic about vomiting i can honestly say i had no problems with nausea maybe a touch of queasiness but i think it was more nerves about nausea than actual nausea the medication my doc ordered was prochlorazine i think an oldy but goody good luck i hope that something works for you hi gals been on tamoxifen for 4 months for breast cancer the last few weeks my knees have starting aching normally very fit and active and never have any kind ofjoint pains it only feels somewhat better if i straighten both knees i read a lot of your posts about joint pain and saw quite a bit of reference to hip pain anyone else having trouble with their knees i have three kids at home youngest in elementary school and this joint pain thing just makes me feel like that is there any remedy or do you just endure titan my dr wants me to take fosomax she gave me my choice i chose weekly because i might forget the monthly pill in addition to 1500 mg of calcium day 500mg 3 times a day and continue with 2000 units of d3 i know that weight bearing exercise also helps which i plan on doing getting back to after i get my daughter off to college jenc i had weekly taxol and on about week 3 or 4 i started with the pain which only got worse with each week it got to the point that i hated to be touched and my bones just hurt so bad i took vicodin aleve and soaked in the tub a lot all i can say is take your pain medicine as prescribed when i finally gave into taking the vicodin and listened to the dr and took it regularly with the aleve twice a day i was able to get some relief not complete but enough in addition during each infusion i would get the worst backache that would disappear that night and not return until the taxol pain started 3 days later ahh the joys of chemo i am 45 diagnosed at 41 i am also highly er pr i did zoladex injections similar to lupron for 1 years the shot produces estrogen symptons in your body dryness mood swings hotflashes and weight gain i got tired of the injection and my oncologist highly recommended removing my ovaries last year if anything my mood swings have tempered out now that the ovaries are gone i still have the same symptons as i was having with the shot i did not second guess my decision there is a solution to most of the s of both the shot and surgically removing the use replens and lots of ky jelly hotflashes well you learn to hate them and have them either way i take 75mg of effexor which has reduced the intensity and number of hotflashes sleep with a fan on and get really good at flipping my bed covers on and off lol for the weight gain i have started doing weight watchers since september and interval training on treadmill down 17 pounds so far so it can be done with effort it is a tough decision but you may want to try the shot out for awhile to allow your body to get use to the idea the first year is the hardest being slammed into menopause un naturally michele hey lex our diagnoses sound similar no chemo for me two lumpectomies and radiation for 30 doses 25 regular 5 boost i started tamoxifen the day before i started rads checked out this thread because i was looking for information on effexor realize that joint pain and cramping were a se tried the soap under the sheets last night for the foot and toe cramping but not sure if it worked since i was having so much back pain i take my tamox in the am but may start trying to take it at night still deciding if i want to start effexor for the hot flashes i am trying to catch up on what i have missed on this thread so far i have made it to page 50 but i am skipping a few in between chiquita tell your onc what is going on so he can fix it if you tolerate taxotere maybe he can switchyou to taxol and thatmight be easier on you but give up thesetaxane drugs are supposedly very good in kicking butt like diana 50 said btw diana 7 years wow congrats now thati like tohear going for taxotere 3 in 2 days my first cocktail was adriamycin cytoxin and 5fu it knocked down my wbc and i had anemia twice i had no appetite on all 4 treatments for a good 5 days on the taxotere eatting like a bear but i am sooo tired and i get pretty bad headaches that i think might be from my sinus being so dried out anyone elseexperience that i have 2 types of cancer in my right breast ductal carcinoma and mucinous carcinoma which i belive is highly unusual unfortunately it has spread to my lymph nodes so i am doing 6 months of chemo and then surgery then radiation i am on 5 of taxol and the side effects are just starting to kick in hair loss nausea aches and pains and numbness in feet hands no family history of breast cancer so this has been a big shock to me and my family i am leaning towards a double mast because i do not want to go through this again healing thoughts to all you ladies mandy netter 2 rounds of radiation in and sounding good my drive will be 1 each way as well are you doing the driving yourself at this point i was figuring it wouldnt be possible but would love to hear what you are sorry to hear of the issues you are having heart wise hope the new normal is not forever i too have some heart things to watch for and am hoping that with all the scans and such they do on us well keep on top of it re taxol pains while there seems to be a wide range of severity the pattern of when it hits is seems to run more consistent good day of treatment and 2 days following then pain hits night of day 3 and lasts for 3 4 days for me what i thought was only deep bone pain turned out to be that but primarily nerve pain i also got some significant pins and needles on fingers and toes during the height of the pain and yes the ovary pain too talk about weird side effects just speaks to the fact that this is some serious chemical soup they are pumping into us really those still getting their periods just what we need on top of this i got mine for the first two cycles of ac they stopped after that not sure if i want them back or to stay away i think ill want them back if i had a choice practically jumped when i caught my reflection in the mirror yesterday afternoon was feeling pretty good just doing stuff around the house no on or head covering hadnt even drawn on eyebrows whoa who is that still catches me by surprise katiak have fun watching your boys play hockey and i hope that the gland things doesnt turn into anything my hubs has a nasty head cold that just turned up out of nowhere hope i dont get it im feeling good today and thrilled not to have to be fuzzy headed on pain meds i do not like that one bit i know ive missed a ton of people here but can only scroll back so far before my brain gets full wishing everyone a good day hi everyone fatigue from 3 ac had me feeling 98 instead of 58 at times this past weekend lol feeling good now working out my strategy in preparation for my last ac next week a lot more water sleep and better nutrition hope it works ellebee what a real friend such a nice touching story yes i am going onto taxol next noticed some calling it taxol and some calling it taxotere are they one and the same thanks marcia 1111 i did feel better after some sleep an30 my eyebrows have thinned but still here i also have eyelashes but 4 might do them in thanks for the info ellebee stephaniejm pamelahope thanks for the amazon and vitacost info check out all of those out take care everyone it be long until all finished wish i stayed on xeloda the were mild for me and gave me much freedom from the treatment room taxol kicked my butt to the curb hair loss and total fatique now on navelbine injectable but are also mild best wishes to you for a long stay on the next treatment lynda hi ladies finished 2 taxol yesterday so far it seems okay some nausea and stomach burn this time i got emend tabs hopefully this should work they also added tagamunt in iv for stomach burn for all those who are going thru taxol or completed it when did your taste buds return also with the nail problems did anyone try tea tree oil or any other preventive measures if so what worked or dimished the problem my nails are 50 blackened with ac and looks ugly i know what taxol will do to them my palms and feet are darker color and havedark brown spots the dr said this is common specially since we have darker skin asian i know when they will look a little normal carolyn thanks for your reply i had fatigue on day and then it got a little better my counts areon the lower end and the office is trying to get insurance approval forprocrit or arnasep for my hemaglobin rbcs hopefully with thismy energylevel will be better due to low counts the dr want me to go back to work yet and i have no energy to drive 25 miles each way take care desi i had very similar dx info and bilateral mastectomies though originally i was to need only arimidex used for postmenopausal er which i was at age 59 then my oncotypedx recurrence score came back at 27 and my oncologist strongly encouraged chemo i was also in shock and cried more over that news than the original breast cancer diagnosis i finished 4 cycles cytoxan and taxotere in mid march tolerated it well for the most part back on the arimidex for 5 years ask your oncologist about arimidex i think the risk of blood clots is less than tamoxifen however with osteoporosis that may mean need a bone strengthener bisophosphate like zometa which i just began one iv infusion every 6 months so far no problem with that either though there are some rare but scary side effects lots of options to discuss with your oncologist hi everyone just checking in chemo tomorrow and then next tues will be my last one i wish the steroids bother me so much seems i only have one or two days when i dont feel so jittery last weeks taxol has taken my eyebrows and most of my bottom eyelashes what a sight lol my hair is so white with very little black in it i am ready to color it hugs to all my mom had nausea off and on during all her chemo treatments some chemo is worse than others gemzar and ixempra were the worst for nausea mom had liver mets so not sure whether it was that or the chemo at the end does your mom have nausea meds like zofran my onc told us to take them whether there is nausea or not to keep ahead of it peggy rach i had no movement for days which resulted in terrible stomach cramps on first tax this time i asked for something and they gave me movicol sachets been a god send had plenty of movement so touch wood no cramps so far hope that helps what a subject for teatime while your eating your marmite rach pass the remote along and debs pass the twiglets too wait till passing the wine along girls speedy recovery to you all luv pauline xxx after one round of taxotere and xeloda my hair has started coming out by the handfuls so without too much thinking it out i jumped in the car and drove myself to my black barber and got it cut really short guess you could say i got my swag on we go there quite a bit as my boys keep their head almost shaved but i can imagine the customers were shocked seeing an overweight 55 year old white woman sitting in the chair getting her hair cut it was all good now i can say swagalicious log in to post a reply congrats to you guys who got off the taxol train woot woot i found vicodin much of a help last night i had the bone pain but it was dull and i kept falling asleep on the couch and waking up with strange feelings someone was in the house with me if i have a glass or 2 of good red wine i relax i given any restrictions but the wine seems to mellow out the bone pain the most i miss normal days a lot hi kathylon sure many other folks here will be able to give you lots of good information and will share their experiences as far as i know taxotere will cause you to lose all your hair you might want to look for threads under the chemotherapy topic about cytoxan taxotere they can tell you what to expect about side effects hi girls sounds as though we are all having our treatments this week in as much that taxol has been much worse for me than a c was i am almost giddy knowing that thursday is my last treatment i believe that most of you have such short lived side effects with taxol i have four days of extreme leg aches and nausea to boot i have a new anti nausea that i will be trying this time around but either way i know i can handle another couple of weeks of feeling like crap terry like you i have a twin sister she had a mammogram last thursday that came back highly suspicious so she is having an ultrasound this thursday makes me so mad on a shelfish note i wanted to be so done with this stuff now i will play the waiting game to see if my sister will be alright either way i will be here to support her i had my radiation before my chemo so i really am on my last leg of this journey it is scarey to think that after i have my port removed in september that they are kicking me out to regain normalsy what the heck is that anyway good luck to all of you this week i pray that your will be mild peace terri yes most of the neuropathy symptoms went away fairly soon after stopping taxol except for the slight numb feeling which is fine the first scan after three months was nead and we did two more cycles after that when i told my onc about the pain she said we should not do a sixth cycle i really depended on her to stop me before there would be permanent trouble she knew how important my dancing is to me i am thankful it worked so well and i have to risk losing that barb i took tamoxifen for 2 years and finally could not tolerate the side effects i tried femara and the joint pain was intolerable i stopped the tamoxifen for 2 months to see if the side effects went away i felt great i started aromasin last march the side effects are tolerable at htis point i still have fatigue and joint pain but much less as much as i hated how i felt with tamoxifen i was afraid to change meds mostly for a new set of side effects everyone tolerates the meds differetly also if the med is not tolerable for you you can always stop it and go back to one of the other ones hope it goes well for you young was on tamoxifen and lexapro until recently when i decided i was fed up with the sexual ses of lex and wanted to get back on wellbutrin to have a better handle on my depression you take wellbutrin with tamox they say anyway i know that tamoxifen causes hot flashes and mine were bad before i went off but since i went off the tamox and the lexapro i have horrible hot flashes and deep chills i think the lexapro really did a lot to ward off hot flashes i had no idea while i was on it now looking into taking a little bit of lex with my wellbutrin see so lexapro may help vitamin e is good also iu per day vitamin c can help reduce hot flashes if you take enough of it and so does b6 still in the process of trying those i carry a fan around with me and i layer i fantasize about inventing a clothing line for women that has sleeves and pant legs that can retract during a hot flash anyway i hope things get better for you soon ace alfranco my ps a fan of implants he prefers to use your own tissue that being said he told me i have enough stomach or inner thigh fat to use to reconstruct not sure whose body he was looking at i think i have plenty of spare flesh since be having rads my reconstruction will have to wait months after done anyway so we really decide on anything specific yet so the neuropathy and nail issues are starting already one day after taxol some of my nails are sore and i have some weird sensitivity issue with some of my fingertips ugh so far my toes and toenails feel fine i guess definitely going to have to suck it up and ice better next time just three treatments to go just three treatments to go just three treatments to go oh and i think losing half of one eyebrow how stupid does that look lol pjkappel andothers thanks for letting me know about work and how dealt with it this is the end of my 2nd week back at work but also my 4th month of chemo so i came back to work at a tough time i really wanted to make this work so badly but things seem to be going well the taxol just had number 7 of 12 is absolutely awful for me the bone pain is getting even worse and now my nails are falling off but what i just noticed this week is that i am not able to finish many of my sentences while speaking as a teacher that really work well i feelconfused this week and i think my speech is clear all the time taxol is just very tough on me it started out so fine and then just gets worse and worse for me each week venting this is so hard i just want to crawl into a ball and cry and cry and then i think of bilateral mx recovery from that weeks and weeks of daily rads reconstruction it is sometimes too much to even think about i guess as chemo goes on it just wears on me more and more thanks for listeningvickie i finished chemo and looked back since i have finished my 12 weekly herceptin and will start the 3 week protocol and should finish next october 6 weeks out and all my hair is starting to grow in have enough to see if it will be curly or straight but some of it is dark 6 weeks out of taxol and i feel pretty wonderful lots of energy few naps and my thought processes are better neuropathy is a pain but getting better to good days karen peggy i asked yesterday what i was getting 4 mg decadron with the halaven and aloxi for nausea i get 1 mg of ativan with my infusion too i take it any other time but when i get infused i believe they may have had me at 12 mg at first but i know it was at least at 8 also had 9 infusions so far and have held onto my head hair but eyebrows have fled the coop opposite of what happened with tac one reason i reduced the decadron was the horrible crash i had i hope that is what is going on with your mom if she was that energized from the decadron then she probably is just crashing and should be better soon sorry she is going through all this the fatigue i get with this chemo is much less than tac but it seems to last longer the trial nurse told us yesterday that they are hearing really good things about this chemo oh man lost my post i made it through my first week of rads and my onc insisted i take tamoxifen right away due to my 90 er positive status i tried really hard to weasel out of it until after rads but it work lol so as of today i have taken 6 days of tamox and have had only a couple side effects mild fatigue but that could be from heat and intensified hot the hot flashes are ny far the biggest pain since i have had them since chemo i did try low dose effexor for a couple of days but felt sick from it so i stopped but that was during chemo i am going to give it another whirl and see if it helps i will keep everyone posted since i know most of us are dealing with hot flahes i am just curious if i will ever get my period back i am only 35 y o for those that have gone through chemo have you gotten yours back hope everyone is having a great weekend hi ladies i thought it was the tamoxifen giving me a rash on my face and around the wound of some healing skin on the cancer side my doc looked at it and said i am having an allergic reaction to the neosporin i have been using on the wound for the past 7 weeks i would have never figured that one out hope everyone is having a great day msgirl 4 hi i too had adriamycin and cytoxin every 2 weeks 2 years ago i was premedicated with zofran iv zantac po and decadron iv to combat nausea and vomiting the next day i got a neulasta shot to keep the blood counts up 2 days later i would feel body aches fatigue and nausea by the third treatment my hands and feet had blistered so they decided not to do the fourth treatment cetaphil cream on my hands and feet helped and i kept them covered at night i had to wait 4 weeks for the skin to heal then they started the next treatments of paclitaxil and herceptin herceptin was weekly for 12 weeks then every 3 weeks for a year total and paclitaxil was every 3 weeks for 12 weeks fortunately they said i did not need the neulasta as my counts were good i thought the body aches would be gone for good unfortunately i was wrong two days later my bones ached so bad i could not sleep tyl 3 helped some but resorted to ambien for some much needed rest yes i continued to work full time i am a nurse in the or and fortunately my took some of my call during treatments so i get called in the middle of the night i had treatments on wednesdays and i started to feel bad on fridays which was tough to work at times but knowing i had the weekends to rest helped by the third paclitaxil treatment i had some tingling in my feet that slowly went away when the paclitaxil was done herceptin itself was no problem just fatigue as of now i am 2 years post diagnosis and currently in between hormonal treatments started with arimidex then changed to aromasin due to side effects now waiting to start tamoxifen once the side effects of aromasin wear off going for mammo next week many thanks hilly 1 clare 83 and lynnq sorry you are all suffering too but it does feel a little better that not just me and a reason i also was on tamoxifen for 2 years and have been on leterazole almost a year 58 but like you feel 88 i did have acupuncture for hot flushes and insomnia soon after finished treatment which was 3 years ago but think about having it for this thanks for reminding me still having awful hot flushes so it may help that too thanks everyone xx hi all glad to hear so many of us are finishing up 8 weeks pfc and spend most days peering into the mirror looking for hair it is coming in but too slow for my taste i am soooo ready to go topless had my first mammogram since rads on friday wow where did 6 months go other than some fluid build up beneath the incision site not unusual all is well glad to have that behind me the taxotere caused some radiation recall another lovely side effect and the area is still a little inflamed so i was a little concerned about getting the mamm but it went fine started femara last week so far so good there hope treatments are going well thanks smitty my doctors want to prescribe anything although the mo prescribed the sleep aid and xanax can be i wonder how common it is that women on tamoxifen have to take another med in order to tolerate the ses of tamoxifen such as insomnia sounds like a topic for another thread cammy 2 i am sure there is lots of discussion about on the chemo thread and probably elsewhere hopefully someone who knows this site better can help you could try the search feature too sorry to hear that you have had the seroma problems after your bilat and nerve pain are you getting help with that exercises heat cold meds our bodies sure get beat up through all of this i had ac every two weeks so i could maybe help with that but never had taxol for me the biggest se not including hair loss of course was major fatigue and mild nausea i slept a lot and feel up to eating very much i remember crying all the time which my chemo nurse said was partly due to the decadron it hyped me up then emotionally crash afterward well it was probably also me not handling this whole thing too well either i enjoyed soups and toast crackers mild juices and cooked veggies once i started taking kytril about half way through treatment most of the nausea issues eased up the effects for me were cumulative so that by the end i was really zonked i ended up getting shingles which was treated and cleared up towards the end of treatment i got mouth sores but it was also treatable i had a great response to chemo and i know many ilc women do good morning ladies i feel like i should be feeling this badly so soon i took myself to the drs yesterday for the neulasta shot what is usually an hour drive took me an hour and a half besides having to stop twice to use the bathroom thank god for along the way i was driving like the little old men usually complaining about the diarrhea has finally stopped but probably because i seem to tolerate eating anything trying to stay hydrated taking the emend so i really say nauseous just have no interest in any food this damn cytoxan headache just go away my onc nurse suggested sudafed the one where you have to show your liscence and sign your life away i took it and an atavan when i got home and managed a few hours of sleep took it again last night and slept off and on last night i would wake up and say just get up and do something the brain was willing but the body said no way i just made myself get up and feed the dogs but being in an upright position brought the headache back so going back to bed as soon as i finish here i cried to my onc nurse yesterday that i think i would feel this badly this fast she told me everyone is different and not to compare myself with anyone else kind of hard to do 57 and was very active and now i feel 90 every bone in my body hurts i a clue how some of you ladies are working while you are going thru this sorry for all of the moaning and groaning but no one else really understands cafelvr how are you this morning on the same schedule and same tx juneaubugg i bet at age 44 your natural estrogen levels were high and you had to undergo a huge change when tamox flipped the switch i do hope you get relief soon you know i started my tamox in the month of nov and my flsshes were barely noticeable but kicked in the following summer even tho i should have been used to the tamox by then opposite to you gabapentin help my flashes or neuropathy while effexor did the more i read stories about tamox the more it seems to very from person to person and it seems not only to be hormone levels but probably a base body temp and their individual metabolism as well as a lot of external factors all i can say is try to look for what might set off your worst flashes and try to avoid it meece every girl likes a change of footwear so if you want to come out of the boots i found you some maribou trimmed heels that would look great having a good run on taxol starting in dec 2012 minimal and hair thinning but no loss yet last scan showed stable boy was my friend hope to be on it a long long time neuropathy and diarrhea are my main neurontin and immodium are my friends whining is totally acceptable here welcome robin and aoibheann hugs to all i did 12 weekly taxol i had gotten deathly ill on the ac dose dense so taxol was a breeze considering how ill i was as i went into the taxol i was feeling much better by the time i was finished i only had numb toes my legs felt heavy so it was hard to climb stairs andi was very tired as they had upped my steroids thinking i had an allergic reaction to the taxol but i had gotten scabies when i was hospitalized while on ac yuck always get a skin test if you have a rash they do it and assumed it was from the taxol my hair grew back while i was on taxol and i got strange lines on my nails but no black nails and that all went away my toes are normal too though that took a few months good afternoon all been awhile yet again in awe that some of you can stay so focused and participate so much in the group i have to say the treatments are kickin my butt the last being the worst thursday is my last chemo treatment i thought i would be celebrating but i find myself more scared of going thru it right now but at least the last one onc had told me that the t would be easier than the a c i think so even though nice not to be as nauseous i have at least 2 good days where i actually throw up and the help i was also told to expect about 48 hrs of bone pain starting on day 2 or 3 post treatment more like 4 to 5 days and then severe arthritic type pain and severe tiredness and allover weakness sets in for about a week i have felt pretty good yesterday and today off and on arthritis pain in mainly my hands and feet but nothing to the point it was last week hang in there girls and a big congrats to ms emma hugs christy ithink this has to be the busiest board on this site phew minxie bc can make us all very numb and emotionless i think especially when you hear so much its too much to take in obxk you are getting croissants from france sounds very decadent really wrong with american ones kathyrnn maxine is my role model ha ha you and cocker crack me up you are hilarious thanks you for making us laugh its what we all need bernie thanks for the chuckle lmao victoria good luck with the port and the tests a horrible time eh my last 4 treatments were taxotere 2 more to go agree with obkx kicked in couple of days after like you said thought had worse hangovers good analogy and everytime i felt crap i thought to myself if its doing this to me it must be kicking butt stayshiny hope your last treatment went well riley sorry you lost all your nails did they not give you frozen gloves to wear i do only for the hands though and although my nails are weaker i still have them that would suck linali good luck at the marathon to anyone else and all of you have a wonderful day and good luck at the casino kathy hugs and positive vibes to you all musosgirl so happy that on the mend feeling better is a great thing superius ovarian suppression os tamoxifen is one arm of a big ongoing study called the soft study that shows that os tamox or os an aromatase inhibitor ai might be superior to tamoxifen alone for women with er breast cancer this particular focus on her 2 though read a few things that suggest that er pr her 2 bc might have a better prognosis with os too the thing it all comes down to quality of life and cardiac bone health use myself as an example because in my mid 30s my mo wants me to try tamoxifen alone first if my periods come back which i suspect they will my ovaries have always been stubborn girls and i want to try os willing to do it but cautioned me that it will keep my body in full menopause okay with that because the tamoxifen will exert a protective effect on my heart and behaves a lot like estrogen in the body and those two systems are the ones most affected by the sudden and ongoing drop in estrogen caused by ovarian suppression she want me to take an ai because ais exert that protective effect and the ses can be more intense primarily joint pain than those caused by tamoxifen some women with certain genetic mutations brca palb 2 try os before opting for an oophorectomy to see what menopause is like for them honestly got all the symptoms right swear chemo has aged me by years i can see it in my technically my ovaries are still intact whatever that means ultimately it depends on 1 menopausal status 2 your preference and 3 your preference in that order if one is already menopausal an ai inhibitor is a given a link that breaks down the soft results whew that was a lot of medicalese it over here feeling pretty good last chemo is the 25th and because the last one not dreading it quite as much as i have in the past i have some kind of sinus thing going on which i blame on the dry furnace air and been having more bone pain this round especially in my hips and lower back but that light at the end of the tunnel is getting brighter and brighter chomping at the bit to schedule my prophylactic mx but might have to wait until may given my teaching schedule i harbor a secret fear that if i do that find something creepy in righty so hoping that i can have it done right at the beginning of january we shall see how it shakes out i was given my first rx for arimidex last week and i am terrified to start taking it i am predisposed to androgenic alopecia i know this because a i have been battling hair loss since i went through menopause 15 years ago and b i have experience with anti estrogen meds which i took in my younger years as part of my fertility treatments that always caused shedding while i was on them to compound the problem i also take thyroid meds which can exacerbate the hair loss issue i once had excessively thick hair and i have probably lost 50 60 from the crown thru the top and at the front and temples because my hair was so thick to begin with most people think i have a normal head of hair especially those who know me back in the day i keep my hair extremely short now and that helps to mask the thinning over the years i have tried biotin nizoral shampoo nioxin various other supplements recommended for hair loss but none ever worked and eventually i gave up on them the last 6 months or so however the shedding has slowed considerably for no apparent reason and the thought of having it all start up again is enough to make me refuse the ai completely i know that sounds crazy but the stress that would bring is almost as scary as a recurrence of bc i am beside myself hi there just a quick update been taking the pills since monday and been nauseaus and light headed getting better and easier each day onc gave me a new i will be trying tomorrow the bad news my platelets are down to 43 started at 290 last fri down to 180 on monday and now this at 25 they would have stopped tx so i squeeked by and they say after tomorrow they start building back up as from tdm 1 the pills are elevating my liver enzymes through the roof but again not in any danger yet and to be expected the good news my breast tissue already feels softer after one week and the woman who went before me got to ned in 6 weeks so that would be worth it all in the meantime have to be careful with gab not to get bruised or cut but my wbc and rbc are great so yay overall a pretty good appointment all in all slept a ton in the car my dh went today so my parents got a break hopefully next fri too merry to those who celebrate we did hanukkah on sunday night since i was out of town on monday and the gifts were all hits even bought myself a pair of shoes do you have a general practitioner or family doctor maybe they can get you what you need i have no idea what drs hold back on pain or antidepressant meds gesh recently my depression has crept back in this winter i am sure it is due to my current treatment of taxol losing my dad losing my hair blah blah blah oh yeah and i have stage iv cancer for the first time i saw the behavioral pysc our cancer center in the fall it helped just to get my feelings out validate all the bs that was going on i have had good success with zoloft and with celebrex i am on effexor 150 mg if i miss a dose i can tell celebrex helped with pain it is trial and error for some the change in temp getting warmer is helping me i am trying to take outdoor walks not sleep so much i did read where ambien or ativan can contribute to depression in the long run so i cut back on them a bit good luck one day at a time the biggest step is recognizing it hi kobeobe re your question on paclitaxol be having no 7 paclitaxel on thursday and the chemo nurses tell me not as harsh as the fec or t so less ok for a couple of days after and then dip a bit for a few days and then ok again but different never been so tired that i go out but as you know all about listening to your body and just resting when you need to been ok on the immunity and white blood cells have increased every week although did have a set back as like you i developed a blood clot mine was because of the port and a previous op i had and the downside is i have to self inject clexane for another 2 months never been given steroids to have before or after chemo and these go in before the pax along with piriton paracetamol and anti sickness they also said to me that pax make you feel sick and i was fine on sickness up till no 5 and then think it caught up with me and they gave me emend and an aloxi so i would insist on it just in case got through the fec which been told is worse than the pax so the next stage is definitely doable good luck with your treatment xxx sign me up for the belly fat club too also taking tamoxifen although it make you feel any better glad not the only person who is experiencing the extra belly fat i just thought it was because i did a lot of sitting around while my husband made sure i had plenty to eat after surgery and during chemo lolabout theweightlifting does anyone know howheavy i can liftafter having 3 lymph nodes removed on left side and 5 removed on the right i was lifting regularly a couple of years ago and want to start again but i havethe fear of getting lymphedema rina i have nail problems as bad as lago i thikn becasue i had taxol vs taxotere which i believe is harder on nails but i did have a few turn yellowish and lift in the corners i kept them filed short with polish on i also soaked them in white vinegar and water prevents infection and dabbed a little tea tree oil on them my mo said that was fine it took about a year pfc for them to finally look normal again i know about letting them get as long as possible though i would think they would be more likley to lift and snag that way i also slept with cotton white manicure gloves that helped keep them moisuturized what a crappy se kellogs that is very good to heari love robin roberts loved her even before she has had to go through all the cancer crap wanted to remind everyone that she is on tonight talking with diane sawyer i just saw a preview will def be watching painthesky did the tamoxifen make the swelling worse i have it in my left arm and the forearm seems the most swollen thanks farmlovergrl hey rita thanks rita you are so sweet no i really had too many none that were too bad really the 1st tx i had diarrhea so bad but i got smart and took immodium which helped my nose is running all the time from the taxotere i have heard i also get stomach cramps which are pretty bad sometimes the thing that bothers me most is the low wbc week and one day never sure which day i get achey fever and chills i just have to drink lots of fluids take my temperature a few times and take ibuprofen to help with the fever i just rest usually go to bed early i nausea and have even been hungry so hungry i think most of the other were from the neupogen shots i had the 1st tx my lower back ached so bad i have never had a back ache that bad still dealing with the hairloss issue i am very emotional about it but i have been lucky because so many other women have had alot worse from their tx i am halfway through and will be getting my reconstruction nov 7th so be getting implants andallduring the holidays be getting them filled it will be so good to have thisall over take care thanks for checking on me i have had trouble getting in to this new format think any easier than the old one happy weekend harley what great stories i started out stage 4 march 2012 just before turning 35 at least we found out after the first round of chemo and the 5cm mass in my chest was shrinking from chemo was also 5cm in my left breast and in my lymph nodes after 2 rounds of taxol and herceptin remember if anything else and some time adding perjetta ssometimes all a blur we had also taken a month break between treatments due to a drop in heart functions which bounced back during that month after chemo also had to use markers for surgery of a lumpectomy where they found no more cancer in my left breast or lymph nodes after chemo after healing from surgery did 5 weeks of radiation to my chest which only shows scaring left behind and ned the plan was to remain on herceptin and perjetta forever accept we were just about to switch the perjetta to tdm 1 well i had been coughing badly for some time i did a treatment end of june than left for a month to see family and a quick scan and anantibiotics while on my trip coughing just got worse had even tried steroid breathing treatment also my insurance lapsed while away and was difficult to get back and was to sick to start treatments back up was just getting worse and worse and know why so when i went back to my doctor end of october went straight to the hospital to be admitted to find out what this was had lost 50lbs in the last 2 months and got way to weak 15 days in the hospital and many tests it was a staph infection in my lung may have gotten it taking my husband to the va for hrs where he was diagnosed with gout in both ankles so far i am still ned i still had herceptin or anything since june so according to the scans we have been doing on the infection on my lung infection nothing has shown up so we last spoke about the possibility of actually not going back on anything i did a pet scan last monday and got a phone call today to come in tomorrow morning for results fingers crossed and lots of pray parislexi i was just taken off tamoxifen for the same reaction apparently itching is a side effect of too the itching is neurological you are probablycreating the rash by scratching skin breakdown and infection are the big risks even after i went off the tamoxifen it took a 6 day predisone treatment to still the itching topical ointments work although gold bond anti 0itching lotions help a bit the antihistimine atarax helps at night so you can sleep good luck you need to see your doctor i am going to be put on arimidex next i already am concerned that the itching will just return my oncologist wants me to try it anyway itching can be caused by lack of estrogen since that is what these medications do i see how one will have less than the other golfergrandma sitting here with one eye open this evening but did pop in long enough to take note to your post i too was a 6 month i did take my cytoxan orally with 2 infusion of m and f per month butbottom line took zofran exclusively and never experienced nausea constipation big yeppers and finally figured out the appropriate amount of miralax must have been a slow learner asifinally gotthe balance down between tooooooo much and not enough by about month 4 anyhooooo just wanted to put my two cents in for zofran and yes the cmf regimenwas quite doable tothe ladies who more than gave me a bundle of support through my txts of2008 2009 and beyond believe me when i say youall rocked and the support from you all was off the charts i hope thati have continued to give in my own way with myparticipation locally with newly diagnosed as well as my continued support in the breast reconstruction support group here in seattle as well looking forward to my 4th year participating in the komen 3 day 60 miler this year in seattle and san diego although my time spent at seems to be a bit scarce these days i am forever grateful for the warm thoughtful and intelligent dialogue of my sista friends rita fairways and greens my friend lapatinib i am currently taking lapatinib as clinical drugs trial have had some side effects fatigue breathless flu like aches and pains and rash but after 8 weeks they have got worse consultant stopped the drugs and i am curretly having scans and blood tests to make sure the breast cancer has not spread i had masectomy 1st feb i have found it very draining and was starting to doubt that my energy and get up and go will ever return i have my bone scan next thursday and hopefully results of all tests and scans friday radiotheraphy has been put on hold till results but my consultant thinks he will with draw me from the trials and i will have to go on herceptine as i am her 2 positive and was told that the new drug make give me a better chance of the cancer not returning mind works overtime with every ache and pain 2 and 2 makes ten taking pain killers every day till we know why i am in so much rib back and groin pain sound familiar to anyone i am fearing the worst didley oh mama 26 so many hugs for you ugh how long did you have to stay i was hospitalized for 4 days for neutropenic with fever after round 2 wbc and anc were zero this all with neulasta shot the day after chemo and they dose reduced 15 for round 3 and my counts dropped low but not to zero and no fever so i avoided the hospital today i got my final ac woohoo and as the same dose from round 3 soooo hoping i avoid the hospital again this time the reduction in dose did nothing to help my side effects i still went down for the count by day 7 in bed for 3 days horrible diarrhea headache sorethroat shakiness etc so to be honest i really feel any difference with the dose reduction but my counts were a little better although they said i was still considered neutropenic just not severe as previous round i also asked about taxol and impact on white counts and since mine go so low i was told that taxol completely different and the drop in counts during ac are not an indication for taxol and we will have to wait and see ugh i am not a fan of the waiting game i hope at least you are feeling a little better it took me a full week to feel any better from my hospital stay funny the day after i got home i could not get out of bed and i expected because i was home to feel better hope this is not the case for you mary not sure if in menopause or just the taxol effects i have the worst hot flashes all evening night long and my last period was back at the beginning of june but read on here that it can still come back again after a few months so who knows i am taking a sickie day today i even feel that bad right now but yesterday i felt so nauseaus all day long and came home from work early so i thought if i start feeling bad today i might just take some type of sleeping pill and sleep the day away i also forgot to mention that i have gained 16lbs since starting chemo wtf i dispise my body right now and i dream of exercising and swimming and dieting i even recognise myself in the mirror anymore my try to reassure me that at least i look like one of those really skinny sickly cancer patients but i help thinking that i enjoyed being skinny even if it meant i looked sickly in on your vacation plans a bone density test would probably be a good idea to get a base line of where you are now if you had any before been getting them for years as i have a family history of osteoporosis and i went through natural menopause fairly young 44 6 mths after starting femara i was still ok but last month my latest density test shows that at 1 years on it i now have osteoporosis so on fosamax now not a long or hard test basically it just an your hip area machine will move some but not all of your body at least the machine that have done my density tests susan elesha i did the 4 a c and now have 1 more taxol to go i did 4 of those every other week called dose dense i lie it sucks but it is doable with the a c i felt for 4 or 5 days i worked from home through it but did go in to the office a few times and even though it feels like the end of chemo will never get here it will i believe i started this in january and i have 1 tx left april got here a lot faster than i thought if they give you a neulasta shot to bring up your white blood cell count make sure you take claritan not d the day before and several days after i found it really works for the minor bone pain the meds get for nausea are great i can honestly say that i never felt nauseaus a little queazy but nothing major i munched on some saltines and drank gingerale my mo said that they find that however you were during pregnancy you can expect to be about the same they know why but it was true for me at least having a much easier time on taxol virtually no side effects just the bottoms of my feet are peeling strange some minor bone pain but a couple of advil and good to go take a deep breath you will get through this i agree with rachel i have taxol but did have neuropathy from chemo but what describing sound like the norm by no means saying anything bad but something you need to make an appt for and have either the rads onco or the med onco check it out no point of you being in pain and you need to find out the cause and then the onco can go from there best wishes nancy liz your rasta tit cracked me up got a dreadlock going there how about a mullet we want pictures sally did you do a taxol chemo that causes neuropathy if not the cause probably get a brain mri to rule out ms by now sure picked up all throw rugs etc that could cause a fall very worried about you please keep us posted i was watching what not to wear last night and they said the average woman on the show tries on 20 different pairs styles of jeans before finding the right pair but they seen any of us buttless wonders on the show someone nominate me please anne was afraid to take tamoxifen at first i was diagnosed undiagnosed re diagnosed with pcos over the years one doctor told me it was the diagnosis de jour he undiagnosed me the last time i looked up pcos the definition was really broad suprised there are women it fit i definitely had the irregular periods hair acne infertility issues always been thin so some docs excluded me from that reason my concerns as far as taking tamoxifen were mainly based on how poorly i did on birth control pills infertility drugs my hormones just like being messed with i have been on tamox for about 3 years a run down of the gyn issues caused me developed 2 fluid filled cysts cm cm both resolved on their own had surgery hysterectomy polypectomy d c twice when i developed polyps my lining became really thick i was also became very pmsy during these times the surgeries brought me relief from that as well my periods have mostly stopped but sometimes will break through this is no where near as poorly i did on birth control pills or infertility drugs hoping to hang in there for 2 more years i took tamoxifen for 3 months and already an insomniac it completely destroyed my sleep and left me with fatigue and concentration problems my primary care persuaded me to try effexor generic with a view to help me start back on the tamox i took it for 6 weeks and it is the worst thing i have ever taken i stopped it 3 weeks ago and am still getting side effects head buzzing fatigue and weakness in between the 2 pills i was going to the gym 3 times a week afterwards just laying in bed sleeping half the day when not working i just managed to get back to the gym once this week as i am so weak and need to try to get some strength back that i need for a short vacation in a few weeks that requires some hiking i have an appt with a new onc tomorow that my primary care wants me to see i will listen to what they have to say but i am not taking anything until after my vacation and have decided that i am just not prepared to ruin each day for something that may or may not happen if that makes any sense i am scared of having no life now due to the drugs that is just me i am turning into a bad patient i guess but i am 60 and just want to feel well enough to get on with life i would not recommend others do this and for those of us that have side effects i am sure there are many who do tolerate the anti hormonals well but i am just doing what i am comfortable with okay i will admit that iloved my first dom and wore it for ten weeks after my first surgery in nola the size been given has dropped each time had to wear one again and i once told dr d that i was going to keep coming back until i could wear the size small well i am done and quite get that far but did drop four sizes and feel good about that so spring can you put me down for jan 13th for a revision to the old umbilicus scar in the clinic local only and tattoos i finally read my operative report from october and dr d did do plication i thought so because had it before and when i woke up everything was so incredibly tight and sore still very tight but starting back up with my trainer on monday she knows to be gentle with me is anyone else experiencing frequent leg cramps at night been told the tamoxifen and i am long familiar with charley horse type calf cramps but i also getsome incredibly painful cramps in other places last night it was my inner thigh but also had them on the outside of my ankles the spasms are so intense that i cannot walk them off like a normal leg cramp sometimes when watching a movie if i merely move my foot the wrong way it will cramp and have to jump up out of my chair and stand hard on my toes i hope just the drug but between the cramps at night and the rolling spasms in my abdomen all day long my body is really trying to say something my last ac treatment is now under my belt i returned home and felt the worst i have felt on any treatment night barely moved from the couch went to bed early and felt fine the next morning now i am on day three and still had any side effects from this round odd i just keep on waiting for the other shoe to drop be starting taxol every other week on may 1st so see how that goes spent today at my soccer game and catching up on laundry why i say catching up i never caught before chemo and i have no idea why i think i will ever catch it now i gained any weight but am holding my breath since i understand the taxol could cause bloating i been on the elliptical since this last treatment but will get on tomorrow formygirls i spoke with a lady at the chemo lounge two weeks ago and she said that her palms had gotten very dirty she also had brown skin she called them her gorilla palms she had only one treatment to go and they were already lightening her oncologist told her that sometimesoccurred with people with darker skin looking forward to a positive week if it stays side effect free and then my little brother will be here for my next round always fun to have some out of town conversation until next time prayers for all dc mom shalimar if you all have questions please ask your throat may be sore fromsoft tissue irritation not necessarily the development of an actual illness you can order biotene from places like or and they can get it to you pretty fast particularly amazon just type biotene into the search bar i was able to find biotene products in my regular grocery your call on the kids especially if you think it would be helpful to them to understand the process and it would not scare be careful with the immodium and or constipation stuff unfortunately you have to go through the first tx to find out which products you will need unless you already know which tendency you normally have i had the big d after every tx i would have been in huge trouble with colace and prunes inever needed any of the products for constipation like ever i might also avoid visine taxotere will dry your eyes and the in visine will make that worse look for lubricating eyedrops it seems counterintuitive that dry eyes produce tearing but that is the case i never had heartburn so need tums but if you are prone to that normally you might mints might be an issue also mint flavoring burns as does mint toothpaste so if you are having heartburn this will make it worse hard candies like fruit or butterscotch might be better i wish i had bought stock in aquaphor i used a bunch of it i put it at the corners of my eyes and under my eyes because taxotere causesinvoluntary tearing and the salt from my tears irritated the skin i used to put it up my nose i know tmi again but my nose cracked and bled inside and this really helped it also helped because you will lose all your nose hair nothing to stop a runny nose and the aquaphor slowed it down so also keep tissues handy preferably the type with lotion the longer i went into tx i also had cracking at the edges of my fingernails and on my feet i slept with aquaphor slathered on my hands and feet and wore cottonsocks and gloves that helped a lot after a while i was just putting aquaphor everywhere lol jhodro i am glad to hear about the fluid in your ears i mean i am not glad for you but it explains mine i will have 8 taxol tomorrow i am wondering if some of my lost if taste and nasty taste could be a yeast infection or thrush sure not just wishful thinking that i could get rid of it that easy is a wonderful drug it works very well for nausea did they mention that you will get zofran and a steroid in your infusion the steroid will keep you awake the first night or 2 and then when you stop taking it you might crash and be really sleepy the good part about the steroids is that it keeps away allergies and helps with any aches and pains you may have i actually kind of miss my steroid buzz it also can make your face bright red the next day also did they tell you that you have to drink lots of water i think you are getting ac the c which is cytoxan can cause bladder problems if it get flushed out this is rare but easy enough to avoid interesting conversation about mammos and such i will be having a mammo on my remaining right breast then an mri on both i have some skin left from the mx the bs left skin to help with recon if i want it i asked my onc if i will just have an mri if i do recon and have the right breast removed too and he said then i need anything does this sound right i seen my bs since my after surgery and see him again unless there is a problem my onc schedules all my tests and such so there is no reason to see the bs i plan on seeing a ps soon to talk about recon i really want another surgery and not sure i like how the breasts look after recon but i want to be able to wear swimsuits and not have to worry that my top is too low all the time annoying i love following along with all the interesting conversations on this thread have a great day ladies this might sound strange but i am happy to see that others are having side effects on herceptin i sometimes think i am crazy cause the doctor keeps telling me there are no side effects on herceptin except for the serious ones like allergic reaction and or heart problems i did a c for every 3 weeks for 12 weeks then taxol herceptin once a week for 12 weeks and am now on herceptin only every 3 weeks for 52 weeks 16 infusions of the every 3 week regimen for 52 weeks i have completed 8 of them and have 8 more to go on the chemo and chemo herceptin regimens i lost my hair had fatigue and nausea however i did not have any bone joint pain on these regimens only some very short lived tingling in my hands and feet on occasion i had separation on the top part of my big toe nails but no finger nail issues with the exception of the first two herceptin only infusions where i did not experience any side effects i have had bone joint pain in my left elbow both hips and in my ankles and feet the pain in my left elbow borders on the severe at times at night my hands swell and become very stiff especially my left hand and it is not until i pump it a few times that it gets back to normal my doctor says these could be aresult of a loss of estrogen as the chemo did put me into early menopause however i have talked to my general practioner and older friends who have been through menopause and they all saidif these symptoms come frommenopausal changes they probably developed thisfast i have fatigue and seem to get as much done as i used to this the doctor says could be a lingering side effect of the chemo my nails split and i keep them cut short and i have found that it helps to use gloves for everything to do with water dish gloves for cleaning and latex gloves for cooking i experience some running nose but not to severe but i do get occasional bloody noses i feel like i have had changes in my hair except that the regrowth has seemed to slow down rather than experiencing any diarrhea i have experienced issues with constipation is this information going to be used to show the doctors that perhaps there are side effects to herceptin other than the serious ones i hope so i will tell my doctor about this site so she can if she wants see for herself that there must be something to my complaints rr reynolds thanks for this idea been on ai one month so far not bad i do have sleep stuff from post surgical discomfort and age related stuff and started to take melatonin hoping to circumvent any added ai se regarding sleep i never thought of using the tiredness as a plus i take my pill in the morning and just recently have been feeling totally wiped in the afternoon think i will see if changing the time will enhance my sleep that would be great welcome barbj your taxol neuropathy story is a bit scary glad the drugs have given you some relief hoping everyone is able to enjoy the rest of the weekend michelle soleil i start abraxane on tuesday reading the stats you posted on it and then the skidoo posted on faslodex i was surprised at those hoping the abraxane istruly working for you did you have nausea do you know the dosageyou were given lki honestly thought as farback asearly marchthat the faslodex working i had never had sore spotsonbones other than the left hip and it required rads i also had some pain in the area of the liver but it was stable on the scan china i know anything about gemzar know if a low grade fever can be a side effect of the drug i hope the nausea settles down for you though what are you using for the nausea painters are working on the inside of the house i started taking wallpaper down in our bathroom but that is when my arm startd bothering me so much and i finish i know what they used but it was not dif that i used but strong and went all over the house because our house is older and we have the popcorn ceilings he painted the ceiling in there with an oil based sealer andhe had to leave the bathroom 3 times he has sanded the walls patched sanded again patchedand friday he put a sealeron the walls andhe had to leave the bathroom 3 times as it is so strong and gives him a headache that onealong with painting some trim in the house sent us out of the house friday we are still gone tomorrow they are going to paint the rest of the trim and walls that be so bad i told him we were only going to do one more ceiling and that was a bedroom where we had a leak from one of the dormers needing caulking and he is going to do that while i am getting my abraxane we are using window fans to try to pull it out of the room but it is strong and i think it is probably good for me both my husband and i had sinus issues and was on antibiotics i hope it so bad when we get home tomorrow and they have painted trim and the walls it is late and i am falling asleep as i try to type hope this makes sense palady no one mentioned any thing being available to prevent this damage or the lifting taxotere does to the nail i wish i had used something anything my hands look terrible skin was also lifting on my hands my fingers were very sore for about a week what i fear is the nails will continue to lift for a while my nails had three deep lines across the nail one for each of the tx so i am assuming the same thing will be happening for the second round of chemo but the nails have not grown enough to see those lines from what read and heard form others this is not odd that it happened 4 months after the chemo but normal trinai lose my eyebrows until after i completed my chemo the hair on myhead fell off around day been a little over a month since my last chemo and i have no hair on my body anywhere not even an eyelash this has been a blessing relative to the hair under my arms as i am presently going thru the expander hell my armpitts are so swollen from the expanders it would be impossible to shave anne and suz thanks for the reply re mastectomy and pain after chemo what the onc said that it was the damaged nerves being messed with by the taxotere but i wanted to be sure if it was the chemo or if it was the bone stuff question does the pain or discomfort go away since the last infusion number three it has taken a lot longer for it to stop still tender around the edges i am so afraid that i would have this pain permanently i even considered cooling my chest during taxotere but then thought better of it as the chem would not reach the remains of breast tissue that might still have some bugs left suz yes winter is always a tough time to lose weight if you are inplace that has cold winters even here in california it gets pretty chilly during the day for a few months and days are short so not a whole lot of time is spent outdoors in one of your posts you mentioned swimming in the summer which was why you removed your picc a great exercise and this summer will get you back into fighting trim i personally wait until i am well past this last chemo so that i can get more physically active i am going to hop over to december rads because i want to know what to expect i am still fighting the idea i am supposed to get them for under my arm lymphadema

congratulations peggy on finishing what a long journey we have all been and the milestones are so personal this time of year tough to have to go through this people get busy with holiday stuff and here am i wishing i had the energy to chemo is depressing so much to think away from sick people conserve energy and ok next in this treatment schedule when will i feel normal anyone else get a bit jealous of what other folks seem to worry about think some depression is a normal response and i get tired of people saying you seem so positive when i know what a struggle it is some days sometimes i get the feeling if not positive failing and upsetting others i noticed the side effects have been a little more each time and boy am i looking forward to my last one next week just starting moving around today after 5 days of vicodin my vitual hugs to all who are feeling pain tonight anyone else on taxol having buzzing numbness and itching in feet am wondering when this will go away so i made an appt with an acupuncturist for after the last tx with my approval hoping be able to ski someday again aussie mom i am very impressed by your activism while going through are an inspiration enjoy your events this month my son went to germany for a exchange in high school and it was a life changing experience he matured so much calico i have the pain in the same spot and i was thinking it might be ovaries too going to ask i my onc the next time doing genetic evaluation this week for the bc grandma my mom and now me would do anything to spare my daughters this has anyone done the test decided since this diagnosis ruined my vacation plans last august i let it happen again so am making plans to take my kids to mexico the day after school is to june and feeling great again lisa hello ladies i just had my second round of tch and so far it is much easier that the first round the dose was lowered due to high liver enzymes i soaked my nails in ice and sucked on ice chips during taxotere and my mouth feels sooooo much better this time around the neulasta shot it seems makes my ribs hurt and causes my expanders to feel like they want to burst out of my chest it is an awful feeling but valium helps relax those muscles volleymom just want to send a hug to you and hope you are feeling better i have four more rounds to go i got a rash during carboplatin and they stopped it and gave me a benedryl steriod mix and restarted the dr said she may change the carboplatin to another med if needed the rash came back yesterday and i took benedryl and it cleared up i am also soaking in epsom salts to boost my magnesium and help my liver detox once a day i was on tamoxifen for 3 years i had a burst of weight gain in the first quarter some sleep disturbance some hot flashes and discharge which abated and then nothing went off after the bleeding in oct and started arimidex in nov have some hair thinning at least i am pretty sure i do but nothing else thought i had some aches but not really and had some hand numbness which i did not connect to it but googled it and found that many women complain of that on this drug but then it went away so now six months in i would say no ses except for the hair thinning and i think i generally look older but hey i am older so maybe that is not due to the ai i tend to both underreact to drugs in general and physical things i tend to not pay attention and dismiss things unless they are major so maybe not a good one to report on this i also take dim you can google it which is supposed to help with estrogen related issues while not being estrogenic itself so maybe that helps me i know re my ex still in psych ward daughters at various levels of devestation family in total upheavel i cannot believe this on a happy note i went to my high school play yesterday the sound of music she had the main part it was a lovely respite i thoroughly enjoyed it although after 3 hours in that uncomfortable seat i was hurting and am hurting today but it was i think worth it and finally spring is definitely here buds on trees rebirth hope very healing i am hoping to spend more time outside even just sitting still and enjoying it love to all ladies i have been on tamoxifen for years and the have been so severe the past 2 months that today i stopped taking tamox felt like i running a fever for 2 months when i take my temp tho it is below i feel sick pounding headaches daily no energy weight gain trouble sleeping overall lethargy sproradic and random pain all over my body nausea intense hot flashes even more than usual tammi hot flashes my onco wants to switch me to ai in october i am taking a tammi break until then i was wondering if other women have experienced worsening after taking tammi for a couple of years thank you i was on tamoxifen for 7 years back in the 1980 s and have now been on arimidex for 1 year here are symptoms i experienced very unscientific and anecdotal tamoxifen fatigue loss of libido i was only 33 then so that was very noticeable weight gain arimidex neck pain muscle aches fatigue fatigue the first month only decreased vitamin d level from 40 to 25 about 9 months after starting arimidex i am now on 5000 iu vit d per endocrinologist and neck pain and muscle aches are much better none of the above is anywhere near as bad as chemo and definitely better than breast cancer helloyes also experienced and it is still black both the fingernails and toenails during chemotherapy my oncologist said that there are chances of nails developing black lines on the nails i thought that as my chemo ends the nails will quickly recover and get my beautiful clear nails back but unfortunately i sometimes more than difficult to stay patient slowly the blackness is fading away of the fingernails and from the bottom going to the top as the nail keeps on growing though slow growth but my toenails no positive change still black i had first four drips of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide then other four drips of taxol paclitaxel the first two in my guess was the cause of blackening nails please the ones who are reading can you please suggest some care tips which has worked wonders for you in this situation heard some supplements for nails skin hair are available to improve the condition but know how much true and beneficial it is and is this blackening a permanent hope not would be nice if some light is shed on this thanks just got back an hour ago from a long day infusion oncologist visit then chemo this doc is very informative very supportive i told her how so many of you have been put on b vitamins to prevent heal fingertip neuropathy from taxotere the supervising oncologist i met before my first chemo round said take it no firm eveidencem best not to take anything unnecessary this new doc said take it it is becoming standard is the us and parts of europe but finland is lagging behind she also ordered a cold glove for my right hand left had iv so but i am right handed anyway said the numbness i already have from the first dose may or may not worsen or heal but we can only wait and see the awful headaches are from taxotere only nothing more serious and i just have to take the pain meds and the foggy thinking she said oh just taxotere brain wtf and should gradually go away over several weeks months after my third and last dose in three weeks this time the nurse different one got the iv in first shot that made the whole day so very much more bearable also when i told her about the vein burning last time she said which one and said it was way too small for taxotere put the iv into a larger one and made sure the saline carrier bag never ran dry little pleasures yes the taxotere started that headache but i am adulting better about it better now sorry babbling right now but sort of high on the steroids plus the really strong pain med just wanted to reassure that the second chemo dose always worse than the first know yet about side effects but not worrying tonight this time i will try no to overdo during the worst of the side effects welcome to all you newcomers and wishing everybody an easier weekend tomorrow is a c treatment 3 we moved it up

hospital when they use either arm yes it is always higher in leg vs arm takes a lot more force to pump blood to lower extremities father distance so bp is higher but i know what a normal leg bp should be dean 15 i had some ankle swelling after round 1 from taxotere gone away but now i get swelling of my eyelids each pretty i usually notice it until the second week out this week for me and it lasts a few days trina i so know how you feel everyone keeps telling me one more to go and then done like over that day yes happy be done with chemo next week but right only part of it be weeks after that

from my first ac the worst moment so far has been the infusion itself the anti nausea caused some kind of itchy feeling all over my body and the first med cytoxan i think gave me a headache iv was painfull so i might get the port for next round only had quizzyness the first night went away with medication and i feel tired but manageable on the node chemo theme in a very similar situation since 34 one micro met mm and had oncotype as it needed having chemo for sure because of your age like i said before they also did full axillary dissection for the same reason i agreed with chemo the alnd not so sure since talking arm problems and physical therapy maybe for life allready doing it i had something unusual i had swollen retroperitoneal lymph nodes why i had a pet scan but showed nothing i might post a new thread asking people about this since curious about it i had severe joint pain from zometa i was also switched to aredia i do not notice an increase in joint pain when i get the aredia however since i have been on tamoxifen and more recently ais i have had a huge increase in bone and joint pain mine is my ankles primarily but also my hips if i sit for long periods of time in addition to calcium i take vitamin c fish oil and boswellia which help but i noticed as the weather changes it is indeed worse jennifer hi ladiesonc wants to switch me to armidex or its generic i am now on tamoxifen but am in menopause what are some of the ses and should i make this switch i want any more joint pain than i have now any comments appreciated thanks good evening ladies actually had a nice day here my younger daughter had her 18th birthday party this afternoon about 15 kids came over for movies and cake it was nice joni i showed her what you said about april born girls being

11 weekend is a for me i may be out of town with my dh on business and know for awhile sounds like danny is going to be okay although i agree with you about that 6 floor walk up arrangement viddie amera yes i agree about the the chemo effects being accumulative this taxotere has really knocked me out tush rash bladder infection really tired mary does not sound like a great day for you i hope ken your bil will be okay you work in troy anywhere near the somerset mall i have a ton of relatives in the southfield and west bloomfield hills areas and we have stayed in troy for some weddings and bar mitzvahs skye how was your first herceptin any reactions i will probably be having my first one sometime in early mid june did you have a muga or echo recently i had a muga in november before my mastectomy it was fine i know the actual level but i will ask next time my onc said he will do another one after chemo before herceptin jan where in toronto does your aunt live i am in thornhill just north of the willowdale area tomorrow morning i have an appointment with a big gyn onc to talk about taking out my ovaries anyone else done or doing this i had a hysterctomy 3 years ago took out my uterus and did a bladder lift left in the ovaries my mother begged me at the time to take them out but my gyn and i decided to leave them in as i was only 45 at the time and she said i could still be 5 7 years away from menopause and the estrogen was good for me so of course here i am with highly er 90 bc i guess i should have listened to my mother hope everyone else is having a quiet evening caya daysone this neuropathy stuff is weird some days worse than others and some nights i even sleep because my feet are so hot sensitive takingtamoxifen and onc told me to take vitamin e which might help with hot flashes i have heard some drs prescribe effexor for that so if vitamin e help gonna be calling office chynnadollsmom wow i heard of rheumatism but right that sounds very much like what experiencing i get out of bed in the morning and have to shuffle til my body warms up glad feeling better and sure do hope mine eases some soon my job requires a lot of movement and discovered that if i kneel down real hard to stand back up forget about graceful i have lost 3 pounds since been back this week yay do you have any tips for me maybe you did something to help your symtoms ease sooner sugar my right eye twitched with the watering i think people thought i was winking maybe the twitching watering is all related dunno but the claritin i am taking has helped i have watering or twitching any more lynda i had taxotere adriamycin and cytoxan followed by neulasta i also had headaches after my first treatment but they slowed down the cytoxan drip for the second treatment and the headaches were much better they also gave me compazine for nausea for the second treatment i switched to emend which was better definitely tell you onc and nurses about your side effects they may be able to make adjustments to help you to feel better best of luck mike words of wisdom not sure but i can share my experiences i am 9 months post chemo 4 rounds of ac followed by 12 rounds of taxol for me the lasting effects of the taxol have been brutal i am still dealing with a significant amount of neuropathy i continued to exercise jogging short paces during my whole entire chemo regimen my neighbors got use to seeing me bald crying and puking on the side of the road needless to say it a good look but i was given the advice that it would prevent the neuropathyfrom becoming permanent i have such severe joint pain that if it is cold i can not get out of bed my face and nose tingle constantly i finally gave in and started taking a lose dose of cymbalta it is helping somewhat i am triple negative rumor has it that we are hit the hardest with everything so who knows my dr has told me that it will take a full year to recover from the chemo so i should remain optimistic hope this helps hi everyone new to these boards and so glad to have found this forum i finished herceptin january 29 almost 6 weeks ago i was in the aphinity trial so also may have been getting pertuzimab perjeta or a placebo i did acth starting herceptin and possibly perjeta with taxol also on tamoxifen sometimes not sure which se are due to tamoxifen herceptin or chemo or radiation leftovers or even reconstruction side effects have included slow hair growth though thick weak nails redness around nails runny nose general muscle cramps often when doing yoga low tsh lessened stamina in the fall when i started running again i felt i could not progress so i took a break and do yoga and walk but the weirdest thing is itchy skin during herceptin i would get itchy sometimes in the week after treatment but now that stopped herceptin and maybe perjeta the itching has gotten worse itching in arms radiated area legs even scalp and wondering if it could be some kind of withdrawal reaction it has been very dry because of the cold and taxol was also rough on my poor skin so it could just be coincidence but i am wondering if there are withdrawal effects when coming off these drugs not on a trial but am having had second epi of four last friday will have cmf on day 1 and day 8 of the month for four months after the epi and rads after all the chemo i have a port in my chest so no bruised veins highly recommend it i used the cold cap each time the neoprene cap out of the freezer not the type i even think it felt especially cold certainly not uncomfortable my hair is thick cut it to collar length before starting chemo and it still looks fairly normal only washing it twice a week which i hate but not going out so who cares i comb it when i get up a handful comes out in the comb more when wet and i touch it otherwise it falling and stays there unless pulled by hand or by comb certainly thinning but only i would notice that i was told it works for half the patients that try it with epi but work with tax had no sickness or nausea at all just sleepy in the afternoons and omeprazole works for heartburn lyn xxx hi everyone welcome to all of our newcomers we are happy to have you join the conversation i have good news to report finally i feel like i have turned a corner in the last 7 days or so the fatigue that has been so indescribably dibilitating has begun to subside i attribute most of that to time i am now 6 weeks pfr but i also got serious about exercise i am now doing a very strong miles on varying inclines mostly 7 in 30 minutes on the treadmill i was walking outside but the concrete was much harder on my joints so back on the treadmill i am doing this 6 days a week and after a month i started really slow finally feeling stronger i gained 10 lbs in my first 21 days on tamoxifen without making any other changes with my newfound consistency on exercise and a much more disciplined diet down 5 of those 10 pounds again in just the last week and a half my emotions still run a little wild but overall i am much more even keel too sharing all of this to say hang in there for those of you feeling the of tamox and to those just getting started we do still have some level of control diet and exercise matter but let it be a heavy thing on you do what you can when you can i started super slow and set very small very manageable goals still on the treadmil when i want to quit i tell myself i can do i can do anything for one more minute san i have been on tamoxifen for 2 months it is due to my for lobular breast cancer i have had 2 bouts of gastric cancer and found out my genetic mutation is estrogen receptor positive so recommended to take the tamoxifen i have had devilish hot flashes worse than when i had my hystrectomy in 98 but i am encouraged by the fact that if i have the hot flashes they say its working the way its supposed to go figure other than that i am ok oh and i usually blow my hair straight and now i have to let it go curly actually never was this curly since i get so drenched several times a day hi everyone i am a cold cap user caps designed by edward stout i have had one chemo treatment ac x 4 then taxol x 12 weekly then lumpectomy then radiation it is day 13 and so far no hair loss anywhere maybe too early but i am thinking positively i chose the caps because i thought the fit would be better and it does fit tightly over the head i will let you know how it goes as my treatment continues i was given a rx for latisse but i have blue eyes and hesitate to chance turning them brown i am very curious how often that happens one woman where i am taking my treatments told me that she uses the latisse al lot of the women there do and to save money she bought a small thin brush because the one that comes with the latisse is so big and her latisse lasts her about three months so the walmart is cut in third imay try it and will let you know oh the lashes are in good shape and long she never lost hers but she said they did thin out some but the latisse has lengthened her lashes even longer than before chemo sje had light green eyes and she said the color did not change loreal lashboosting serum i bought andused this on my lashes before i knew i had cancer and i definitely did feel it worked well enough to buy it two more times i like it and fell like it does condition and keep my lashes from being too dry there is a mascara that goes along with it i buy it at walgreens for about you can buy the serum for about and the mascara with the serum in it for about usually you can buy one get one half off at walgreens i stopped using it when i found out about the cancer duh i am taking large amounts of vitamins especially vit d which i am low in as are most cancer patients i do cut all but the vitamin d out iu daily two days before chemo and start up again two days after i alsoam usingvitamin d to rub on the scar i have from my port and it does look very good but the rubbing of the scar is what really flattens it out you need to rub your scars for at least two months a few times a day vitamin e can actually toughen and sometimes thickenscars so i use it only internally any oil or petroleum jelly works well on scars but i prefer vit d and petroleum jelly next so my fingers can glide over the scar i concentrate on any high spot on the scar while rubbing over the whole scar in many directions diagnosed july 2010 idcstage ii grade ii tumorsize cm er her 2 treatments ac x 4 taxol x 12 weekly then lumpectomy then radiationtreatments so far chemo 1 of 8 ac worst side effect for me so far nausearegrets that i allowed my family and doctor to convince me to install the port yes i know it is easier i just wish i i just thiought i would add this information in case it helps someone all my best so nice to hear from others going through these same struggles we know we are not alone we are strong to handle all this i did wish this past year away and i have 3 teenagers and hate to see the time fly by but was so ready to just get it behind me it went by really fast too i had the red chemotherapy first it was the worst part i ended with taxol i never got sick one time the meds they have now are amazing i was tired but never to sick i remember the time when you know anything is the worst it so much better when they get a plan for you and a goal best wishes to both of you i gained some weight with chemotherapy and trying hard to loose more i am watching what eating no alcohol very little meat fish i drink green tea broccoli and soy milk which all have antioxidants and are supposed to be helpful also exercising almost daily i agree very important to be healthy a change and a new lifestyle for sure i just wanted to visit with others that are dealing with the same type of situation and i appreciate it we have the advantage of being able to take tamoxifen go away cancer we are stronger than you hi all only taking tamoxifen plus drugs for the acid reflux 20mg omeprazole and 10mg of domperidone 3 to 4 times a day i really know if omeprazole is doing a thing as i have the vomiting attacks when taking it not all the time thankfully but usually two or three times a month completely washed out the next day though i do have an acid taste often through the day but certainly badly in the morning even suffered tooth decay from it really rapidly yesterday i bought some slippery elm tablets from the health food shop know if help or hinder trying stopping the other things possibly a mad thing to do but keep taking tablets that working seems mad too i think the domperidone does help quite a lot but i gather you stay on them bw elinda at first diagnosis i had mets to my gi tract not sure where exactly my pet scan lit up like a christmas tree i had severe stomach cramps diarrhea vomiting etc i was on gemzar chermo and tamoxifen i lost so much weitght that i had a pic put in my arm and did iv nutrition at night the gemzar do much but at abput 12 weeks the tamox kicked in and my markers moved downward since then i have had improvement and had the pic line removed over a year ago then the tamox failed last june and i was put on femara it worked until last month and my markers creeped upward so we have a pet scan scheduled to see what is going on i cannot eat gluten i have known that for several years i limit dairy i try to eat small meals and usually the largest is at lunch otherwise i just feel bloated if i eat too much at dinner i still struggle with stomach cramps something will set them on and i can have them for a day or two and then they go away it totatlly freaks me out i immediately go back to first diagnosis when i was in the er with severe cramping that is how i was diagnosed my onc just said once an organ is damaged if often just never quite gets back to normal but i am so much better i would be happy if things could just continue on like this for a few more months ir years lyrica helped immensely with joint muscle pain from the femara letrozole i tried gabapentin first because my insurance preferred it but the lyrica is so much better hugs to you all mckatherine so great to get to see your face if you choose to just have the cyst removed to see if benign or whatever have you thought about having your ovaries chemically ablated i know you mentioned that you are terrified of lupron but there is another option which is zoladex i am currently on zoladex injections to shut the ol estrogen makers down and i can honestly tell you that the side effects have been extremely minimal hot flashes skin is a little more dry i have only been on if for a couple of months so i suppose worse things could be in store but for now fine i know two other girls in my age range on it and they are also fine in addition to the zoladex i am also on tamoxifen sometimes even if a woman has ovary removal a doc keeps her on tamox instead of switching to an ai for the protective benefits bone heart mental functions especially if she is young and was no where near natural menopause just something to think about no ovaries does not necessarily equate to no tamoxifen i think that maybe they meant all the fun hot flashes that come with taking tamoxifen all the ladies in my support group who have taken it say the hot flashes are sometimes unbearable welcome to our little group i have had three infusions and this last one last week was very different then the first two did you get neulasta shot for whites the day after chemo can make bones ache and i believe the lxempra also causes serve body aches my worst days are day then start to feel better takes days and then body is better i am not losing my hair coming back after 30 taxols and eye brows too be prepared with prune juice for constipation and imodium for the other stuff nsusea with this drug too day i believe lxempra to be effective but a bit tough my neuropathy had improved on lxempra compared to taxol taxol ruined my feet but now improving i think neuropathy is side effect of lxempra but not as intense as taxenes keep us posted hope you do well on the drug diana collerick welcome but sorry having to join us i had 6 cycles of taxotere carboplatin herceptin perjeta three weeks apart but someone else will probably chime in i am still having herceptin for a year but decided not to continue the perjeta since i was already suffering neuropathy from the taxotere a possible perjeta side effect you should probably post on one of the taxotere threads too or a fall 2014 chemo thread even if not getting the perjeta there will be lots of pertinent info good luck with your treatment and the ses i just learned that the organizers for the glow run in vegas cancelled the event this year this is the one the september 2013 chemo group was doing as part of our meet up in vegas to celebrate being done with treatment we are all really disappointed no explanation of why they cancelled it we are still getting together we just be doing the run oh well maybe next year hi daniellad i wish you the best of luck as you start chemo i found taxol to be very tolerable i had a little bit of neuropathy during treatment but otherwise have any major problems i hope you find it easy too and if you do i imagine why you be able to continue running i did not have herceptin so i know how people do on that all you disney runners good luck and have fun happy belated birthday sweethope i actually went to get my head shaved today lol because not all of it fell out during the ac phase i had longer pieces mixed with shorter and the entire this just looked scruffy to me now i am all the same length all over and since i have a scalp again it should grow better i hope can relate to not really knowing what colour your hair is mine i think has finally decided to be red again but it is hard to tell when it is short is almost white but not hair reflects light instead of absorbing it is almost invisible in the light but as it grew some it darkened down some of the strands seemed to have two colours on pre one post ac now that i have it shaved short again it seems like it is going to be red again all over in about a month i hope to be able to tell for sure to hear about the neurapathy knock on wood i have mostly ok so far although on treatment days everything goes all feet and face mostly i feel the reduced sensation in my hands i am starting to get some bad swelling though especially around my right ankle and foot and that is starting to cause pain anyone else feel felt like they were carrying around 25 lbs of extra water while on taxol i usually feel bloated the first couple days after treatment and night of but this time it is almost constant jenn fizzdon yes tamoxofin can cause hot flashes i think just about anyone who takes it gets these effexor has been prescribed to help counteract these but work for me only made it worse i using it for the hot flashes though i am depressed and they tried it for that tamoxifen also can be linked to depression lexapro works better for me my oncologist says tumeric helps also i have some great news my scan yesterday showed significant shrinkage in the tumors in my liver after 3 cycles of kadcyla needless to say thrilled this drug so far is very easy for me the main side effect is fatigue but nothing like when i was on taxotere plus my hair is growing like crazy going to assume that the cramps spasms been having actually are the result of the chemo destroying the cancer cells woo hoo all the best to everyone hugs trish glad to find this thread i have been on tamoxifen for years for the last years been working out with a personal trainer and walking miles a week during the summers also swimming i have not been able to lose weight and during the six months after my bilateral mastectomy my blood pressure was going up 10 points per month i was on benazapril but recently read that it increases the risk of bc recurrence by 77 so i have stopped taking it losing weight is the safest way for me to lower my bp but i do think tamoxifen is making it impossible for me unless you call pound per month a success i never had chemo and did have a full hysterectomy years ago after reading last night that tamoxifen does cause liver issues and studies showed more adipose belly fat in those taking it i am going to stop for a few weeks i have pain but also have scoliosis and am not sure if i can blame any joint pain on the medication i think my risks of problems from being overweight are greater than my risk of recurrence at this point plus my surgical oncologist told me that having had a hysterectomy in my situation studies in europe showed that to be just as effective all very confusing and worrisome but i need to see if i can shed some weight by pausing the tamoxifen for a few weeks or more i did not receive on oncotype score my cancer was 7mm idc no nodes grade not happy about the grade but i am also not happy about taking a drug that is not exactly without problems of its own i see my onc for a six month check this coming friday and will inform him that taking a break for a few weeks he be happy but i am not happy in my situation either karen the adriamycin day 3 nausea vomiting but i must qualify all of this i had just finished a course of carboplatin and 5fu for colorectal cancer 6 months before this i truly believe that i reacted strongly because i had not completely come out of that one i had a gal sitting next to me doing the same course and she had no troubles more major that a slightly queasy stomach of course as i said my hair fell out right on schedule 20 days after the first infusion my best advice is what i learned the hard way water i drank still do at least 2 quarts a day especially during the infusion time i am now 6 months out from the chemo 3 months out from rads i have no lingering sides except from rads i have intermittant bone pain in the radiated area i was stage iib sentinel nodes were involved thanks for the info hugs kathi congrats to all who are finishing finished you made it time for whatever your next steps may be my legs feel heavy on the taxol too just walking up the stairs feels like i have done squats or lunges all day they are shaky by stair guess that is why handrails were invented the extra 10 pounds i have gained is not going to come off anytime soon every time i put on shoes sometimes just standing up brings on the stupid neuropathy i just keep saying when the chemo is done i did not have dcis but i did have a very low oncotype score initially when i tried tamoxifen i started celexa a day earlier i had some pretty severe side effects but i know now that at least some of them were from the celexa i did not take t for a year i tell you the worse forme of not taking tamoxifen was knowing that i had not done all i could to prevent a recurrence a year after dx i tried tamoxifen again but i did not make any change to my antidepressant because i know if i could do t i was on 40 mg prozac amazingly i had few side effects mainly night sweats that have improved greatly after i was settled in the tamoxifen about 10 days my onco put me on mg of effexor for hot flashes and depression it has worked out well i agree that it hurt to try and you might be surprised edited to add often times after active treatment ends our emotions take a nose dive ptsd you might want to delay trying tamoxifen if and when you decide to try it until you feel really strong and any possible signs of pts are gone or at least recognizable also i think lexapro is ok to use with tamoxifen check with the doc on that thanks for the taxol update bow i have my first one next thursday and honestly it scares the bejesus out of me i know a c is supposed to be the tough cocktail and definitely ready for the nausea and fatigue to ease up but the thought of neuropathy in my hands and feet scares me has anyone going thru taxol tried icing their hands and feet yet i asked the nurses about it and they said they had only ever seen one person do it but i was welcome to try so far my nails have been good they actually are the longest and strongest ever been shockingly been painting them like a mad woman with sally hard as nails so maybe that has helped i have one teeny tiny purple spot at the base of my right thumb other than that they are awesome going to be super sad if taxol damages them i had blood drawn today and as expected counts were low rbcs are taking a beating the shortness of breath this cycle is killing me and i feel like nothing more than a lump on a log i agree with everyone else about getting into this funk about how crappy i feel all the time i actually got teary eyed okay i cried when i saw the nurses today after they drew my blood i can deal with the nausea and fatigue but these hot flashes are killing me i had one so bad this morning before my appointment that i thought i was going to pass out they gave me an rx for a drug to help with it but iw was too tired to get it filled today so be picking it up in the morning i hope it works thanks for answering you guys i was scared about the nails but glad not because of herceptin alone my nails were okay with taxol whew and done with that i have an appointment with my oncologist tomorrow and my herceptin every 3 weeks i hope i get the running nose i had that with taxol for 3 months i hated it made you tired all the time back at the gym these days slowly but surely take care myra awww sweet sue you avatar looks so awesome by the way its good to hear from you how was minnesota you betcha have you ever seen the movie fargo lol its funny but yet sick anyway the accent is so my family okay on to a more important topic i heard that tamoxifen can have an effect on your menstrual cycle by i believe 25 however you definitely should be seen if you have abnormal bleeding irregular menstrual periods or pain make certain you see your obgyn for regular check ups too maybeyour pain is due to anurinary track infection the good news is you been on it for that long so jump to conclusions okay i will say a special prayer for you tonight congratulations on your awesome results mamo i cried too then i got bawled out by my bs that i due for another 4 monthsin any event i am happy to hear the good news keep us posted w more much luv xo back good morning ladies i had treatment 4 yesterday only 2 more to go sure hope they figure out going on sometimes your heart rate goes up with fever or dehydration i hope the muga scan results are ok and i agree that you should have a chest xray with sats that low keeping my fingers crossed for you melissa i wanted to comment that your profile pic is beautiful for all the ladies beginning taxotere i can tell you that i have used a nail strengthener that is clear sporadically and my nails have been fine they do get a bit sore anddark after treatment but that is more the nail bed than my nails my said that it caused her to have horizontal lines each treatment but never turned black or fell off as for eyebrows lashes my eyebrows are fine although i have really thick eyebrows and could stand to lose some of them and my lashes are a bit still there hopefully i just jinx myself i get taxoterewith carboplatin so i tell you correctly what to expect with just taxotere i did have nausea yesterday when my taxotere was running and that was a first i get taxotere then carboplatin and then herceptin so i know i gotten anything but my premeds which includes 4 things that can help with nausea she slowed the taxotere down and that seemed to help along with sipping since it was the first time this has happened i tried to think of what was different and i had only a couple pieces of lunchmeat before my appt i usually have more on my stomach going to treatment to include dry things like toast hope this helps someone commented that they were getting ready to face the wave of post chemo crap i thought that was a very good way to put it besides being a fl native and loving the beach it really fits this stuff you hit this wave you have to work through and then you get back to the point of treading water trying to save up your energybefore youget smacked by another wave i guess if you think of it that way no wonder tired hopefully when this is all done pull ourselves up onto the beach in a comfortable chair with a good book in one hand and a margarita in the other just watching the waves maybe then be able to appreciate them i hope everyone is well today i get my neulasta today tried getting out of them or the dose reduced but mon my were and i was running a low grade temp so getting ready to get smacked by thebig kahunatomorrow i did get cleared to take advil yay and gonna try allegra since the claritin work love and strength to everyone andrea i had 4xac and then 4xtaxol i had some aches during taxol took percocet at night to sleep through them my hair started to grow back after my 2nd treatment alittle neuropathy but nothing too bad and it last long take care hello everyone i post often but i do read frequently and have found this site so very helpful i switched to arimidex 4 months ago after being on tamoxifen for almost three years i was confirmed as being and my onc made the switch as we have all heard that an ai is the preferred choice for post menopausal women i had zero aes on tamoxifen after four months of arimidex my joints ache which i am trying to tolerate even though i am a runner the pain has hampered my running but i can still exercise and i can and live with it i have gained about 8 lbs which i am desperately trying to shed which literally came on overnight again something i can live with now the hair loss it is destroying me i am shedding more than my dog and am now developing severe thin areas along my part line on the top of my head i am taking biotin and using nioxin which i started in july but feel are not helping at all i went thru chemo so i know what it is like to not have any hair i bear this again my hair grew back beautifully after chemo but now i feel that i am heading towards a situation where eventually a wig or a scarf may be my only solution does anyone have any experience with switching to another the hair loss stop or at least slow down or i am pretty much doomed to hair loss no matter which ai i am taking does anyone have any advice does minoxidil work is it safe as you can tell i am extremely upset and just know what to do i stop the ai for hair loss because with a stage 3 diagnosis i need to do all i can to prevent the beast from coming back i would be grateful for any help or suggestions that anyone may have having a really bad day today been off it for 5 months and had no real although i have many while on it so that may determine how your body reacts to withdrawal i had some leg cramps and felt like i was getting my period which i get and a few headaches here and there i just had my ovaries out 4 weeks ago to start taking femara and have been on that for 3 weeks with a few like leg cramps and headaches so obviously this is effecting me like my normal pms used to be nothing major i had some hair thinning on tamoxifen and now notice a lot of little hairs starting to grow again so hopefully i start losing hair again because of the operation and meds fifty menopausal taking tamoxifen since january 2006 and my anxiety is all post traumatic so i take an ativan one in the morning in the afternoon and at bedtime to help me sleep perimenopause was the cause of my sleepless nights prior to breast cancer and then menopause and the stress from breast cancer led to more sleepless nights i am slowly backing off my ativan but i do not hesitate to take a tablet when i feel the anxiety or obsessive thoughts coming on it is the only thing that makes me feel somewhat normal and i need that crutch right now since i had to give up drinking love terry i been on this thread much lately so been able to keep up with everything welcome to all the newbies in ibranceland and hoping that you all achieve regression with minimal side effects for me it has been a fairly easy combo to tolerate the supplements that i take have really helped tomanage the low blood counts i have also been taking some which help with the joint stiffnes from the femara i would encourage the newbies to read theposts from several months ago regarding the supplements to help with the low blood counts that bothmyra and i have posted patty glad to see you here andso happy that you have recovered from your time in the hospital praying for you to get good results my onc has one patient who was very advavanced alsoand tolerate the side effects of ibrance he seems to feel that ifthe bone mets have greatly impacted the bone marrow that it is more difficult for your counts to rebound not sure about that but it makes sense she was also not able to tolerate the ibrance as your oncs patients could not myra mallory isbeautiful congratulations what a joy praying for you to have lower tms also julie i see that been on most of the oral chemos so i suppose that the iv chemos are next have not had doxil but did have high dose act when diagnosed in 1997 had abraxane which wasnot difficult other than hair loss my onc says you can give that again after a year so that is still an option for the future in my situation since not had faslodex my onc plans on giving faslodex ibrance when the faslodex femara stops working would that be an option for you so far so good for me in ibranceland i actually had a small rise in my tms initially but then they have come down to slightly below where they were when i first started the combo back in for me the tms have always been very reliable my onc also does things very diffently than other drs and gives the ctc test myra and stephanie is your onc planning on switching from ibrance without scanning again if tms continue to rise have a great day everyone very hot here in nyc today dorothy has anyone any experience of this i was recommended to try acupuncture by someone who found it had really helped her with menopausal hot flushes and night sweats and after over two years on arimidex i am getting increasingly fed up with these particularly the night sweats and seriously disturbed sleep only had one treatment so far and no difference but i was impressed by the therapist and am intending to stay for a whole course 6 treatments i think has anyone else tried this and did it help i am taking weekly taxol have number 8 coming up tuesday no nausea no vomiting dry mouth still get mouth sores if i forget to suck on ice the infusion of taxol seems longer than the a c was i get incredible bone pain from days comes on suddenly and is gone just as suddenly i was told no ibuprofen so started with tylenol but no relief from that was moved to vicodin which helped but not a lot and finally was given percocet but all in all things have been so much better on taxol i have not had a neulasta shot since my final a c so must have something to do with the amount given or maybe i just have white counts that are normal now kathy deanna and gail taxotere is known to cause water retention see i also feel bloated and overfed if i eat an amount that i normally would i would wait at least a week after tx to see what your end weight is the hot flashes are definitely annoying the first week or 10 days after tx i wake up every 2 hrs or so too welcome kimy and i hope it went well today lani i found personally that my thyroid went haywire during chemo and has been on a slow and often interrupted recovery ever since look up over at chemodrug site and see if cisplatin lists thyroid issues update found this site talking about thyroid i went on a low doseage of the natural thyroid and it has helped to moderate my thyroid i can now tell when it starts to slide into hypothyroidism i start to gain pounds a week and get very sleep i have learned that when it comes to the thyroid and our glands that there is really no pill you can take and see a result overnight adjustments and clarity seem to take time and certainly tax our patience on the report i can offer no expertise in the evaluation to help perhaps someone else will come on to help out sorry what i do know is that often when going through treatment other things crop up and always important to do exactly what happened here and that is to know your own body well so that you discover things that are new and then thoroughly evaluate them right away it can make one feel like a super sleuth and certainly paranoid about every little thing but then again eventually you realize that a good thing to be a sleuth that finds these things last week of february welcome to the new comers looks like we have quite a few starting chemo this week you can do it if i could offer three key things that helped me through the first treatment 1 drink lots of fluid 2 ask take medicatioin as prescribed and 3 exercise while you can sometimes even if your body does not feel like it will yourself to do just some walking the way i look at it chemo drugs are toxins that enter our body to blast at all fast growing cells cancer included my job is to get it out of my system as much as i can to help my liver kidney etc etc to this purpose drinking fluids helps but so does sweating not to the point of exercising yourself to exhaustion but working up some sweat gave mea better feeling all around particularly a better appetitie every time taking in nutrients is key today is my first day at work with my wig very light and airy the brand is called and i like it quite a bit and no one noticed the difference not even my girls who are very particular about hair for those who recently joined one of the first ones to go through treatment this month was my first tc before the treatment the nurse told me all about the drugs and said taxotere sometimes just thins hair but cytoxan is ruthless my takeaway my hair has no chance nothing happened until day 14 when just a few strands came off which was last wednesday i had two good days of just strandslast thursday and friday for me to be comfortable at work but friday night and saturday my hair had a major exodus suffice itto say by sunday night i was left with perhaps 1 of my hair this morning in the bathroom with the lights on i told my husband that if i took my wig off now the room would be twice as bright totally bald now but the wig feels so much better on saturday and sunday when i wore my wig slight adjustment would make the few strands left hurt my scalp now i no longer have to worry about picking up hair everywhere and it really feels pretty good but it feels cold my husband stayed strong all through the surgery and chemo for me but boy he has a hard time seeing my hair go so not let him see my hair scalp after saturday morning i love my wig just ordered two sleep caps from i have a few hats and caps from the donation web site forgot the name now sent to me for free but i really like the color style morning all from a chilly new zealand winter has arrived but we do have a beautiful day it was almost a frost this morning we get too many in auckland where as the do further south beginning to recover from the final taxol but still have bone pain my poor arm and shoulder after radiation simulation this morning i could hardly move when they said i could put my arms down twink i have numb toes vitually no feeling at all as well as numbness in my fingers which makes opening jars etc very difficult dr said to be very careful with my feet as it is very easy to hurt them and not realise what you have done also loved your menu it sounded really wonderful we had salmon last night but it was farmed salmon still quite nice i put my cranberry chutney on the top and poached it in a little wine very nice cahterine i have a pot of daffodils in my kitchen a friend gave them to me a couple of weeks ago so in a few days they will make a lovely splash of colour you talk about roses blooming i am thinking about pruning mine very soon belinda i lost my eyebrows recently really thought i was going to keep them but they too went have a few eyelashes left but not many to speak of i am not sure about the fuzz which i have all over my head i have the feeling that it is about to go question what is the weather temperature like in indiana and pennsylvania in september and october how many hours of daylight at that time of the year we had been planning a trip next year but think it would make more sense to do it later this year have friends in indiana and an aunt in pennsylvania so want to visit them hope everyone has a great day and that they feel stronger all the time alyson i had a uni mastectomy on right side for dcis 10 i tried tamoxifen and it made me feel really depressed where i already have a problem with depression and am on medication for it my doctor felt o k for me not to take it quality of life is important too good morning everyone yesterday went well having some discomfort today so im still taking the pain meds but im cutting the pills in half and plan to only take them as needed that seems to be working well hey leah i asked for extra numbing too and told them the flaming boob story one of the nurses had been thru both procedures and like you said i dont know if they gave me extra lidocain or not but i didnt feel a thing i had to go to a different hospital than where i had the snb done and this one has a breast center wing that could have been the difference too alyson thanks so much for your kind words and i agree with you about the taxol i thought id have a leg up on it but its really a very different sort of pain dh thought my tolerance level was higher than most because of the ra but i did end up taking pain meds after the last 2 taxols im back on the anti inflammatory meds today and even thru the pain pills i can feel the difference i just hope that it didnt go too long to require more meds i dont want to go back into treatment for ra until i receive the results of the genetic testing as i dont see the point of starting again only to have to stop again for more surgery etc btw are your toes any better sammiekay thank you for your kind words i think you hit the nail on the head we are all ready to move on i know tx is going to last a while longer for me and im ready to go into the next phase now i dont know what my hurry is tho the rad onc isnt going to do anything until we have the genetic testing results back sigh maisy any sign of the nails coming back yet mine became loose but i didnt lose any good news tho about your energy level lack of energy was pretty much my only side effect now that im on the mend i cant believe just how fatigued i was hillary since i didnt talk to the surgeon yesterday i dont know exactly what she said about the tumor dh did tell me something about it yesterday and i remember asking him again about it last night but i still dont remember as for the ra the pain pills will help some but not much you have to be so careful too if for example the swelling is in the ankle or foot if the pain pills have taken the edge off you have to be really careful not to overdo terry you are right at least the damn thing is gone now and while really not much has changed i do feel better from the whine perspective my whole journey has been this way i dont seem to get really down just pissed off or in a bit of a funk i seem to be able to pull myself out of it right away but only if im allowed to have my moment thanks girls for your thoughts and prayers mine are with you all too talk to you soon carynn hi everybody kathleen my in huntington harbor cal goes to dragon boat racing and she loves it only 4 months ahead of us in the cancer battle and says it is not hard because everyone wnorks together i have to admit to a little jealousy the only support group anywhere near here is a once a month night group 30 miles away and i like to drive at night you guys are it for me so thanks terry can you describe some of the exercises lymphedema is one of those things i feel been thoroughly informed about and i know that radiation increases your chances is anyone else worrying about rads just a little i went in today to get markings and they had me down for starting next quite 2 weeks from the last chemo i said i wanted to wait at least the full 2 weeks everything read says 2 to 3 weeks is standard so then the tech want to mark me they use some sort of super permanent marker instead of tattoos here anyway we rescheduled markings for next week maybe being a cowardly wimp but if rads wear me down then i want to be completely over that last taxol before i start i get a neaulasta shot after the last treatment so a lot less sore but i do feel more worn out than usual got that kind of icky taste in my mouth also be so glad to be over chemo still no hair i did get my pet scans today and i guess be a little stressed until i get results in a couple of days take care everybody kathleen and garnetann really close hurray debbie m oh michelle so sorry i know about set backs and they suck one more day you can do it like djj said we are in your pocket barbara my thoughts and prayers are with you i am so sorry from your posts i can tell you stuck by his side even going through this

painful on my muscles and joints like to start taking biotin for my hair and nails my hair seems thinner than before and i have to keep my fingernails clipped to nubs because they keep peeling holli greetings all new to the community puffin very sorry for your loss it looks like you have a wonderful community here peace to you and your family idc with dcis 2 lumpectomies with positive margins er pr so have a mastectomy scheduled in may and started anastrozole a month ago i too had suffered the vaginal atrophy and mo said he recommend returning to the estrace been using and stopped right after the diagnosis the discomfort started coming back but i changed from astroglide to an organic lubricant called good love worked wonders no more discomfort and it smells like vanilla my current most common issues are the joint pains not bad just irritating mostly my hands and shoulder but now my neck has been stiffening up thanks in advance for your comments and support comforting to know not in this alone oh gawd ladies i can totally relate 54 and a physical therapist which has its good bad points with this whole issue we all just have to stop comparing our present selves with our younger selves i guess on the other hand just because it may take us longer to get back in shape mean we look just as great with a toned up body once we do some glimmer of hope to pass on from week two of rads been exhausted really recoved yet even tho done with rads now because once rads were done i had to go back to work full time so exhausted from that also started tamoxifen had to change antidepressants so eeeeek anyway i have managed to eat a little better made myself do a little toning walk the dog for like miles at least a couple of times a week so i had my fasting lipids done again this week because i was put on zocor for high cholesterol in may another wonderful side effect of but tamoxifen is supposed to lower cholesterol too so i wanted to see if my doc would let me stop the zocor well guess what all my bad numbers were down hugely my the good cholesterol were up which means that it all zocor that did it that my exercise has had a real effect on my system in a very short period of time really only weeks so i get to drop the zocor meanwhile hang in there everyone i respect both sides of the decision and am on the precipice of the tamox decision myself extremely anxious about it chemo has left me hairless for 7 weeks with ongoing gerd and joint pain and inflammation as well as hot flashes and early menopause which not sure is a good thing same as the ooph i think it has serious consequences why did i do it i am a 40 yr old 25 year vegetarian veteran all holistic all organic exercising thin healthy person with no family history there no truth in the stats in my case sadly my real issue with the holistic or alternative routes is that in all of my forum trolling i was never pointed to solid evidence showing there are equal weapons to tamoxifen asked the question over and over on the boards what would you recommend in lieu of chemo rads and tamoxifen what supplements diet lifestyle choices are and alternatives to pharmas do i think this lack of evidence is partially due to the fact that pharmas are the only ones with the bucks to run major studies yes that change the simple fact that when i ask for hard evidence on real alternatives to chemo rads and tamox not been steered to anything convincing there is a huge group in favor of the dr lee progesterone approach some new studies show that progesterone is an inflammatory and can cause bc there are no magic bullets yet hi ladies i finished chemo 6 yesterday my 2nd taxol so far so good with the just a rather sleepless night which may be from the steroids or kytril i feel good otherwise i am using myralax 2x per day starting 1 day before treatment so i hope my constipation problem will be under control previously i had such terrible knife stabbing pains in my side my doc sent me for a cat scan turned out i was backed up in my large intestine way up and to the right of the belly button the pain was intense but cleared up after the miracle of a fleet enema actually after i recovered from the mild from treatment 5 and constipation felt the best ever been since before my 1st surgery in early march dare i say i felt normal almost i know i need to rest for an hour after work or dinner will just not get made for all of us who started chemopause my doc said to keep a record of each time i feel cramps and if i get my period even for a day or 2 after chemo ends he said if i get my period they may have to remove my ovaries ugh just what i need more surgery i had terrible difficulty with my emotions on aromasin i felt so down and fatigued i really began to believe that my life was not worthwhile and there was no point in living it was scary with arimidex i think i was depressed but somewhat more irritable when i stop them i experience a significant brightening of my mood down today with tamoxifen could be not being able to sleep enough or personal probs we shall see good luck i always hoped that with time the ses would lessen but i find that to be the case the longest i was on one arimidex was 8 mos i wish you the best lashon i too was triple neg not to worry triple negs respond very well to chemo i am so glad that you are healing and feeling much better corrine glad you are better lisa hope your burn is healing well how amazing our bodies are not only is my hair growing back but the darkness in my fingernails is growing out people are saying my skin looks much better and i am starting to get some of the feeling back from the taxol neuropathy i am so blessed wishing everyone a good day had only mild and temporary aches in my knees and little fingers from arimidex but before they put me on it i was taking grape seed extract and eating large common white mushrooms every day as they are both aromatase inhibitors see the have had a lot of hot sweats on both the natural and arimidex but they bother me as been getting hot flashes for many years from natural menopause and i choose not to let them interfere with my life so glad cabmom and ritajean have passed their anniversaries with flying colors hugs to all yes ritajean has helped soooo many of us get through tx god bless have been away for awhile but wanted to update everyone am still trying to work out what i will be taking for the next 5 years if anything the fareston is not an alternative because of the cost year my onc wanted me to try tamoxifen again and stopping it today because of the pelvic pain and pressure to see him on and will probably be getting shots once a month though the shots are really for metastatic breast cancer and have not been tried for prevention i went to my stylist last week for my first haircut since starting tx short but curly and kinda cute looking rocktop hang in there girl almost through can be difficult in young women heard also seen a lot of women on this board get oophorectomies to avoid ovarian cancer and hysterectomies with oophorectomies to avoid the potential side effect of endometrial cancer from tamoxifen i would discuss this long and hard with your oncologists simply because of your age they do prescribe drugs like effexor to help with hot flashes but i know if helpful with all the other menopausal effects i had both breast surgery and a hysterectomy bos last year because i had both breast and endometrial cancers for me i had no problems with surgical menopause because i was 63 years old and well past natural menopause on arimidex now and i do have an occasional mild hot flash but again now 64 on the other hand i have this theory based on absolutely no medical background or information that going to start seeing a lot more endometrial cancers because gynecologists are now avoiding the hysterectomies they used to perform on younger women and so women are aging with a uterus intact to grow cancer in there are others on this board your age who will be able to offer you more information advice best wishes to you suzanne had my 2nd dose of taxotere today for some reason the premeds effect me more with taxotere than with the ac even though they are the same i have to fight to stay awake and if i concentrate on what looking at then it seems to be moving lol i also walk out of the infusion room on my own i have to lean on someone because it feels as if someone poured lead in my legs very strange i came home friend drove me and fell right to sleep thank god my mother was able to stay and continue to watch the kids for a little longer starting to feel a bit better tomorrow will begin the waiting for the other shoe to drop game lol my onc concerned about any of my side effects as usual he was glad in chemopause and having hot flashes guess a good thing i see him again for 6 more weeks when have my last infusion telling myself that means he expect me to need him before then and a good thing oh i gained 4 lbs i knew i had gained something because all my clothes seem too small or tight and i can now wear clothes that were too big i was shocked that it was that much though in only 3 wks everyone is thrilled but me lol going to take some getting used to especially the jiggly part around my waist now christine so my first taxotere was the first tx without developing hemorrhoids wondering if it was the cytoxan that was causing it i hope yours go away completely soon are you feeling better yet from your last tx i had heart palpitations last night i sure hate those i hope yours have quit already hard to feel relaxed when having those or at least it is for me i wanted to see a cardiologist by my onc is convinced everything is fine experienced a bit of hair loss since the 1st taxotere but it been much however pretty sure the eyelashes are starting to go i wonder how long the eye brows will hang in there sigh going to miss those oh i mentioned the burning mouth sensation i get and my onc recommended as well as the salt water and baking soda rinses been taking lysine actually but i think enough it should be 1000 mg a day so hoping better this time between that and my tender gums and sore bones in my face i have a hard time imagining i ate enough to gain 4 lbs must be a lower metabolism or something good luck ladies i know going to be hard when your hair starts to fall out but you can do it it really been that bad when wearing my scarf or a hat most p even look twice and the ones that do just smile and move on a woman came into my office today while i was waiting and she was topless i want to be that brave someday getting there i get the mail topless and opened the door topless to a stranger trying to sell something hehehe and he run away lol just afraid of having to deal with comments from strangers i like to be ignored while in public so i can do what i need to do and go home fortunately in this case my children are usually acting like barely control animals which keeps most people away from us wishing you all a great week cynthia hi all i like pam did not experience the intense bone pain until i began my taxol treatments first i had 4 ac infusions biweekly followed by neulasta shot i had some stiffness and creakiness second i had 4 taxol and gemzar infusions biweekly followed by neulasta shot after each taxol infusion i had extreme leg and back pain in my bones it lasted for about 4 or 5 days after each treatment i have heard so many people say and it may be true that the bone pain comes from the neulasta a lot of people have tac all in the same infusion and then the neulasta here to tell you from experience that i do believe the taxol or taxetere is responsible for the larger portion of the bone pain my oncologist was always questioning me about pain and neuropathy during the taxol gemzar infusions more so than during the ac treatments just to share god bless lillie really great that so many of you are finishing up chemo this week it must really be a great feeling i wait to get there please keep checking in to let us know how you are coming along after making it through such an ordeal yesterday i attended a local look good feel better session it was fun met some nice people and got a lot of really nice chanel mac estee lauder etc they also gave out some wigs although the one they gave me was really bad kind of looks like a toupee over the past few days i have really been feeling out of sorts i think that it has a lot to do with the fact that i have been suffering from insomnia especially due to the night sweats ever since i started the taxol and the lack of sleep is really starting to effect my daily activities last night i finally broke down and took a xanac that my ob gyn had prescribed for me for anxiety before the bc diagnosis for the first time in a while i slept through the night but now i feel both lethargic and overwhelmed at the same time i really just need a break i see that many of you are planning to take some time off after chemo and or during radiation if you have it i would like to take some time off as well but i fear that i will just lay in the bed and become depressed by all that i have had to deal with over the past few months i mean to whine but i just needed to get these feelings off my chest my best to all recovering from treatment last week and those having treatment this week hang in there steph recently gone over 3 years on tamoxifen am 51 now 2 years without a period my onc wants me to switch to aromasin or another ai if i tolerate that but not thrilled with the idea of depleting all my estrogen sharon 50 have you noticed any difference in hair thickness or skin being less dry and wrinkly since you stopped i may sound vain but this is one of the things i worry most about with the ais aging even more rapidly than i already am just going to go without any meds at all for a month or two and see how i feel just being in natural menopause without any meds then maybe start up the ai to see how it affects me if i know that most of the effects are reversible that would be encouraging to hear sflow you had an early stage cancer just like mine so that means that the odds are greatly in your favor not to have a reoccurrence if changed anything about your lifestyle such as exercising more and eating more veggies etc you also are decreasing your risk that way too i felt really tired all the time and put it off to an se of arimidex my dh met a doctor who is a mutual friend and told her how tired i was and that my nails were splitting and my voice was gravelly the doctor said that arimidex suppresses the thyroid and i should have a full panel done i requested a full panel and when the results came back my tsh was completely normal but my free t4 was very low the doctor said that was very unusual when i asked him how often he tested free t4 when the tsh was normal he said that it done i then said how do you know that this very common among women complaining of fatigue i started taking a that contains iodine and taking iodine drops and my free t4 is within normal range i no longer have that overwhelming tiredness all the time i suggest that anyone with continual fatigue have a full thyroid panel done i am now just off tamoxifen after 3 years being on it switched now to aromasin they both have hair loss as side effects and yes i experienced some with tamoxifen chrisct my hair also came in very curly loved loved it after losing it to chemo then it straightened out as well since it was thinning my hairdresser suggested i perm it which i did and i love it i even comb my hair at all so as not to pull any out even with comb i just scrunch and go i have heard people say their hair grew back more full after being done with these drugs there is hope perms do help too i got the curliest one so last a long time and yes i will get another one done once this grows out the things we go thru juli btw my hair started changing to more and thinner right before dx of cancer are you on tamoxifen that can cause hair thinning about 7 months post chemo and am still dealing with chemo curl it does feel thinner to me now but not sure how it will end up when the chemo curl goes away hey everybody i started on the 27th of may but since the may list is a bit quiet lately i thought i would hop on here like other people i had my first dose of abraxane with nothing else i had limited that started friday night and lasted through sunday it was totally tolerable and felt like i was fatigued and had body aches and nausea overall not as bad as i thought it was going to be in fact startingtue i was feeling like a normal person again i get chemo every friday with an unknown schedule now at least through oct and the verdict is still out about a bone med i had a very rare allergic reaction to zometa had to go to the er we are looking at using xgeva instead which i might get this week hope everyone has a good chemo month with easy minii also felt very depressed with tamoxifen i am still taking tamoxifen and i do think that it has been responsible for the depression at least partially since it happen til a year after my tx was finished anyway as far as anti depressants go you can not take an ssri with tamoxifen it will interfere with your absorption of the tamoxifen so you will need to take a different anti depressant i have read that even effexor which was given to me at first is a weak inhibitor of tamoxifen so you want to take anything that might interfere with your absorption of tamoxifen good luck please keep us posted and let us know what your dr suggests harley hi catherine fellow kiwi i too am at my heaviest i expected to get skinny from chemo not put on weight the tamoxifen has also added pounds yay for your first anniversary where in nz are you this is a great bunch of ladies really enjoyed getting to know them kim been thinking of you today dh should be home with you sure you are thrilled yay stefajoy i have had bone mets for nine years i had luck with hormone meds each one helping for about two years i suffered the most with the target med afinitor and was only on it for 3 months i then went to mdanderson two years ago for a second opinion which my oncologist was all in favor of they felt the chemo pill xeloda would help i was surprised when i returned when my doctor said i should take a chemo break after talking to the anderson doctor i think the plan was maybe for six or eight months month 7 or 8 i had arm pain and the bone met at c4 was pressing against a nerve so i had that radiated a few weeks after that i started xeloda which was an easy chemo for me six months later the mets were all sleeping again i have always had several from the beginning my pet scan in april showed three reappearing so off of xeloda my doctor then wanted me to start my first iv chemo abraxane i myself said no as i decided to take a few months off before chemo to visit hawaii etc i just seem to get a sense with my oncologist who i have always trusted that she and other doctors fear that the bone mets will spread to organs and their patient will fault them if they give them a break she never said that after so many years it is unlikely they will spread so now i sit after a week of abraxane and feel miserable with neuropathy of hands and feet i can hardly type with my right hand i see my doctor this afternoon i guess i feel doctors can never predict our future in 2006 my first oncologist gave me only two to five years to live i sent her a letter at year five and told her to never tell another patient how long they have to live unless they ask and to never tell a patient this info over a phone i plan to send her another letter in april 2016 when i reach year 10 i think you should ask your doctor if he has read statistics about the mets not spreading if they have not in four years and let us know i think it would be nice if we were told of all of the possible of the taxol i had a much easier time with the ac the only place i have seen about the raspy voice is on these boards also some nose bleeding it keeps me wondering what to expect during my 2nd half of taxol are there other i know about i also have thrush and sores on my tongue from the taxol only had a very small problem with that with ac had this for over a week now andam on 3 meds for it you would think with my mouth being so sore that i would be losing weight but i guess it stopped me from getting all my calories shucks mlb yes glad that we are able to catch things early ali no it does not make me feel better to know of the problems with your kids its tough you know we still have to deal with life in addition to the bc challenges it can wear on i am taking tamoxifen every day hildy anemia is commonly linked with colon cancer because it often causes slow loss of blood over time my mo thinks that my anemia might be related to my running which also happens sometimes in distance runners which is through mild loss of blood through the urine or it could be from chemo or it could be from the combination but being cautious he ordered a bunch of tests and we found this little tumor in my bladder hoping that its nothing but then i have a good history of avoiding rare things like male bc doing ok just feel a little battle fatigue but i will do what i need to do i appreciate the support that we share here i was also diagnosed in may 2006 i was premenopausal and 48 years old i guess some could argue i was perimenopausal but my periods were very regular every single month anyway after my 4 ac treatments i did not have any more periods my oncologist did bloodwork which was slowly creeping down to menopausal levels and after a time she deemed me in menopause i was on tamoxifen for 2 years and just went off of it this spring due to uterine lining thickening my oncologist after uterine biopsies every six months by my gyn for the thickening finally said this spring that the risks outweighed the benefits and i should come off the tamox well four months later i now have my period back i am now 52 years old i just had a checkup this past month i thought for sure she was going to tell me to see the gyn and that i should have a hysterectomy or something nope she says well that is okay because i think you could use a bit of estrogen since chemo i have osteoporosis have never slept a whole night through without waking up all night long and have terrible memory problems i get into all the nutty things i have done in the past four years my cancer was er but more so pr and her 2 my doctor has taken such great care of me that i want to trust this judgment she has made but it kind of scares me too she said that my ovaries woke up jeepers all of my close friends are naturally menopausal or at least very close to it i just know what to think about this at all hello sisters i am back my 3rd chemo on weekly taxol on monday and tuesday was busy clearing work today is my 2nd day after chemo and i am experiencing hot flushes heart palpitations dry skin teary eyes neuropathy and faitugue after first two experiences i think i will be at my worst on friday any one experiencing heart palpitations i feel like my heart is jumping out from my mouth and the hot flushes like my ears are going to be fire soon i cannot even perform simple tasks like tying a knot opening up my shampoo etc i asked the nurses on my side effects was told that they will not change the drug if the side effects are bearable changing to another chemo drug is no good for the body since i was already on my 3rd dose and if the cream works for my yeast then it should be fine well i should be glad then at least next monday onwards my chemo is counting down to single digit another 9 sessions to go hi gma 04 lark twohobbies marsha rambo thanks i think i used my water jet spray too hard and with the yeast infection theskin was thin so i must have aggravated it the tridermcream prescribed by mygeneral practitioneris working and it has mostly recovered hi lana just wondering if you are drawing blood from the port my oncologist has special instructions not to draw blood from my port in case of blood clog hi girlstrong sorry to see you here but you will find great support hang in there ihad a very hard time withac i did four ac now i am on my weeky taxol same as you 12 weeky taxols the taxol is better more manageable for me if you read on though everyone has different experiences hugs to all i am thinking of everyone and hoping every treatment is on time and quickly end the ordeal jazzy i have no idea about those nails i know my eyelashes keep falling out i hate it this is the second time after chemo that the fell out grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrhave no idea i figured mine keep falling back out due to herceptin and i know herceptin is the reason all my nails my long natural nails cracked off to short little nothings doctors did tell me herceptin can cause nail issues sooooooooooooo if i were to guess at your troubles i would blame herceptin good luck and sorry about this tracy welcome have a great vacation good for you for participating in a clinical trial i think great i tried to get into a couple because i believe in supporting research but so far been qualified or the timing is wrong etc etc my pcp had me take three days to taper down off the zoloft then had me do a week on a small dose of effexor the next week on 75mg of it which is the smallest therapeutic dose i felt the ol depressive paralysis coming back tho by the end of last week so they told me i could double the effexor i understand that 150mg is more the usual dose anyway nancy noticed more of my ol arthritis kicking up lately too so much so that my hips back were waking me up at night not sure what to attribute it to either although inclined to agree with you that more weather related also due to my trying to take longer longer walks with the dog so finally i went back to our old remedy of tylenol pm last night felt good would have slept the whole night through except my dog woke me up at 3am to go out because he had diarrhea from eating some of leftover cheese sandwich oh shari makraz you poor girls menopause has its virtues for sure i have noticed some vaginal discharge very light nothing and i read that this is a common se with tamoxifen otherwise been fine maybe a few more hot flashes but then again that time of year wheni know how to dress so i start out with a sweater on because the morning is cold but then when inside too hot in a sweater so have to take it off layers are the answer i guess kathi donna iam sorry that you are also dealing with the pain mine lasts from the first days of infusion until about 2 weeks i had 2 rounds of rads last year and i think that doxil just reawakens the rads and surgery sites unfortunately my left le hand is red and sore now right hand is ok must be hand foot syndrome from the rubbing of wearing my le glove i am more comfy wrapping all day at this point and not wearing my sleeve and glove i just feel like all the forward strides that made with the lehave justdone a 180 this is so frustrating because otherwise doxil is great well except for a major mouth sore keep us posted on how you do barb bluejay i ve been on tamoxifen since june 2007 and doing fine i felt very irritable for the first two weeks i was on it then i was fine after that heard that a lot of women have hot flashes and weight gain on it but neither has been a problem for me i was 41 when i went on it hope that helps i hope it helps us both bobbie thanks everyone some people asked which trial i am doing it is this one i am in the arm that gets carbo taxol plus velaparib placebo i have had one cycle so far i had the chemo on tues and was pretty sick for a whole week after but now am doing better i will talk to my onc this week about getting meds next time to help all they gave me were 3 zofran tablets it enough and that was only because i asked they told me i need anything i also had bad diarrhea dizziness lack if appetite nausea and bone pain in my ankles wrists hands and feet also pain under my ribs maybe my liver i will only have my next scans in seven weeks so am hoping it is working thanks everyone for asking after me i did taxotere i had neutropenia and had to take neupogen i shaved my head regularly until chemo was done as stand stubble and the growth was sparse by the end of my treatments i was pretty tired but was able to return to work 3 weeks later 2 years later i have a full head of still unruly curls which i love to hate lol the hair issues are so temporary for most try not to sweat them good luck with the last leg of your chemo interested in what your doc said about navelbine on it now with avastin my tx history is a follows tac 6 rounds 3 with avastin surgery immediate reconstruction radiation ned avastin xeloda as extra protection ended that in march 09 may 09 pet smalll hot spot in supraclavicular june 09 sept 09 gemzar carbo avastin sept 09 pet ned oct 09 jan 10 continue with gemzar carbo avastin as extra feb 10 pet supraclavicular back and some new nodes in chest area now doing navelbine avastin just stand thought of loosing hair again this will cause thinning worried about avastin and rebound affect doc said more worried about it growing and spreading until parp available navelbine has been tough with major constipation after first 2 navelbine treatments day 5 is the bewitching day constipation sets in and its so bad i cry for help hydration ivs and major laxatives 3rd treatment not so bad gee maybe it was a good idea to tell me navelbine causes serious constipation kytril that was given for antinausea causes constipation and the xanax i take to sleep due to the decadron causes constipation have reglan added to drip and that is suppose to help take reglan pills for first 3 days to help lots of natural flakes apple cider oj runny eggs etc no xanax at all lower decardon dose and simply sleep to get through the first few days of steroid hyperactivity good luck with the choices its never easy beachgirl hope everyone is feeling good today finally starting to feel like myself but still not back to normal after treatment an update about what i thought was a bladder infection i think i mentioned that my nurse saw i called the emergency line sunday and told me to come in for a urine sample i went in peed in a cup went back to work never heard anything back so i kept on taking the antibiotics luckily my hospital chain has a patient portal online and you can see all of your lab results appointments bills etc and i got a notification that my test results were up it clearly meant nothing to me but it did confirm that there was blood in my urine so i called the mo the next day and another nurse called me back to tell me that not an infection and to stop taking the antibiotics hmm ok so i asked why blood in my urine i stumped her she kept saying what i was seeing was from the adriamyacin which i knew right b c the red stuff last 3 days she then told me probably just my period um no i know not so she put me on hold and then came back saying she talked to the nurse practitioner and it seems to be from the cytoxan it can cause sepsis like symptoms including blood in the urine and to just stay hydrated still not a fan of the answer but bring it up again with my mo when i see her next week the blood has gone away completely today it seems so at least that is over with sigh i was premenopause at dx age 49 and requested the laproscropic ooph to take ais i was strong er pr and did not want to take tamoxifen and lupron shots for several years the lap ooph procedure was same day surgery and the most discomfort was immediately afterwards due to gas movement they inflate the abdominal cavity during surgery for exploratory and post surgery this causes some pain as the gas moves out of your body by the next day i was fine and walking around you are restricted to not lift heavy objects for a few weeks but i was able to drive almost immediately i am very glad i did it joann hi sham i now have blood clots in both lungs as well as numerous lesions in liver zometa is given as an infusion like chemo and xgeva is given as an injection these are purely to strengthen the bone and can go on for years or months depends on the patient response i have stopped after a year as my calcium levels are good now aromasin is used to stop the body producing estregen and would have no effect on your mums breathing the radiation would be to ease the bone spots that are painful as an area can only be radiated once they will save radiation till it hurts it can bring wonderful relief as can medication such as oxycontinen or endone i have been on abraxane chemotherapy and found it was easy on my body with a good reponse apart from loosing my hair i went on another chemo that gave me a heap of issues and now i start abraxane again next week hope this helps you and your mum finds the right chemo and meds love gai just finished a year of herceptin 3 weeks ago i hadit every week during the 12 weeks of chemo had 4 txt of taxotere cytoxan which ended nov 09 and then every 3 weeks from nov thru aug 2010 i really think i had any side effects muga was excellent but reading this may explain the sores in one nostril i have attributed it to chemo drying everything out but since herceptin ended my nose is feeling better so thinking that may have been a se i really notice any joint or muscle pain until i started femara i was pretty miserable for about 3 months but the serious pain has subsided and ankles just take a while to get started after waking or sitting for long periods then fine my onc also noted that this was due to fast forced menopause i was premenopausal at 55 my onc has also said that studies are showing it may not be necessary for a full year of herceptin i know one sister said been on it 7 years that may be due to being stage 4 just glad i tolerated it well i consider it my insurance policy blessings to all i have not had night sweats since i went through menopause naturally at age 36 for three years i kept a spare set of jamas and sheets next to the bed when i got up to go to the bathroom my rather perfect husband would get up and change the sheets i would switch my jamas and sleep through the rest of the night of course i now know that this is when my tumor started to grow hot flashes were a given while taking aromasin a drug that i took for about 7 years when we dropped the aromasin and i was only receiving faslodex the hot flashes went away with the introduction of graves disease hot flashes started to sound good i have been cold for over a year now and only recently with an adjustment of my synthroid rx i am finally feeling warm again i no longer sleep with a sweater over my tank and shirt i can go to bed without two pairs of socks i take the good stuff wherever i can get them my memory too bad these days has been far worse lots of words hope it is useful susan i had hormone pr and oestro positive cancer 100 mine was in the lymph too i had lumpectomy and lymphs removed and chemo v high dose i started zolodex hormone therapy but pulled out after a few goes i also did not have a mascetomy i was sposed to have i felt too ill after chemo to have the surgery and also felt as if the treatment i was having was for some reason going on this downward path i just felt i was getting i had read about idiodine and was annoyed my doctors never mentioned these studies to me i had started to not be happy about the amount of info i was being given i started going to a chinese doctor and read the book the china study he gave me the herbs he gave me helped my energy levels a lot and the diet made me feel a lot healthier and my headaches went the acupuncture etc improved my mood a lot i started researching diet and cancer and this led me to decide to refuse further hormone therapy i drink soy instead as i read it acts like tamoxifen and occupies the receptors to me it seems that this should help reduce my oestrogen exposure also im encouraged by whati read about the chinese and cancer and i know they eat a lot of soy also i believe that the diet im on shud drop my hormone levels it did not seem natural to me to put my body into early menopause i thought this might cause me health problems for some reason just a feeling i had another reason i stopped hormone treatment was it was starting to give me facial hair as a side effect and growing a beard wud kinda interfere with my quality of life a bit much for me anyway that was just one more reason for me the question i have is how many here were told that there could be permanent hair loss back in january several weeks afteri finisheda c chemo my mo wanted me to go on taxotere immediately and i do mean that very day there were no packets of information no warnings at all about permanent hair loss i already was bald from the a c not a single mention so he either broke the law if there was one or there a law about full disclosure i am curious how many ladies here recently taking taxotere were actually informed in advance about permanent hair loss hopefully they be part of the 6 but from my own experience were they even told i and that was this year as i said in a much earlier post i declined taxotere for health reasons other than the hair loss issue in addition to having already done spectacularly well on the prior a c and saw no need to take additional risks with so little potential returns labelle glad our responses to your question have helped put you at ease for the future as for your question to me about tamoxifen i declined the opportunity to mess around with my hormones such as they are at 73 dx came at 71 at this age my biggest sources of estrogen are fat and carbohydrates like sugar and processed starches both of which i can control with wise diet choices without playing around with and trying to fool mother nature besides cancer cells are smart and they mutate so no guarantee that they can be fooled as easily as the drug companies want us to believe besides i read many medical journal articles about the fatal problems that tamoxifen causes and quite frankly a stroke or blood clots deep vein thrombosis are bigger threats both invisible until they wreak their havoc to my longevity than something a mammo and or a clinical exam can find should it occur again by the way i also have lost the 12 pounds that i had put on in the year and a half before my diagnosis and am keeping it off and am getting enough sunshine to keep my vitamin d levels high i also questioned the logic by the way of taking a drug that causes weight gain when the best natural way to curb estrogen at my age is to lose weight my medical team is fine with my decision my breast surgeon was fine with my decision since he knows that i do 90 mins at the gym resistance abs and cardio workouts 3 times a week and am hardly sedentary when not at the gym i saw a medical oncologist once and while she favored tamoxifen when she saw the research data i had collected she offered to order an oncotype test to get a more personal genetic view of my status when she reported it as a 12 she was okay with my declining the drug as long as i would be able to live with my decision i am her role in is being taken by my surgeon who will continue to monitor me after my 6 month checkup schedule goes down to yearly checks after year 3 or 4 my rad onc was the one least on board with my decision but she has accepted it as long as i am faithful about vigilant monitoring i am as an aside were off the table even faster than tamoxifen for me since my husband and i are hikers and joint and muscle pain and osteoporosis would put an end to that happy part of our lives but right now even think about hormonal therapy just concentrate on recovering from the with nothing stronger than getting back to full strength as quickly as possible and staying fit so that rads will not fatigue you best tg dear lynette so sorry you had such a rough time i found the fec caused me a lot of nausea i get the dex for the nausea until the third treatment and it did help a bit more with the nausea is your problem that you forgot to take your meds i e fell asleep is there someone living with you who can take charge of this and make up a schedule and make sure you take everything on time my nurse recommended that i take the nausea meds before i felt nauseated so preventatively rather than after the fact it seemed to work better water is the best thing to drink to flush your system i have taxol either i had neuropathy with ac so my dr felt taxotere every 3 weeks would be best for me but it has caused other issues that i have with ac and i too have had some numbness in my fingertips evenwith taxotere it seems to get better right before my next tx which is tomorrow let the horrible weekend begin take care stay strong hi ladies its nice to see you are all posting again and it sounds like you are all starting started rads i hope those of you starting tamoxifen are finding it ok i dont find the hot flushes so bad now as it is so much cooler but i am still alot warmer than i have ever been the big sweaters are still in the wardrobe and the not as high as normal other family members not impressed with this but never mind i finally got some boots yesterday after trying on about 10 pairs they are only cheapies for work so i am going to check out the website for a decent pair and may well get oh to buy them for christmas this week has seen me have my first period for 11 years i was on depo before dx so my body is finally getting back to normal after all this which is nice plus it means i hit the dreaded menopause yet and have to change to an aromatose inhibitor which sound like a nightmare from other threads i hope oh will be home on friday but not definate yet it is a bit lonely now when he is away cos the kids are grown up now and doing their own thing but it makes it extra special when we are all here i get rediculously excited if there is 4 of us for dinner lol ajxxx kate how wonderful that you had such a great time with your friend i will put killer shrimp on my pipe dream list for if ever in the la area and of course i will look you up i do feel for your friend i bet it is hard to meet men from that job my itching has been almost nil and my spots seem to be healing but i went back to the derm today and now bummed the biopsy path report said reactive perforating collagenosis where a deeper layer of skin penetrates the outer layer which was visible under the microscope he trusts this pathologist so his diagnosis he said if you go online to look this up and i know you will going to be freaked out because it generally appears along with something dire he said seen it only a few times and always in patients who were already on dialysis it is usually a features of kidney disease eg from diabetes or some other kidney failure he said it also appears with lymphoma thyroid cancer and now found some other liver dysfunction and so on my derm is not really worried he said it would be extremely weird for this symptom to be the only manifestation of one of those diseases he said with an itchy rash always a question of whether a rash that itches or an itch that rashes in my case he thinks the latter tamoxifen made me itch so i scratched and that brought the rash the biopsied skin showed signs of having been scratched so he thinks the perforating behavior is an unusual result of scratching my tamoxifen itch i am not really convinced i wonder if the skin was already compromised by the triamcinolone which he told me has a thinning effect so it was easily perforated or if maybe the sample got messed up of course also concerned that i could have something bad he need to see me again for a month during which time to stay on the cream and tamoxifen but he told me to go have a complete physical with cbc and thyroid checks now scheduled one for and exchanged emails with my mo about what tests my pcp should do it help my mood that having tummy trouble today and also did a couple of days ago been told that an occasionally grumbly tummy is very normal for someone at my age harumph and i did take a couple of food risks in the last few days but still i have to wonder i was expecting the biopsy to be inconclusive which would have been ok given that my skin seems to be doing better so it was hard to get this exotic and kind of alarming diagnosis i was soooo ready for no drama i know you can all understand that when i got home i felt overwhelmed and tired that particular tired you get when you know it just physical i bailed out of some afternoon commitments and going to do the minimum tonight u4iachic stomach in knots then that is a yes and probably everyone here had that the unknown and waiting is the worst knowledge is power and calms the nerves visit the forums here a lot of good solid info in real time stay away from google a lot of bad old info there i help you on the cold cap but others in the forums will have answers for that i had a real hair wig made and i love it wash it once a wig flat iron and i am good to go i have energy to fight with my own hair i am so hoping my hair grows back better than i had before my hair is about inch long and my eyebrows and eyelashes are growing back already i trust my care team to guide me and i am not going to over think a choice or procedure as things change without warning i have 14 doctors and i hope they get it right is your tc taxol and cytoxan i had 8 neulasta shots one after every chemo treatment i had ac t it was fine with the ac i had bone and muscle pain with taxol the mo suggested claritin 2 hours before the injection and every day for 4 to 5 days to relieve the pain it did not work so i switched to tylenol with codeine worked fine the last neulasta was only a half dose please worry about the nodes nothing until something i had 5 positive nodes before my chemo and mastectomy surgery pathology zero positive nodes and everyone reacts differently to chemo rads and results you are blessed to have a supportive family enjoy the love and laughter that will bring you use the boards for research venting and ranting any questions please post away everyone here will help you we all have questions there will be many things you can do to make it through chemo we all have a long list of tips that will help if you ask for suggestions you will get a lot of replies i can pm my list for you if you think it would help you take a break and enjoy the weekend day 5 after my first taxol treatment the bone pain has been unreal i normally tolerate pain very well bu this is unexpected and unbearable motrin and tylenol do not help i took lortabs left over from my mastectomy that touch the pain either has anyone else been experiencing such severe bone pain i had planned on a little muscle soreness and something similar to mild arthritic pain but this is insane if this is only my first i cannot imagine what cumulative effects will be like oy i took tamoxifen for 3 years with no joint pain but then had to have a complete hysterectomy after the removal of my ovaries i ache all the time hands feet ankles etc i was supposed to switch to an ai but due to joint pain my onc kept me on tamoxifen i believe it is the lack of estrogen that contributes to the joint pain so you mighty want to think about this in my case i fell worse after the surgical menopause than i did before i can deal with the hot flashes but i feel like i am achey all the time tonlee i am concerned about the very thing you mentioned with my libido being so high perhaps my estrogen level is also high and that is what trying to avoid by taking the tamoxifen in the first place i have some minor leg cramps an occasional hot flash but none of the typical tamoxifen se no vaginal dryness increased libido i actually feel really really good now i have lost some weight 60 lbs and i work out 5 days a week in the past those two things have contributed to an increased sense of wellbeing and extra confidence that make me want sex more and make my periods regular but i still have a lot of weight to lose i see the onc in june i plan to run all this by him again we have discussed this in the past but maybe he would do lupron on a trial basis and if the lupron brings on intense meno symptoms i would do the ooph boy will my dh be upset if he has the vasectomy and then i end up doing the ooph after all i did see the discussion regarding all of this in the past few days actually what got me thinking again i want to spend my life trying to outrun cancer but i do want to feel at peace that i have done everything i can to be an old old woman woke up in the middle of the night sore all over couldnt even touch myself without an ouch feel like one must after a few rounds with tyson im on taxotere too which causes bone and joint pain but this seem a little different oh well extra strength tylenol heating pad and bed for the day saniasia good job girl i remember when you first came on and were about to start chemo now you have hair and are topless yours grew fast isnt it just the best feeling and jamieh is right it is amazing how much more product i use on my hair that it is 2 inches long than i ever did when it was to my waist been dealing with some really bad anxiety and hot flashes the last few days do any of you ladies on tamoxifen find the hot flashes are off and on last week i hardly had any and the past 24 hours i have had more than i can count my night sleep was horrible because i was freezing then sweating all night long i am taking celexa for the anxiety and felt like it was helping a bit with the flashes do they ever stop im 40 and have a new found respect for my mother im sure my anxiety probably doesnt help i feel so stressed sometimes about recurrence that i get myself worked up how are you ladies dealing with this i cant seem to get any comfort in the numbers my doc gives me about my low chances of recurrence i just keep focusing on the stories i hear i have been told it is normal the first year to feel like this i sure hope it subsides soon grandmamickey great news hope you are ok must be good to get the surgery out of the way cafelovr good news on the gene test i have my second sole herceptin treatment today straight after the radiation still having lots of aches and pain from the taxotere and intend to havea serious discussion with the onc about it believe 6 weeks pfc just wish my hair would grow faster becoming obsessive about it it is growing but just not fast enough i can see lots of new shorter darker hairs coming in hope all doing ok sue marsha how are you this morning i saw your posts on circle the wagons tamoxifen will thicken the lining which is just behind the uterus lining this is normal the onc told me not to see the obgy before at least 2 months after chemo and not to have any tests because they will show this thickening and may send us into a spiral of biopsies etc which are not needed so make sure to talk at length about that with you doc the risk of uterus cancer after 5 years on tamox is fairly low the onc told me the risk is for severely overweight women with poor diet habits etc the good side of tamox it strengthens bone density i hope you are not too uncomfortable with all this i must admit that tamox is potent my hot flashes are incredibly drenching i wonder whether summer temps make them worse i have to remind myself to drink plenty to replennish my fluid balance morning stiffness and joint pain are here now not unbearable but noticeable ankles lower back and hips gardening is getting interesting i feel 100 y old when time to get back up on my feet but as soon as i move around the pain goes away i cannot spend my days walking through the neighboorhood or biking accross town just for not getting stiff if i stop moving thinking of you all and wishing you a gentle monday if there is such a thing big hugs to all catherine hi carol just guessing here about the dosage but unless a doctor would give a dose no chemo treatment is considered as palliative usually when a cancer patient goes to palliative care they are not given chemotherapy of any kind i have bone and lung mets and have been battling fluid from pleural effusions in both lungs for the past year this past monday istarted my third round of gemzar gemcitabine in august i had a pleural catheter placed inmyrightlung so i coulddrain the fluid myself within a little over a month the fluid in my right lung dried up and no new fluid came into my lung i had the catheter removed and had one placed in my left lung now no longer able to get any fluid when i try to drainit and will have it removed soon no new fluid is coming into either lung gemzar is the only treatment received so it has to be responsible for the fluid stopping my latest tumor marker test went up 2 pts my onc said a rise of only 2 pts is considered stable the previous tumor marker test came down from 209 to 164 i will be getting scanned after completing this round 3 treatments i have only taken one other chemo navelbine since my stage iv diagnosis it worked to some degree for a while and then stopped so i was switched to gemzar i am not getting palliative care and my onc is using gemzarin hopes ofkilling my cancer not just keeping me stable what may have you confused is the fact that gemzar as well as navelbine is among the chemo drugs that have milder side effects than some of theothers i lost my hair and have not had serious problems with nausea skin problems and the other that some of the harsher chemo drugs cause my counts however dropped on both drugs navelbine took my way down gemzar caused my and platelets to drop slightly and my dropped so low that i had to be given a drug to help rebuild mythem both drugs also caused fatigue many members have had very good results with gemzar and have had very little trouble with side effects maybe they will post their experiences with it i hope gemzar works well for you jan is anyone else experiencing headaches on femara every afternoon i develop a mild but annoying headache which sort of feels like a sinus headache which eventually dissipates with an advil been on femara for 2 years and this seems to have started at just about the time my hand and wrist aches disappeared how about that the aches just move around been on arimidex anastrazole for over six years now ses come and go raising their ugly heads right now with a lot of pain in several joints had some on both the brand name and generic formulas but lately the generic seems to be the strongest been told that tamoxifen reduce the estrogen in the body only prevents the er cancer cells from feeding on it but the ses sound the same as the estrogen reducing ais lots of joint pain similar to arthritis it seems we just get around that one hi hoping i can get some advice insight into the difference between doing 7 vs 8 rounds of chemo after my last round of taxotere 6 i experienced awful bone pain in my back and lower legs which is still happening a week later scheduled for my 7th round next thursday 15 and think be able to handle getting through to 8 since each round is cumulative my question is how much of a differences does it make if you do 7 vs 8 my sister was only able to complete 7 and is fine today by the grace of god has anyone talked that heir oncologist about this thanks ladies log in to post a reply shazza hope you are remaining flu free you need that on top of everything else moving on to doxil on monday not in favor of it for many reasons however my question is how many of you have been dealing with lower extremity swelling from taxol especially my feet toes seems the longer away from it the worse it gets heard somewhere it takes awhile to regress from capillary leakage of chemo the swelling does make its way up the calf as well welcome suladog been on anastrozole about the same length of time as peggy i did have some aching in my knuckles and knees for about 3 weeks read that staying active and exercising helps so made sure i walked the treadmill at the y and used the weight machines and one day i stopped and realized hey my hands and knees hurt any more also taken glucosamine chondroitin with msm have taken that for years my oncologist had said weight gain was a possible side effect i got a fitbit one for christmas and between eating healthy and going to the y i gain weight i lost 9 pounds hi everyone i been great to updating here i started my ddac on jan 9th and i am done with ac cycle on end of feb from this march i started taxol for next 12 weeks i am getting it right now and it is my 2nd round during ddac the side effects were pretty controlled with pre medications so i have to be too nauseous i felt very tired for days after the treatment but i was able to back to close to normal on following week my hair start falling around my after 2nd round of ddac i shaved my hair because i got sick of cleaning my hair everywhere my hair gone completely i still have some hair today my eyebrows and lashes are still there i was able to eat normal and try to eat whatever but try to be healthy choice i hard on myself to limit diet i puke even though i sometimes felt upset stomach or have no appetites i got neulasta shot for 3 times and after 2nd time my wbc decline but increased so my doc stop to give me you ladies want to careful for the neulasta because of it cost i was supported by insurance and financial assistant from the facility so i have to deal with it but it was charged around per shot to my insurance company it was crazy so started taxol i was premeditated with benedryl and it put me in sleep today nurse suggested claratin instead and i am trying it i hope it will be ok i hope you all doing ok i know it is tough but we can go through this i am also going back to my work from april moving forward the only problem i had with abraxane was gas and indigestion sounds strange but it would happen a day or two after treatment and last maybe a day or two good luck with it hi im a newby so its good to know there are others with similar questions and fears i started tamoxifen in dec and wondered when folks started to get flushes if at all im finding the tiredness and blurred vision are enough to cope with so far thanks laura my onc has talked to me about ovary removal too he wants me to have the genetic testing done first but it looks like that will probably be in the near future for me also er pr in chemopause right now but at 38 the chances in real menopause are a little slim as for breast reconstruction i was able to have immediate reconstruction on one breast and had to wait 10 days for the side with lymph nodes dissection had implants put in and had saline injections until chemo started when done have the permanent implants put in and get the finishing touches anyone experience a lot of clumsiness on taxol i have a little bit of neuropathy in my feet but i have become a total klutz ok i spell anymore either hi everyone i just finished my last round of tch 6 and am now onto herceptin for 6 more months very glad i made it thru without anything major the heartburn is worse this time but hopefully the omeprazole will kick in neuropathy is worse in feet but hopefuly will now decrease my problem is that i am gaining way too much weight 30 pounds since end of january have had a mastecomy thyroidectomy which no doubt messed up my metabolism and type of foods i eat have changed due to the heartburn issue i use to eat a lot of salads and vegetables and it is hard to eat them right now i crave the white stuff potatoes rice creamy pudding does anyone have any ideas on what to eat to decrease heartburn with foods that are not so fattening also have people heard that herceptin puts on weight i am trying to figure out if weight gain is due to thyroid or herceptin or perhaps both suepeet i agree with karin on the vein thing the last time i got my blood drawn the nurse said oh thank god you drink water i had just heard her tell 2 people before me they needed to do that at least it hurt rock hugs to you and adrienne i will be thinking about you both tomorrow as you start the

with taxotere so just know i am really behind in the bald department but will catch up sometime in late august can i whine about it then i will be sending good thoughts about no new and easy treatments for everyone tomorrow hope you all can sleep despite your steriods eileenr 56 congrats on getting close to the finish line i am only having 5 boosts i think so i am done monday or tuesday picture me doing my happy dance linda i am so glad you can eat a little my throat started improving the minute they stopped radiating my clavicle area so i am sure it was related bailey 1958 at the hospital i am at they have something called the 360 program where they give 5 free integrative treatments to cancer patients for me they suggested acupuncture for hot flashes and yoga for anxiety but they also offer things like counseling massage energy healing and other holistic medicine as part of the program i actually am saving my 5 visits so i can try the acupuncture for hot flashes when i go on tamoxifen i was having horrible hot flashes from the chemotherapy induced menopause they finally improved but i am expecting them to come back with a vengeance on the tamoxifen i am scheduled to start that as soon as i am done with rads i think we should definitely find start a hormone therapy thread we have such an active group of women here is my experience my case is similar to yours except that i did not require any chemo or radiation treatment started taking tamoxifen in july 2009 and ended in july 1014 based on my situation my oncologist determined i could stop taking it having done so for 5 years but i will continue having annual blood work done for the next several years here are what i believe were my side effects sense of numbness in both of my calves i am a frequent jogger started within a few months after starting taking tamoxifen slight ringing in the ears started within a few months after starting taking tamoxifen but not 100 sure i can link this to tamoxifen weight gain put on about 18 pounds this occurred at about the year point strange but been told sometimes side effects to any medication kick in for many years now lost about 10 pounds of this slightly lowered sex drive but not 100 sure i can link this to tamoxifen i am 52 note my shin and calf pain reported above was attributed to a knee condition a torn meniscus in my right knee i had surgery on this in feb 2014 and all the pain is now gone hope this helps i took 4 rounds of a c over 8 weeks with little problem i had some queasiness that lasted days after each tx and after the last treatment my blood counts fell very low i spent a week in the hospital with an infection got iv antibiotics and two pints of blood i had to miss a round of chemo last thursday i had my first round of taxol which i was assured by my oncologist was and all hell has broken loose i was nauseous during treatment and could not eat or drink toward the end of the treatment i developed horrible abdominal pain i have secondary progressive ms and am usually in a wheelchair the recliners where i receive chemo are plastic vinyl and very uncomfortable i thought i would feel better if i could get into my wheelchair and move around more freely get home and lie down the severe abdominal pain lasted two days all of my toes were also numb my oncologist was not on call but one of her partners seemed confused as to why i would have this side effect but did say i could take lortab the lortab lowered the pain maybe 5 i have a high pain tolerance because of constant muscle spasms from ms but this was high on the pain scale when i spoke to my oncologist on friday she seemed amazed that i could have these side effects especially the numb toes so soon well i do saturday i woke up to find the abdominal pain had lessened but i had excruciating bone pain from the knee down and into my feet two lortab do not touch this pain i am unable to walk because of the ms but i usually stand to transfer and can take an assisted step or two at times like this the pain is unrelenting whether i am lying down or sitting up my toes seem to be less numb there is still some numbness but it is not complete across all toes as before my chemo nurse commented when giving me the neulasta shot the day after tx that i should ask for a lower dose of taxol chemo is given by body weight and i get it by the ahem barrel i was given tagament and benedril as along with decadron i wonder if i should receive something stronger for the stomach like protonics i have received this in the past during abdominal surgeries i do not have problems with acid reflux it appears i may also need to receive iv fluids the next day as i found it almost impossible to drink anything the first 2 days i can miss a few meals with no problem need to lose weight i am not a quitter but the pain is so unrelenting it is wearing me out tomorrow i will ask her for something stronger for pain but am also concerned about continuing this chemo if it has compounding effects i do not want neuropathy especially in my hands since i do not walk my hands are crucial to everything i do including hobbies like knitting please give me your advice feedback or experience with taxol many thanks bliss hello all yasmin i hope that you breezed through your second round today i had my second round yesterday it was quite eventful just a few minutes into the taxotere infusion i got a little bit of belly cramping then all of the sudden my head started feeling a lot of pressure and dizzy and my vision had white flashing fireworks all over i was breathing very heavily practically gasping my blood pressure and heart rate skyrocketed and my oxygen level dropped within less than a minute i was surrounded by three oncologists and several nurses i was given benadryl more steroids and they put me on oxygen most of it went away within a few minutes and all within an hour it was a very scary experience i guess i must have looked pretty bad because the nurses kept coming by over the next few hours telling me how much better i looked my husband said my face was bright red my oncologist said no more taxotere but i convinced her to let me retry after the nurse told me it usually works if they slow it way down and that i still had the benadryl and extra steroids in just in case i was scared but i just leave there not trying it again i want to do anything everything i canto end this cancer and it worked no problems the second time in hooray so mary please make sure they give the taxotere to you slowly even though you did fine the first time as a side note i think i am developing a bit of thrush on my tongue back towards my throat white and feels looks like something growing there is there any way to stop this before it gets any further or do i need yet another prescription toni welcome so sorry to hear about your grandson glad your daughter is better so tough when these things all fall so closely please check into for preventing easing neuropathy it has worked for me so far also you may want to keep your mouth very cold ice during infusion and the rest of the day i did the first infusion and developed no mouth problems i slacked off this infusion because i was wiped out after the allergic reaction and believei have developed thrush already i suggest you read the chemo shopping list on this site if you already it gave me great information thati put to use i agree that all so young 39 and breast cancer was the last thing on my mind i was always a very healthy activeperson and been hard feeling so vulnerable i only had 4 lymph nodes removed but am having lymphedema issues already from the forearm down in all though extremely grateful every day to be here for withmy kids and family everyone feel well and get a good sleep always so glad to have all of you shay i am so glad that i found this site and signed up to it i was on herceptin only post chemo fec from january 2012 for 9 treatments on a trial and just felt ill weird all the time this was following a lumpectomy so ill that i took a voluntary redundancy rather than face going back to work i was unlucky enough to get the c back so after the mastectomy in marchi am back on the herceptin having had 4 alongside chemo and just had of 18 and it is so to find that my cramps symptoms fatigue low magnesium levels unsteadiness etc are not that uncommon not just me and not alone thank you all for sharing your experiences and giving this girl a real boost lisagh start sucking on ice during your next infusion of taxotere it worked for me as far as the mouth sores it always work but worth a try also for constipation you should try a stool softener like colace when i really got blocked up i used metamucil but prior to that you might want to try milk of magnesia i use any of that stuff that makes you cramp up i would start the metamucil the day before i knew i would get constipated and stopped once things moved at a normal pace and movements dry my toenail is now off but toe is still numb from lydercane i was walking doing errands for the last hours hope it hurt too much later on i started abraxane yesterday just wondering how many people have lost their hair my doc said some do and some no real problems yet last night or today face flushing today some cramps last night bumping up thanks for the replies support lorieg the kind of pain you describe is common with taxol i just had muscle aches and not the bone pain but i heard from several who had bone pain during taxol hang in there i tried effexor soon after b c diagnosis since i was told to discontinue premarin and the hot flashes started up after 2 days i threw it in the trash it made me feel jittery and nauseated now that further down the road past surgery chemo rads and am now taking tamoxifen i decided to give effexor another try and stick it out longer this time been about 2 weeks and the nausea subsided i still feel slightly jittery but my sleep is not interrupted and the hot flashes are now very minimal but the main reason for this post is i thinkthe effexor ismaking me lose weight has anyone bumped up the dosage from and had complete hot flash relief i am considering asking for an increase to be completely free of hot flashes i have 9 of taxol this friday it seems to me that most of the side effects are temporary i had to take a one week break due to my rash i felt better for a week started the taxol again and started the aching that i had the first few weeks just not as bad i have some numbness in 2 of my toes but not my fingers now had a little in my fingers during first few weeks have a constant runny nose raspy voice went away after a few weeks rash went away with medrol dosepak have been doing radiation at same time not as much fatigue as i thought a lot of breast soreness underneath my breast fyi i was told to use neosporin which i did for a week and then when i asked about putting something over the sore spot so the skin stick together they suggested handkerchief or sock if they had thought to mention this to me when i first got sore i think it would have been nearly as bad i think for each treatment there needs to be a complete list of every possible side effect and what can be done for it take out some of the surprise welcome to all the newcomers waiting for the results from my assorted tests scans was somewhat nervewracking at least i was able to get a new baseline for my uterus ovaries cysts and hips spine forearm prior to starting tamoxifen and boniva respectively urine analysis culture negative so urethra irritation probably related to vaginal atrophy tvus cysts on both ovaries right cyst is about half the smallest dimension of my ovary endometrium thickening again but still thinner than last july suspicious area in cervical region supposedly nothing to worry about yet just continue monitoring dexa osteopenia in hips especially spine was borderline and forearm too shoulder pain impingement in ac joint due to chemo related loss of bone muscle cartilage modification in current and must use resistance band for exercises to strengthen shoulders especially the rotator been experiencing escalating fatigue which i hesitate to attribute to tamoxifen yet somebody in the neighborhood either got a new dog or is on a new schedule lots of barking during the middle of the night as well as during the day which also happens to trigger other dogs to join in tami k8sonny we think alike i too believe that quality of life is just as important as quantity i also have tried the gelatinized maca hoping it would help boost my libido and improve the hot flashes unfortunately all it did was cause me a lot of gas pains which added to my inability to sleep well at night it did give me a reved up feeling throughout the day which was neither good nor bad tried many other herbals which are supposed to improve menopausal symptoms but most did nothing for me only time they helped was when i tried a phytoestrogen formula earlier on in my first year of the perimenopausal transition it improved libido vaginal dryness hot flashes and my periods became regular again for awhile postmenopausal now for over a year and recently retried the same formula and it help know if tamoxifen is affecting things or if due to the further decline of hormone levels i usually sweat during a hot flash either unless just gotten out of the shower and hair is still wet or during the night when under the covers then awaken soaked sherry almost guarantee that exercise is the reason why flashes have increased for you because noticed the same effect myself when i slack off on the exercising madison a good question i think she must be mentally unstable absolutely right about wanting our children around positive individuals and not mean people knowing what i do now better she ride there but what a way to find out great about your veterinarian daughter my niece works at a horse farm grooming and caring for a horse in exchange for free board she gets to ride it whenever she wants in maryland and it would have turned out to be a closer drive but i wanted a trail ride for audrey also hard to coordinate with my schedule also on her way to becoming a veterinarian and a top college softball player thanks for the hug for audrey susan i heard of mobic but yes you have it right about effexor and cymbalta for various chronic pain issues i have i take cymbalta neurontin and soma daily i had additional pain when i went on the tamoxifen that i have before knees about the only place i hurting lol which improved over time of being on the cymbalta of course now my recon helping all my other issues so i take darvocet on the worse days the cymbalta pamphlet that comes with the prescription states duloxetine cymbalta may improve your mood sleep appetite and energy level and decrease nervousness it can also decrease pain caused by nerve damage cymbalta is also prescribed for fibromyalgia because of how it helps you sleep which is such a necessary component of controlling fibromyalgia pain because an snri it appears safe to take with tamoxifen as opposed to the like lexapro which may inhibit the metabolization of tamoxifen i also have a prescription for celebrex was on vioxx and bextra before they got pulled from the market but my stomach hurt so bad after i started on it that i feared the very rare but fatal stomach bleeding it can cause and it was right before my surgery so i especially want any problems i stopped taking it and started again the neurontin i take also helps with peripheral neuropathy and other nerve pain condition and has been shown to decrease hot flashes i still get them from the tamoxifen but definitely decreased i assume be much more frequent if i on the neurontin so sorry if this was tmi just want to be helpful and been living with chronic pain since my early 20 s so something become too educated about a link regarding the and tamoxifen for anyone interested not easy to read but you might want to scroll down to the paragraph that begins the bottom line then print it out and take it in to discuss with your doctor cy you sure manage so much with all coping with now a root canal of all things on top of it all yuck will be thinking of you this week and sending positive vibes for good scan results big hugs sister marisa cute pics candie i been watching gma and simply because of what i heard about it good for you sending them that email love for them to get so much mail about it that they address their ignorance do you think they would somehow i doubt it but we can hope margaret glad you enjoyed vegas regarding the mean woman today i like to think that people like that get theirs in the end like the vet who threw cat in the trash last week right in front of devon who is only 11 scary how insensitive so many people are another one to report to the bbb liz sorry to hear about your mil sweet dreams

your day was nice a link to the place audrey was supposed to ride the horse at today they supposedly let the rider get aquainted with the horse for an hour and then ride the trail for an hour and a half a bed and breakfast but they also do just trail rides supposedly it look nice well it for me hope all from a z have pleasant dreams and restful sleep hugs love charlene i had my 2nd treatment yesterday of tc plus herceptin i was there from 9am till pm today i feel a little fatigue went for breakfast and then home to a nap i have no constipation yahhhhh only because i changed my stemetil anti nausea meds to emend which actually gives me diarrohea much better than constipation i get my neulast shot today and then usually day is worse for me hopefully i will be able to tolerate all my se better this time as i know what to expect i hear herceptin gives flu like symptoms mysister is here to help me with my kids so yaaah mmc sorry i missed this the first time around i also had tacx 6 and had some real problems with edema swelling and stiffnessin my feet ankles and lower legs which persisted for weeks and weeks after chemo was finished my oncologist said it was not unusual with taxotere interestingly a friend who had even more severe edema with taxol was told it was not the taxol go figure and prescribed diuretics they were nearly useless it seemed to be simply time that helped that and a return to activity slowly but surely say it took from june to september for me i do still have joint stiffness but that may be more related to my autoimmune diseases hard to tell unfortunately the neuropathy in my fingertips that set in between tx 5 and 6 and thereafter has not resolved hope springs eternal though lisa i was on arimidex for about a year then switched to femara which i continued for about 3 years my hair had been so thick that my stylist was in the habit of thinning it slightly even after years of treatment i noticed in a photo that i had bald spots on top of my head and that been shedding a lot of hair without realizing that it growing back i went to my mo and asked for another thyroid thyroid he said male pattern baldness the ai and try rogaine i bother i gave it some thought and did some research and went back and told him i was not going to continue the ai at that point done 4 years and 3 or 4 months of one ai or another had an oncotype score of 9 had done acth taxol not taxotere 2 years of herceptin one of neratinib the trial and i am pretty sure i got the drug and had a bilateral mx hysterectomy and oophorectomy i was not going to lose more hair he gave me a scrip for tamoxifen but told me it was not the drug itself but the estrogen testosterone balance and that most assuredly lose hair on tamoxifen as effect of the changes are cumulative and progressive so that not likely you get a reversal of what is already gone so i bother with the tamoxifen either at this point i have pretty much halted the progress of hair loss but it stop falling out immediately and it never did grow back i use biotin which really helps but was not going to use the rogane my mo retired and the new one says he have argued with me either i am 64 now and 8 years from hair in question is gray warmly cathyedited to everyone gets thinning hair from the effect of the or tamoxifen the male pattern baldness thing is a good bit more than thinning and if you get it you always get it immediately i started while i was bald from my chemo and nonetheless grew a very thick and normal head of hair that was healthier than days the thinning became a problem for me in year 4 edi wow you always seem to have so much energy but now you have out done yourself must have been nice to get so much done outside in relative warmth followed by a lovely time with your dd and gd liefie hope you are pleased with your decision to prepare sunday dinner for friends and that being in good company will buoy your spirits nihahi sorry to hear about dd you were wise to get clear of that waiting room traii wait to hear about your adventures on phillip island taxol being particularly kind so far feel pretty flattened plus have rash on my hands and zapping bone joint pain all over guess those are common ses though hoping today will be the worst of it enjoy your sunday everyone gina i did act 4 ac and 4 taxol i have permanent heart damage from the ac which is controlled with meds and bimonthly muga scans i have mild neuropathy in my right baby and 4th finger and the ball and great toe of my right foot from taxol and i lost an assortment of nails lol i still get short of breath from time to time and i continue to have the attention span of a flea but all in all i actually weathered the treatments without too much adieu i had a lot of bone pain with dose dense taxol during treatment but that was probably my only real complaint besides looking like an alien i have some minor problems with my right thumb and index finger if i write too much or over use my hand peeling or chopping or any repetitive motion but that has been chalked up to the lymphectomy not chemo all in all i did ok and now the memories are starting to fade a bit the constant diagnostics for heart failure and bone mets give me the screaming from time to time but i am really trying to just keep on keeping on sometimes i get really really mad that my onc made me hit it with the big guns just to wind up in this predicament but then i remind myself it could be a whole hell of a lot worse my only real piss off is that my onc greatly downplayed the ac heart damage issue so i readily understand your concerns i wish you peace and ease in your decision making your post sent me back to my initial meeting with my onc where she said this is not good and proceeded to effectively scare the crap out of me i post much anymore because in a battle with my employer which has become all consuming lately but i wanted to send you and everyone else my very best wishes thank you all for your comments i do not know what is wrong with me i wake up depressed and go to sleep depressed yes a lot happened to me in the past year cancer myself death of my mother son got glaucoma and marriage problems but everything has settled out and is stable now i cry for no reason at all i feel like i am caught in a loop i have to take the ais to prevent recurrence and am too afraid not to i am afraid to take because according to the research i have done they all list hair loss as a side effect and i deal with any more hair loss etc besides what are some natural ways others have dealt with depression hugs ohilly i was switched to aromasin from tamoxifen because every joint i had hurt a lot i have done much better on aromasin i took it for months had some nausea before i read the instructions that say to take it with a meal that does help give it awhile and if the are not tolerable ask to switch apparently the all have different propensities for side effects and of course each of us get different side effects than one another ouote adjuvant endocrine therapy with ovarian suppression is used as an effective alternative to standard cytotoxic chemotherapy for premenopausal patients with breast cancer abcsg 12 is the first study to compare endocrine suppression with goserelin plus tamoxifen to goserelin plus an aromatase inhibitor anastrozole adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy zoledronic acid was included in two of the four treatment arms both to mitigate the marked bone loss associated with complete ovarian suppression and to explore whether the antitumor effects demonstrated previously in preclinical and clinical settings might translate into a longer time to disease recurrence and improved survival would the above reference not include menopausal women when you are on edocrine therapy tamox or ai and have ovarian suppression with shots or else you are menopausal right maybe i am not reading this correctly i did ask my onc today about zometa for prevention and he said it is not approved yet hmmm i need to ad that i am only osteopenic with almost 10 bone loss in the tail bone so far and have funky with a bone thingy but no mets dx god bless hey steph so sorry to hear this suckie news ugh i too had to go back on chemo after 4 months i hope they try xeloda on you so far starting 2nd cycle tomorrow so good my phantom liver pain is gone gone gone i get some nausea but take reglan immediatley let me know what chemo they are going to try friday i came in to find out how mri went oh good you had it so amy the no news is good news thing huh how all my regularly scheduled scans work i get sent for pet ct and bone scans every few months if wrong nothing is mentioned until my actual oncologist appointment if something is wrong the doctor calls me a weirdness on my last ct and pet scans made him call me to get an mri which is how i found out about the blood clot which is why i was told to stop taking tamoxifen then had special clotting panel blood tests the lovenox injections then put on coumadin and being forced into taking the damn femara now aromasin for cancer control anyhoo hopefully all still quiet for you no call from the doctor so you can enjoy your weekend and yeah wow you sure do have a lot of hair way more than me oh mine covers my whole head at least but still long enough to cover my ears oh my here we go again no i live in florida i live in new jersey shudder and i mention that i into traveling when i was healthy why i told you all to go on ahead and just make whatever traveling plans you all want to do without me the last time this idea came up hmmm ok so what else is going on here judy sounds like doing good cool so your birthday is coming up when is it well in case i miss it happy birthday in advance geri so your bf is 7 years younger than you a cradle robber too my pack rat is 4 years younger than me and sure he sign up for a girlfriend with cancer either anyway about that raising the flag issue dare i ask if um done anything special to help him along if you know what i mean when i wear out my pack rat really bad but have energy for more for instance i find that when i eat him alive he does just fine and i like to eat pack rat sausage anyway my favorite food heh heh heh oh and one more thing maybe my pack libido is generally higher than your but my pack rat is at a distance his lifestyle is ultimate chaos and we get together that often average is every weeks so maybe by then just so totally you know he came with me for my first chemo infusion but not for any of my other treatments scans or anything although we talk on the phone a couple times a week between visits and up to date and with me concerning my condition treatment etc you know a few visits back i actually suggested to him that maybe i ought to let him go so he could find someone young pretty and healthy and do you know what he said what would i want to do that for titan well in my opinion that pack rat is the sexiest creature on this entire planet how are you feeling now happy birthday betsy hmmm ok five days on the aromasin joints ache like worse crap feet really hurt when i get out of bed in the morning and sweating with the hot flashes is worse but so far none of the suicidally depressed mood swings and crying fits and except the other day when it was really hot and humid still able to take my daily walks they make me tired and i seem to make it up to the next level 3 full circuits of the lake in the park still stuck at 2 yet but on the other hand today i did laundry in the morning and went to the supermarket instead of driving i walked so i walked almost 4 miles today but of course i passed out on the couch for about an hour once i got home and ate lunch and another sims modder is making me some new skins special for my theme game also i have to design my own diet to lose this frickin weight all the diets already out there send me into fits of depression when i read about them because they list foods i like foods never even heard of foods i know how to cook require spending money and so on so working on that too been keeping records of what i eat and looking up how many calories in it so going to go on a diet but going to have to be one for me based on what i like to eat and how i cook and not cost me any more money than what spend buying food anyway i have no past experience with dieting because i was never fat enough to really need it until now all i had to do before was just not wear bathing suits or clothes and i was fine lol oh and you know that italian dinner i made last saturday for me and my pack rat 1 green 1 red 1 orange and 1 yellow pepper plus 2 onions 2 potatoes and 4 links of sweet italian sausage all sauteed in olive oil with garlic powder and oregano i had bought enough to make it twice so having it tonight too believe it or not it that fattening i was shocked when i toted up its calories earlier this week but the recipe 1236 calories total is good for 4 servings 309 calories per serving so off to cook it up eat one serving tonight and have the rest as leftovers over the next few days i found out that it goes beautifully with an egg for breakfast too what i did with the leftovers from sat night have a good weekend all and do anything i lena just read through 4 pages of posts and had ac 3 today so i am sure i will miss something chrys i too am on the red devil and i take the steroid the night before i take mine the day after for 3 days i am on the every two week schedule and have compazine zofran and ativan for nausea though after round 2 i only took the ativan at night to help me sleep my side effects have varied round one i was slighly nauseous like morning sickness and tired with a huge headache for about 5 days round two still a little nauseous and really tired one of the side effects of the red devil is mouth sours when the nurse pushes it in to my iv i have popsicles or ice chips i also have something called biotene mouth wash to help prevent them adriamyacin also leaves you with an increased risk for heart issues later why they do the echo for a baseline now before you start treatment jennifer sorry about your hubby prayers for a speedyrecovery for him i had svt during my mastectomy surgery and shortly thereafter follow up ekg and echo alert the docs to anything so they are thinking it was just the stress of the situation i almost got out of adriamyacin because of it madismommy i have them give me my pharmacy orders each time so i know what they gave me i compare them to what i got last time just to make sure you should ask for them if you get them prayers for no puking no one should have to go through that mary glad not shingles we can get those i had two really bad bouts of chickenpox as a kid so hopefully i have built up enough immunization from those guys sorry you are still going through that keep us posted on what the docs find i asked my nurse if the chemo would kill any would be cancer cells in the other breast and she said definitely yes someone had asked about the flu shot i just asked my nurse and she said she would find out for sure as there are different answers apparently to all who had tx this week thinking of you and hoping for minimal s to all that had their last ac yay great job ladies by the way our periods supposed to stop with chemo since going off birth control b c i am er mine have been crazy irregular and down right annoying ok remember who said what anymore off to take an ativan and get some rest hugs to all my august sisters thanks for asking about me ladies i go for a consult with dr tierney in a few days should know more after that i wil keep posted trying to get through last taxol ses no bone pain yet just real fatigued depressed and abdominal pain praying it will resolve fast my oldest 9 just found out she got 2nd place in her age group at the butterfly festival today for her artwork we there but her friend called to tell her she is so excited hello i started taking letrozole in january 2014 and have to take for 10 years over the next few months i received different brands there was no consistency even though i used the same pharmacy during these first few months i had a permanent headache as well as other side effects i talked to my oncologist about the headaches and was sent for a brain scan as a precaution the scan was clear my oncologist wrote to my gp to say that i should only be prescribed the femara brand by novartis the headaches disappeared but i still have other side effects such as fatigue dizziness bone pain etc i can cope with the other side effects but i could not cope with the permanent thumping headache it is a known fact that generic brands of letrozole differ not with the base medication but with the coating on the tablet not sure i want a cancerversary i know the date i was diagnosed i know my mbx date which is another significant date for me on my personal journey and i found a great deal of comfort in it i know my chemo start and end dates maybe change my mind later got some post treatment let down have i already talked about it trying to focus on my next goal of recon revision surgery in dec my mind keeps wandering to wanting my next blood test in dec at my last appt my onc told me my ca tumor markers went up during chemo when they generally go down i had no idea i was being tested for this and i even know what it was she told me not to worry as a tool my understanding is inflammation in general can increase the number i ask what my numbers were and right now i want to know until i get the next number i do anything about it right now anyway so for now focusing on getting healthy for my next surgery i was able to start tracking my calories again on wed exactly 2 weeks pfc stayed on track too i know only a few days but give up before i was done with 2 days in the past got lots more incentive now i feel better already less bloat i have noticed i need to sleep more i did start tamoxifen on wed as well i am terrified of gaining more as i have needed to drop weight for the past few years i did gain 10 pounds on chemo but those were the 10 pounds i lost after surgery i complain on thurs my pt gave me some more stretching and strengthening exercises it must have been too much for me as one of my lower back muscles flared up i think i scared her as this happened while i was with her so the chemo weakness from being more sedentary and my hypermobile spine are to blame i want to do more but my body is not cooperating just yet still need to take it one day at a time hang in there everyone michelle your daughter is awesome and thanks for sharing your pics this may or may not help but been freaking out re dizziness and fatigue thinking i have brain mets when the most likely explanation is that the sudden shift in hormones caused by zoladex is causing the dizziness and fatigue i guess what saying is that natural to go to with every lump bump and symptom but far more likely that those lumps bumps symptoms cancer sending good vibes to you tresjolie hang in there sister barbara good luck on your first taxol watch you really closely the first few minutes to make sure you have a bad reaction take some extra reading material or whatever they drip it really slowly the first time so be in the chair for quite a while or after the benadryl you may just have a really nice nap i get my txs every friday morning and yes definitely fuzzy on the head now hope it hangs in there through my remaining 7 taxols domegal thanks for the eyebrow advice vickilynn yahoo done it is clear your body said enough and luckily your onc listened i wait to hear what getting back to normal is like holly congrats on your last treatment this week i think the cupcakes are a great idea certainly never turned one down china blue on my 5th week of taxol and have just started to notice some occasional numbness in the fingers on my left hand i plan to let my onc know since he told me he would adjust the dose if nueropathy becomes a problem he also told me side effects are called side effects for a reason they the goal of the treatment we want them to happen and we have ways of making them better so always let me know i immediately said okay how about some hair he replied uhh sorry i help you there drat patty hi urbie i noticed you were diagnosed in like me i was idcstage one cm er pr her i completed 4 rounds tc radiation therapy two years of tamoxifen now on femara i still feel fatigued everyday and need to nap i sleep well due to menopause hot flashes etc are you still fatigued it is very discouraging to me elliegurl susie i also had the rash i was on taxotere not taxol but they both can allergic reactions my onc prescirbed a cortisone cream for the rash have her call and ask about getting one are they giving her benadryl along with the chemo that seems to be a standard practice i take benadryl so that might be the reason i ended up with the rash good luck to your friend and god bless you for being such a caring friend hihas been a while but i have a few questions my onco wants to switch me from tamoxifen to arimidex i have been on the tamoxifen for years had side effects but they have pretty much subsided a little weight gain no sex drive but other than that tolorate it pretty well my questions are 1 do you go through and have a new batch of side effects from the arimidex like hot flashes again 2 if so how long before they appear and subside he wants to see me in 3 weeks to check how i am doing 3 do you finish out your five years of hormone therapy or will they keep you on it longer i have been looking forward to being drug free in another years think i can stand it much longer 4 is there any hope for the sex drive on arimidex thanks danm joni i was hoping taxol would have been easier for you much easier and that you would get a break the eye thing stinks and that is unbelievable that you had to do an mri for the facial numbness i know much about the inkso illneed to look into that prior toany future mris i have not had facial numbness i did and still do have nose bleeds the neuropathy started around taxol 6 or so and comes and goes two weeks out post tx its manageable after the lasttx i was wiped out though i been that tired in a long time also i got sick with a cold and am stil fighting it i really want to take antibiotics and so far its been getting much better all sinus stuff is clear so i think ill be ok i just worry about all the nasty things going around right now my hair is about a half an inch all around my head it started growing on tx taxol 7 and stopped i read about hair loss after taxol as well but i think it is different for each person im starting to get a wave in it look out have a great holiday to everyone tori as a piece of advice for the chemo there is an older nurse with a shortcut mostly white hair try not to get your treatment done by that one the only one who is totally out there she doesnt seem to care a bit and do her job too well there are two male nurses they are the best and of them two ryan is the best of all you can go in and ask for a specific nurse to administer your treatment and watch you what been doing they have ice chips there make sure that you get that going on at all times get some frozen peas bags for your toes and fingernails and use them when they start with the taxotere also i had used the sucking on the ice chips method when taxotere was administered i have mouth sores but still had the burned mouth thing at the last treatment i said what the heck i be able to taste anything for a week so i went ahead and asked my boyfriend to get me some fries from teh nearby mcdonalds a little bit down the road on portland a couple blocks south on the west side of the road and i ate my fries while they were starting the taxotere i have any burned mouth ask for them to start the taxotere on a slow drip and increase it slowly when they put it fast you will most likely have a nasty reaction i have just completed my 2nd round of taxol after completing 4 rounds of ac with not too many side effects and nothing that was debilitating i thought the taxol would be easier but my body says differently i had terrible muscle aches and pains 3 days after and lasted for 3 days 9 out of my 10 fingers are black already and i am praying that i loose all the nails i have had a little tingling in my feet and hands but that seems to be mild so far i have had terrible thrush and i have gotten this itchy rash on my hands that i have to use cortisone cream on my mo says i may not be able to complete the 4 rounds of dose dense taxol curious if anyone switched from dose dense to weekly and did that help hi after reading these posts i feel i might have something to add i have had severe bone pain since finishing my chemotherapy t c x 4 i was literally hurting all the time especially my feet i finally went to a podiatrist because my oncologist listening to me or care she just kept saying the side effects of tamoxifen and your chemotherapy the podiatrist said i have peripheralneuropathy he gave me a rx for neurontin my life was to the point that even standing at work for a few hours was horrible i walk very much and instead of the hikes i used to take with my dogs and the stuff i used to do i was reading painting writing pretty much anything that allowed me to sit although i like doing those things i felt depressed because it seemed that after cancer treatment my life had come to a stop when it should have been going forward full speed i know if that will help but it has helped me neurontin hugs to all of you teri raro what is the name of the orange ointment i was treated with taxol took vitamin b6 during treatment and had numb tingly toes i thought this was because my feet were coldi have poor circulation in the extremitiesbut now that april i wonder if it might really be neuropathy i will ask my oncologist about trying the b6 again but i know if it works after the fact i was told it could help prevent neuropathy i would like to have a backup plan to try in case it work a month after my diagnosis of bone mets i asked my onc for antidepressants i was crying every day and want to live that way i asked for and she gave me wellbutrin prior to the mets dx been on tamoxifen for 5 years and it had completely destroyed my sexual response i had done some research and knew that wellbutrin could have some positive effect on the sexual response issues so i specifically asked for that since my first diagnosis of stage 1 cancer back in 2004 i have had a prescription for ativan an med i find my worst moments are often after 10 pm my husband refers to this as my morose hour the ativan is good at bedtime and helps me get to sleep on those nights when my mind runs wild and i turn off the scary stuff a shrink been seeing asked me whether the wellbutrin had improved things and i answered it was hard to tell because i started taking it at a time when i was in crisis mode now that i am 7 months into the bone mets dx i am still trying to come to terms with what living with this is supposed to mean i have good days and bad days but there are few days when at some point during the day the whole experience of having mets weigh on me and make me sad coming to realize that for me at least this just comes with the territory people keep telling me gee you look great which is nice to hear but they see me on bad days because i go out when i feel lousy and i also keep hearing about how much people say they admire my strength and courage and again while i appreciate that they see me when bawling my head off behind closed doors i wonder how much the fact that i have had an instant chemical menopause has a role in the sadness they put me on lupron when i was first to shut down my ovaries in order to be able to give me femara at 50 i that far from menopause in any case but the fact at having it come on suddenly and abruptly has been rough at times right now i find everything is more intense the good times and the bad times i am trying to keep in mind pema advice she is an american woman who became a buddhist nun and who has written some great books she talks a lot about how change is constant and the sooner we stop trying to hold onto things and just relax with the idea that there is nothing to hold onto that is probably not a great articulation of her ideas but the best i can do at the moment the sooner we will be able to understand and accept uncertainties till i get that far i will continue to take the wellbutrin one positive thing about being off the tamoxifen is that my sexual response has come back somewhat whereas it is not what it used to be since it was down to zero i find this to be a great improvement ask your onc for those meds there is nothing noble in suffering for sake i had more side effects from tamoxifen femara is so doable i have slight joint pain in the morning with tamoxifen i had excruciating joint pain i rarely had periods while on birth control pills which i stopped the day i found my lump but i started getting them again on tamoxifen kcb surprised yourgp said you have to worry about birth control 49 and and my mo gave me a lecture about a woman who got pregnant on tamoxifen she was early 40s it does seem really silly for me to be using birth control at my age but my mo did that fsh lh test and says i amnot menopausal and until i go a full year without periods she thinks i need to continue with birth control i considered the menopause option remove or irradiate ovaries primarily for the birth control side effect but apparently the drugs aromadex cause even more hair loss than tamoxifen and i think the results are necessarily any better i think she plans to switch me to aromadex once i go through menopause lorbgo last chemo was april 21 so 6 weeks ago today hair growth is so different i started getting slight fuzz about 3 weeks pfc but still very thin fine hair that is gray or colorless no hair growth on taxol as some have gotten i was on dd taxol 4 treatments for 2 months hope your hair starts to show up soon it should my eyelashes and brows started falling out in earnest after chemo ended i guess they are on a different growth timeline than head hair waiting for the growth spurt it should be soon jeanieb 2 you are not whining that sound like fun at all i find with taxotere that it hits me about 3 4 days after infusion i have the dizziness but i do have nausea and last two times one episode of vomiting each time during the night coincides with onset of diarrhea feel like eating or drinking taste is altered i have also been very tired and it will hit suddenly may be out and running errands or having lunch with someone and all of a sudden total exhaustion this time the diarrhea started the day after no nausea or vomiting yet though hope avoided that find the muscle and joint aches started the day of and are continuing today walking like a very old lady sending hugs hope your scans show no further need for more taxotere after the treatment on the 20th badmamajama the answer is yes what feeling is very common thought share something with you thati posted onone of theher 2 threadsa few months ago introduce myself my name is sandy and iwas dx with her 2 er pr bc infeb 09 at age 45 i read everything i could find about this type of bc and treatment in order to try to gain some control over what was happening admit eventhough we are lucky enough to have herceptin the whole her 2 thing continues to be a worry in the back of my mind i was pushed into chemopause quite abruptly and still am and then the sleepless nights set in i dealt with a pretty bad reaction to taxotere which has left me with physical and psychological to date it was tough but i plugged along and thought i was gettingthrough okay it was january of this year when the fatigue of tx and still not being able to stay alseep at night really started to take toll on me during this time the anxiety consumed me and pushed me into a serious depression i know what was happening to me had no frame of reference to recognize or deal with this and consequently tried to keep it inside because of the shame and guilt i was feeling afterall other than herceptin active tx was done so i should be feeling better right wrong luckily for me my gp and oncology team saw it in my eyes and rounded up the troups very quickly to try to help me i found out that not crazy norwas i alone in this dark place these feelings are common and there are people and meds availableto help us get through and regain control of our life still in the midst of this battle but i do see the light finally i just wanted to share my experience in order to let others know that they are not alone and okay to ask for help i read something recently depression is not a sign of weakness rather a sign that you have been trying to be strong for too long best to all my her 2 sisters out there and thanks for listening sandy hi bekah been lurking and i hope ok that jumping in i saw your post asking for comments about weekly taxol and since i finished weekly taxol herceptin last month i thought maybe i could chime in not in exactly the same boat as you since i do the ac first but still see the good news is that i had no nausea or vomiting and the other taxol patients at my infusion center either i also had no muscle or joint pain but i usually got a pretty nasty headache two days out advil could handle it though so really not so horrible i only had one toenail that was affected at all even though i ice anything a couple of times i had mild tingling of the fingers and toes and one of the things my oncologist and the nurses asked about all the time for me it mostly went away a couple of days after treatment one toe is still a bit numb but not much of a bother hair though the rough bit i lost pretty much all of it after the third treatment my oncologist said all his patients lost their hair on weekly taxol brows and lashes were fine until now darn it all through all 12 treatments brows and lashes held on now though falling out argh near the end i had a couple of minor allergic reactions to the taxol the nurses said that was pretty common i got a red rash all over my face and i had to postpone a treatment it itch or anything i just looked like i had a bad sunburn they loaded me up with benadryl and decadron oh joy and had me use an otc cream until the end of it i rinsed with baking soda salt three times day and never got a mouth sore with the herceptin every three weeks had no noticeable side effects hope this helps holly hi luckydog i had a lot of neuropathy on taxol also what my mo did was delay my chemo 1 week to give my body a chance to heal a bit more before hitting it again and then when i went back for my next taxol she reduced my dosage by 15 my mo took it pretty seriously and said stop the taxol if the neuropathy improve with the extra week off and reduced dose but it did so hopefully your doctor will listen to your concerns my mo said one way they can judge if the neuropathy is too much is if it goes away before the next treatment which for me was every 2 weeks so if the neuropathy was bad the 1st week but got better the 2nd in time for next taxol then it most likely would not be risking permanent kendra hi my doctor prescribes a vitamin d and it did absolutely nothing to help with joint and bone pain from femara which is a similar drug to arimidex i would do more research on this topic i have always used vitamin d prescribed or not i have joint or bone pain while on arimidex i am not certain why it is not a given that you will have this side effect yourself one never knows what the side effects of a drug will be until one uses it best doris in the chair thursday for my first taxol very nervous onc says fatigue will be same level as a c plus bad bone pain and total hair loss after 2 weeks still have my cough cold think on day 11 of that all in all not the best week for me cold has made ses come out in droves even this late after treatment of course i helped matters as been very busy this last week because i am usually pretty se free at this time so when i plan all that extra stuff i do during week 1 post treatment live and learnbtw i am constantly asked if the chemo is working i am also asked about chemo side effects i tell them fatigue and nausea think people really want to know about the other 50 or so ses i get one day going to write them down so i can look back and be truly impressed with myself angie really sorry to hear about your cellulitis i hope it gets under control soon with you all in not feeling too attractive right now gaining weight during chemo seems like an insult i had already started with an extra pounds so need another 4 oh well i guess small potatoes compared to all the other things they are giving me a blood transfusion tomorrow in addition to my taxol i feel a little nervous about that but they say it will make me feel stronger after tomorrow only two more treatments and then a 2 month break before surgery really looking forward to those two months i want to exercise and do acupuncture and cook and go away for the weekend and eat big salads and be less cranky with my husband and kids and not have tingling fingers and toes and hopefully not spend too much of it stressing about my surgery hello ladies just checking in catching up etc looks like everyone is doing great windgirl you look fabulous so jealous of your travels gatomal bippy you look wonderful too so fun that you got to meet in person spend a little time and happy belated birthday bippy you share a birthday with my brother hope you had a great day had a whirlwind few weeks and switched meds yet again during that time as well see went home to mo for a week for work and to visit the folks friends then back for a week and a half during which i did a partial bathroom remodel sink vanity area only which made me feel great i love diy home improvement it gives me such a feeling of accomplishment when done and i enjoy the results so much more than if i had hired out the work then i went to tn for 2 weeks w my bff to help her clear out her house who passed away from stage iv lung cancer in april ended up bringing back a new kitten from tn like there are not enough orphan kittens here in az her mom was such a cat lover and the kitten called out to us while we were walking one evening and literally followed us back to the house we both felt her mom had a hand in it so bring ourselves to take her to the humane society since my friend had already taken in her 3 kitties and already had 2 of her own i was elected and since i just lost my beloved mooch a few months ago we had a vacancy the next weekend which was this past weekend we did a climbing camp out weekend with our scout troop i went and repelled both days but climb as i feel my balance upper body strength is still lacking but will definitely do it next time i feel like i have something to prove if that makes any sense it was great fun seeing the boys progress from fear of going over the edge to thirst for conquering the rock and racing to the bottom so i have now switched from exemestane to anastrozole to tamoxifen the joint pain was bad on exemestane nearly unbearable on anastrozole but greatly improved on tamoxifen so far i also feel like sleeping a bit better finally unfortunately there are a couple of other side effects not enjoying so much mainly crabbiness most afternoons i turn into a raging lunatic start snapping at my dh also the hot flashes hoping my crazies moderate as time goes on they say some of these se may lessen over time fingers crossed i think i am out of options if tamoxifen work for me my hair is growing back thick and curly also but mostly grey i had it trimmed up once several weeks ago but felt like it was too short so now back at that awkward stage of growing out where i do anything with it i like the curls and am about to decide to dye it back to like it was before now that finally starting to feel more normal i want to look more like my old self i think on my work computer so no pics but will post one of the new kitty later hugs to everyone pinkribbonlady i undertand your fear but as read the above posts hopeful that you are much less afraid after many years on been on xeloda fulvestrant taxotere gemzar and now on doxil the worst for me have been neuropathy and some foot problems never been nauseous though do have to deal with bathroom issues one way or the other and i always just have to wait and see what going to be lost hair on taxotere but not on gemzar or doxil fatigue of course has been an issue so learned to take advantage of when feeling energetic and rest when tired when i get a scan that says my ca is stable or ned worth any from chemo good luck and let us know how doing i was on arimidex for a year before the ses became and earned me a two month drug holiday within 8 weeks all my ses went away then i started femara in august 2013 i was amazed that i did so well in january on the referral of my mo i started seeing an acupuncturist even though i suffering the extreme joint pain i had on the arimidex i did feel that the weekly acupuncture was definitely helping me feel looser all over well in march i got called for jury duty then i got sick then the schedule got backed up and long story short i went 7 weeks without a treatment man my joint pain and stiffness came back with a vengeance i finally got in to see her on friday she inserted one needle in my head right side that hurt so bad she had to remove it after only five minutes it was in the meridian connected to the hands and fingers hmmmm the middle trigger finger on my right hand has worsened considerably and the arthritis in my ring finger is swollen and starting to be fixed in place talk about blocked energy for me this is more proof that these acupuncture treatments do work on joint pain and stiffness from the ais fortunately kaiser has kept track of several clinical trials on this and now offers it as a covered benefit worth a try hello princesses michelle glad that the

have to go fill the prescription today so i forget rossileo be the brave one if you go out with the buzz cut look in public i think i will dye it purple first can always just wear wigs until it grows out ladyboss the truth on the tamox and weight gain is that there really is no difference it is not really the tamoxifen it is the fact that going through a sort of menopause if you are an exerciser and sensible eater be fine if you are a couch potato struggle with the typical weight gain for women who go through menopause your choice had cancer 3 times but this is my first post to any forum first one right breast was stage 1 had lump removed all lymph nodes from under right arm removed radiation and 5 yrs tamox this was about 15 years ago had yearly mammograms which remained clear until 2 years ago when 3 tumors showed up on left breast totalling nearly 5 cm had several positive nodes so nodes removed left side stage 3a had lumps removed radiation and now on arimidex left surgical scar reopened after radiation and is still open 1 year later mamo in april 2008 was clear both sides finally had a mri in november which showed potential issue on right breast after an biopsy they confirmed cancer again 1 cm less than 2 years after last one have decided on bilateral mast in 3 weeks with no reconstruction estrogen appears to be my issue also as all 3 cancers have been er unclear if the cancer in the right breast was present all along and perhaps missed by earlier scans i have a supposedly unrelated condition with leiomyomas all over my body genetic condition and a hysterectomy at age 28 due to fibroids the arimidex has weakened my bone structure and a simple fall last january resulted in a broken wrist and broken knee cap am on large dosage of vitamin d still working full time and feel reasonably good but this is getting old looking forward to taking a vacation even though the economy sucks after 3 cancers time to relax and enjoy life luckily my cat and bone scans are clear so no mets yet at 59 really glad my husband and i traveled a lot to wonderful places over the years if you wait until you retire betting be in great health and i would have lost that bet with no lymph nodes either arm infection and lymphodema are continual risks have had infections on left side twice in last year one resulting in hospitalization have stage 1 lymphodema and will start wearing sleeves and gloves do daily arm and left exercises with weights want it to get worse had blood pressure taken in either arm for nearly 2 years i have cysts on both ovaries that they will probably remove later in the spring however things could be a lot worse make it reasuring to see the posts of many women who have had bilats as well as 2 3 or even more bouts of cancer spirits seem good and people keep on keeping on glad to have found this site good luck to you nancy and others one of the first se i noticed from arimedex was insomnia i took my tamoxifen at night due to nausea so did arimedex the same within a couple of weeks i decided to move it up to late afternoon and then went to lunchtime the problem got better i take it now about an hour after i take the venlafaxine to help with depression and hot flashes and insomnia is much improved now a question does anyone have stiffness and some pain in their hands and fingers this has just started in the past two weeks usually disappears within a few minutes after i get up concerns me since i play the piano have a restful evening everyone god bless all of you with peaceellen hi mary welcome like you i had her 2 times 3 which meant i had triple the usual her 2 cells i had taxotere herceptin and perjta every 3 weeks for four months the se were tough nausea achy severe diarreah but i made it through i have my surgery until after chemo then i had 33rads which i finished last week i have been getting the herceptin infusion every three weeks since i finished chemo in dec and am not having any problems with it maybe a little more tired the next day but i was and continue to be so tired from first the surgery then the rads that i be sure if the tiredness the next day is from the herceptin or not good luck with your treatments welcome back diane anne chelev if you find my mojo please send to me if anybody has a cure for vaginal dryness please let me know this is really making me crazy the whole bit about rads just makes me crazy frying your heart deni good grief i also had a left side tumor i hope everything is okay cripes i stand it deanna well the osteopathic endocrinologist asked me about my symptoms from tamoxifen she was not sure yet how to handle the vaginal dryness which is why i asked above i also asked about progesterone creme she mentioned going to look at the estrogen results and see there first makes perfect sense to me she was like one thing at a time i just feel so glad to have found somebody i can finally work with on this stuff i mentioned to her they would likely want to switch me to an ai from tamoxifen in years and she said well talk about that i smiled inside i do want to talk about it i just know the oncologists will scare me my tumor was large i had vascular invasion and i have a fantastic response to chemo which also makes me crazy why we test these friggin tumors prior to chemo no we just blast everyone with chemo hoping it shrinks the tumor ugh this just blech i am going to start focusing on how much angst i feel about the upcoming surgery so i can stop focusing on the dumb rads and chemo lol spring obxk hi there so sorry you are having a second round of just sucks we share the same birthday though i am a little bit older i had 6 rounds of tc and had to stop the last taxoterebecause i had a n alergic reaction my ca was normal too at dx glad you found us here stupidboob there is nothing i can add accept that i took my neulasta shots in the belly and they never gave me any side effects i took mag 07 for constipation and it made all of my chemos much easier to deal with most of us do chemo is the only weapon for and alternatives are not was doing all sorts of alternative things and got no response chemo was the only thing that worked and surgery took out the remains you can do this i need advise 51 have been on tamoxifen for 3 years initially had bad hot flashes vaginal dryness etc but these ses are gone now over the 3 years of tamox periods got more and more scarce had one for 5 months now so today my new onc switched me to aromasin he said that the clinical definition for post menopause is 6 months without a period i thought it was a year and so close sure ready to switch he is doing blood work to confirm this hormonally anyway after reading about all the side effects of aromasin having second thoughts how much better is aromasin than tamoxifen at reducing the risk of reccurance i had stage 1 idc lumpectomy radiation only 15 er positive and 60 pr positive so there was some question how effective hormonal therapy would be anyway is it worth switching or is this a if not broken fix it situation so confused i think pet scan andor bone scan with contrast is probably the most reliable test of mets to bone femara and or other drugs of that type casue severe pain in some people as well i took myself off from the femara after 3 months and felt better almost immediately there are other ways to combat estrogen in the body just a word of encouragement that i fail to see in this thread is ladies i know we all tend to worry from time to time but please take the time to research some holistic approaches to health in general and claim that you are healed if you are a christian put yout trust in god if you are not try to find whatever is your source of strength and healing all lift each other up and send all good energy to each other prayers peace and healing to all you all deserve to be healed depression and stress related to breast cancer diagnosis and treatment is real pain from treatment surgery chemo rads hormone stuff etc is something we all go through i wanted to share my experience with antidepressants and what has really helped i was on paxil for a number of years after my treatment etc anxiety totally ran my life after the stage iii diagnosis additionally i was suffering from chronic shingles and pain from the arimidex a friend of mine suggested cymbalta cymbalta is an antidepressant it treats depression anxiety and nerve pain usually prescribed for diabetics because it helps with the neuropathy well i switched from paxil to the cymbalta and i have to say that it really helped the nerve pain that i was experiencing from the shinges and most likely left over from the taxotere just wanted to share this info the depressive symptoms seem way less as well joycey it is crap and the nights are the worst i too keep questioning the benefits my oncotype was 12 so do i really need this but then that means i have an 8 chance of recurrence after tamoxifen and that the arimidex cuts that in half i am backed into a corner i get schatzi what a nightmare i am sorry that you had to go through all that you described jeez trisha i agree with you we have to eradicate the beast and i am on board with this treatment but now and then i have to complain a little there are days when i think i will call the onc and demand to go on tamoxifen my husband thinks that i only got my bc because i took hrt and that now that quit it i have nothing to fear hah not suggesting that i quit arimidex but his view on that annoys me bc just that simple i have always had a high tolerance for pain had endometrial biopsies without the benefit of painkillers or anesthesia so i think a tough cookie but arimidex has been a real challenge i broke my left arm in side as my lumpectomy that i now have such severe pain in my shoulder in the morning that it brings tears to my eyes been to the orthopedist have gone through physical therapy but the shoulder pain is awful now i also have it on the opposite side only milder once up and moving around it improves but if i reach for something a killer i let the pain stop me i keep moving my right knee gives out it was and the doctor said it was perfectly normal i have lost some of the strength in my hands my fingers are stiff but at least they hurt badly but i need help getting the cap off a water bottle i used to lift a heavy wing chair by myself and carry it across a room or move heavy planters around in the garden always been strong now i have balance else have those listed in the side effects not dizziness i just find myself losing my balance kind of staggering to the right a little bit occasionally happened twice today if i get down on the floor to do a project and try to get up again the pain in my knees and is debilitating and i need to pull myself up with arms by grabbing a table or a chair but on the bright side so far after nine months of arimidex no weight gain i am a small so weight is not contributing to my inability to get to my feet pain is interested in the neurontin someone mentioned that it helps the pain i worry about it interfering with the effectiveness of the anyone know more about neurontin gabapentin curcumin is surprisingly helpful during the day but the nights that do me in no matter what i take for pain if i get up in the middle of the night i walk like quasimodo from the hunchback of notre dame if i had to quickly get up and evacuate the house for any reason i would probably tumble down the stairs still in my fifties and a year ago prior to my diagnosis i was light on my feet and dashing everywhere i have to fly occasionally for work that i do i now allow myself a recovery time upon arrival so that i can be fresh for my meetings i find that if i do that for myself i am just not at my best best being a relative word we are having a bad winter of snow has anyone noticed a seasonal difference in the side effects of arimidex my hair has not changed noticeably i use oil of olay definity on my face so my skin changed at all on my face and neck i hope oil of olay have estrogen in it my legs and arms look a little crepey my thyroid is enlarged it was biopsied at the time of my dx due to nodules and was fine but i am concerned about to do comprehensive bloodwork my one year mammogram is scheduled for early april i just got checked out by my radiation oncologist and she said everything looked great so maybe i complain one thing i recommend for any ai sex life is coconut oil after nine months on arimidex my fairly recent discovery of coconut oil has made sex feel just like it used to no kidding sorry to hit you with the entire saga oh and does arimidex make add worse hi karebear and angel just stopping by to see how things are i am relating to the sore port especially if i lay sleep on that side funny or maybe overexert myself lifting things like hevy groceries after my taxotere on thursday i unexpectedly got very sick to my stomach i never have had that happen before i have been super tired this time around and achy a little sad now i am at the back of the line of all of you but happy for everyone that they are almost done i can also see the light at the end of the tunnel i still have 7 weeks to go i have had teeth sensitivity too i think i am gaining weight i am as hungry as a horse it must be the steroids today at least i had lots of fresh fruit in the house and ate lots of it a whole cantelope had my name on it o hope everyone is enjoying their weekend cathy hi deb no nausea at all so far hopefully i jinx myself my onc has told me the taxol really have much nausea associated with it it is more symtoms who knows i am feeling it a bit more but like i said i am on 7 though however i missed any work or anything i have really wanted to do the last seven weeks i basically just look like crap and feel tired it could be worse cristl had first tch today easier than i feared it would be using emla cream helps alot loved having the port so many bags of meds first up herceptin after tylenol pills and iv benadryl then herceptin after those premeds then goes anti emetic meds iv aloxi and emend up then goes taxotere i did put glove ice packs on my hand and feet during taxotere just on nail bed areas hope it helps feel a little what is probably heartburn in reading posts and no appetite no nausea but feel like eating anything i did drink an ensure lucky me on decadron for both taxotere and extra day for nausea have been warned will be tougher when steriods are stopped go back for neulasta shot tomorrow afternoon will take my claritin daily for that onc office recommended that too for a week today was better than i thought six and a half hours at office total for lab draw pa visit chemo wondering what the next few days will bring hoping for the best lisabilat mx 11 idc 2cm stage 1 sentinle lymph node negative er pr her 2 oooohhhh taxotere i think it makes adriamycin seem like aspirin i had all the se especially the fluid retention in my upper body and face i gained 25 lbs in 6 weeks and ate only sugar free banana popsicles i thought i had lympedema but it was just retention my arms were so swollen i could barely move them my onc said she was surprised as well but go to the taxotere side effects and it is all there so why are they so surprised it took about weeks for the weight to come off then my taste came back and i put on a few lbs enjoying all the foods i could not taste for 4 months i am about 5 lbs over my weight but i have not been able to work out much still have a lot of fatigue from the tax my onc said it would take a year to get back my strength if i really go one day i am bed the next two it is so hard to take it easy when i am feeling good with taxotere i had severe edema severe leg pains took hydrocodone excessive eye tearing extreme fatigue breathlessness loss of taste burning and numbness in my feet and fingertips abdominal bloating and just generally felt like crap 3 months later i feel about 90 better i was told taxotere would be so easy and for some women it is i just had a really bad time again but begged for my last tx because it is so effective for triple negatives it was a rough road but it is barely a memory now hang in there it will come off it just takes time i had bought a pair of pink jeans and when i put them on they were way too big i went from 144 to 169 and am now at about debbie my onco told me that tamoxifen definitely slows your metabolism as i was complaining about weight gain too i am very active and a good eater but it just enough trying to incorporate more liquids to keep me full and eat slower hang in there about 7 months out from last tch chemo and my nails are just about back to normal still a little brittle and thin but never had very strong nails and i think the herceptin which i just finished also affects nails it just takes time i had emend in pill form i took the first pill before chemo and the next 2 for the 2nd and 3rd day after chemo i found that watermelon really worked for nausea and the sugar helped when i eat anything i had the dose dense a c t and found i was extremely nausious and felt awful for the a c part and was better on the taxol i ate a lot of mashed potatoes and found which days my taste buds were off so eat bland stuff i really tell the difference between hot and cold so i had to be careful with soups and things that they to hot you will figure out what works for you and total trial and error hi been taking letrozole for a couple of months i have also had dry mouth and have been feeling weak and tired have started doing gentle yoga to try to strengthen my body and hopefully to keep osteoporosis at bay worst of all had the most awful urticaria hives and itching all over my body it has got to the stage where i cannot sleep at night hence this post it has been so dreadful i have actually stopped taking the stuff for the past three days in the hope of having a little respite and sleep and am going to ring the hospital tomorrow for an appointment i am of course really worried about doing this but felt i was going mad with this side effect now i am anxious about the lapse and i have made partner worried too i have been up all night reading dr susan love and trying to compare other aromatase inibitors i will call the hospital tomorrow and get an appointment asap anyone else had this side effect best to i was diagnosed april 2006 with tubular carcinoma right breast just under a cm no lymphnode involvement but chose mastectomy no chemo or radiation ordered however i have lived a tamoxifen nightmare for three years called my oncologist last month and begged to take a day break at my last week he agreed that after three years of use and due to the quality of life on tamoxifen i could choose to discontinue it bascially my side effects were chronic bone and joint pain fingers and toes knees elbows vaginal dryness peeling vaginal skin vaginal tearing shrinking itching infections hot flashes to the max insomnia blurred vision mental fog memory lapse depression i even tried effexor for four months and the nightmare got worse and for all of those docs who say these things are caused by chemo i disagree i did not have chemo unless you count the chemo pill tamoxifen and i still suffered these side effects my onc said that when tamoxifen was first prescribed they only ordered two years of it and somewhere down the line the medical community changed it to five years i know i took a risk in discontinuing but am hoping that my life will return to a somewhat normal state now that i have come off the drug i am wondering how long it will take for the side effects to ease or hopefully go away completely anyone else where i am i was on zometa for yearsat progressively larger intervals from every three weeks to every six months my doc wanted me to continue given that i was on femara which thins the bones but i stopped it because of joint pain after a 2 year break my onc finally convinced me to get it again six months later he switched me to tamoxifen now i probably be needing zometa but am not really sure zometa can stay in the bones for a long time hi ladies i been online for several days that facial swelling only that started developing last wed nite day after 1st taxol herceptin tx continued to get worse i woke up last friday am with the entire side of my face from just under next to my eye all the way down to my jaw swollen sensitive to touch or pressure so i called my office they said to come in at 1pm i figured go get looked over leave with some sort of prescriptionto get filled by the time i got there that side of my face had that reddish look to it well the nurse practitioner took a look at the swelling said she thought it was some sort of infection which is what it seemed to me too she wanted the dr to take a look too so my oncologist examined my mouth face then conferred with an infectious disease specialist at one of the local hospitals i have to admit that i been to a dentist in years have several teeth with issues the infection likely started or entered through one of them my guess is that because of the of steroids that just taken 20mg of decadron monday night another 20mg tuesday morning herceptin tx considering that steroids suppress your immune system that the infection took advantage of that opportunity to settle in spread next thing i know getting iv infusions of 2 antibiotics at the office while they decide what to do with me for the weekend decision was that i had togo to the hospital for iv antibiotics not continuous more like every few hours between the 2 meds but round the clock so i checked myself in friday night after getting groceries for my daughter for the wkend plus an emergency run to kmart for underwear since i was on my last clean pair of course packing a bag having a quick dinner thought be there til monday morning but was discharged sunday afternoon with a prescription for an oral antibiotic the swelling seems to have gone down completely but on the meds til i finish them which should be next wednesday i had been scheduled for tx 2 of taxol herceptin yesterday but my onc had me postpone the tx for a week so no tx this week i have an appt tomorrow am with the nurse practitioner for on my infected face hopefully be no surprises angie 27 congrats on finishing ac to answer your question i have any to the taxol herceptin treatment at least not the 1st one the only one had so far unless you count that opportunistic infection that set in for the 1st tx they had me take 20mg of decadron the night before plus another 20 mg a zofran two hrs before treatment they gave me the herceptin first preceded by 25mg ivinfusion of benadryl they did the herceptin over a 90 minute drip normally 30 minutes but they do it slower the 1st time then monitor you for an hour afterwards the monitoring time overlapped the taxol infusion so as not to make the appt even longer they gave me a second 25mg iv infusion of benadryl then the taxol i remember how long the taxol drip was i think either 30 or 60 minutes i have any reactions to either of the meds just felt sleepy from the benadryl i nappedon off for a few hours after i got home was fine after that went to work the next 2 days with no problems other than my swelling face i went to my knitting group wednesday night too felt fine stayed for the whole 3 hours plus hopefully tx 2 will go as smoothly hopefully your experience will be similar minus the facial infection though hi everyone this is the first time i am using this site my mom was just diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer to her liver her oncologist started her on herceptin and taxol so far the taxol is giving her a lot of pain in her feet and she is getting a lot of diarrhea as if cancer alone bad enough the side effects of the chemo just add on to what she has to go through is there anything she can do or i can do to help her through this her oncologist made it sound like she will have to be on this forever is she going to be better ever i just feel so aimless helpless and sad log in to post a reply marilyn how did your recon fail if you had infection or other issues that caused you to have your reconstructed breasts removed then it quite possibly could be scar tissue left over from that i know i have a ton of weird lumps around my reconstructed breasts this latest sabc had two studies that showed that femara is superior to tamoxifen in preventing recurrences i am but my onc wanted me on the femara because of the increased level of protection so i get lupron shots to put me in meno you can read about the results of the studies right here on the home page and click the link to research news i take my femara at night right before bed i get any side effects except that it helps me sleep i hope everything turns out ok isy longtime but i am glad you are well with abraxane sorry about the neuropathy lolll we are now neuropathy sisters i am using cymbalta since two months my neuropathy is better thank god i tried taking neurobion it is a b complex supplement but it work my pet was schedulled for monday but now it is put on hold till either tuesday or wednesday for lack of nuclear injection loll so i will wait few more days and of course i will post as soon as i get the results my onco did warn me about the neuropathy i play the guitar and a pastry chef so gonna keep a close eye on that know about the bloody noses my sinuses are already pretty irritated and dry i had some allergic reactions to cytoxan but hoping not something i experience blackened nails sound too appealing either compared to what just been through it all sounds pretty manageable just so relieved to already be half way done sandiddstn and jfv i also had a blm no reconstruction back in march i still have some tightness in the chest muscles and occasional soreness in my armpit but nothing that some ibuprofen relieve i stretch when it feels really tight and that always seems to help healing can be a slow process but i just try and think of how far already come instead of how far i have yet to go helps me stay positive all get there in our own time hi cannoli my tes are not bothering me too much did you do any physical therapy i think my pecs have stretched to the point that just more comfortable now i can sleep on my side roll over without a problem and i can hug without wincing regarding the taxol i would talk to your onc about not doing dose dense side effects are much milder when you do it weekly my np suggested calcium vitamin b6 and to help with the nueropathy and nail problems i skip the taxol throw the book at this beast do everything at least how i feel cici i had terrible heartburn in the beginning of my ac i started taking prilosec otc every day had a problem since maybe try something different than prilosec i also was on femara for 3 years and switched to tamoxifen because i am getting bad bone loss and the pain in my upper back is terrible now living on and they hurt my stomach tamoxifen since one 10 days and i feel awfull worst than femara joint pains i sleep at all even with melatonine and ativan i feel weak and nauseated i just hope these are side effects that will not last forever because i think i can cope with them too long glad you are both doing well on tamoxifen welga lauren i had a c before taxol and lost my hair at about 15 days i noticed it when i would tuck my hair behind my ears and it fell out in my hand instead i lose my eyebrows eyelashes with a c but now that on taxol losing those i counted 23 eyebrow hairs yesterday morning and now 16 this morning currently 22 days out on taxol hope that helps hi jane i had 18 weekly doses of taxol and 12 of avastin last year 3 weeks on and 1 week off i actually tolerated it very well until the last month or so carried on working throughout reduced hours to about 16 a week half way through held my father in 80th birthday at our house after the 3rd dose and coped with a party of 25 for the weekend they all stay with us continued to walk miles each weekend until the last month and even climbed 2 lakeland fells half way through slowly it really was only the last month or so that i felt very fatigued and as i said i still was able to keep on working had nose bleeds but think these were due most probably to the avastin rather than the taxol like jenny i lost several toe nails and my finger nails also lifted but fall off had some neuropathy in my fingers and toes as well affected my balance slightly particularly when doing my yoga class but now 5 months later the fingers are fine and the toes are nearly better lost my hair but it started growing back about of the way through so now have quite a good head of hair again i found taxol much easier to tolerate than the fec i had 5 years ago the fingernails were probably the worst thing for me and again they thought that might have been exascerbated by avastin causing bleeding under the nail obviously we are all different but just wanted to say i found it very best wishes k meme here is the thread had tch chemo i had no nausea because my onc pretreated w aloxi emend a boatload of steroids i did have constipation from all the anti nausea meds followed by camping in the bathroom from the big d i had tc every 3 weeks and herceptin weekly for 18 weeks then had the herceptin every 3 weeks to finish out the year when i went thru 4 yrs ago the standard of care for herceptin was a year i did have the h run over an hour each time at first they were 30 minute infusions but i was so achy i stand it i also had a nuelasta shot the day after each tc treatment i took clariton for the bone pain that i had hello ladiesi have been following the group from my email but i have not posted in a while i think of you ladies all the time and i still am laughing and crying with you all i am now seven weeks post chemo and started tamoxifen last week i do not know where to start football amazing i am jealous a small note about ports i had my port removed with my implant surgery chemo kills our veins please seriously consider leaving your ports in the morning of my surgery the first nurse could not get my iv started the second either the anesthesiologist get it they brought in a doppler and then an ultra sound machine after six attempt the second anesthesiologist finally got it last week i was really sick and went to my infusion center to get fluids and they hunted down the best nurse to put my iv in she worked in the building but not in the same center it took her three times this one little point was never told to me so i wanted to let you all know before you rush to remove your port i easily made the decision to have it removed i wish i had not ask your nurses neuropathy has slowly diminished but i have very weak muscles and can not do much so i am starting physical therapy soon fatigue still here i spoke with a thirteen month survivor and she told me it takes a good six months minimum to start to let up not happy about that tamoxifen my hot flashes are becoming less frequent but they are horrible when i get them i work at a laboratory supply company and one thing i do is research the researchers many women stop taking tamoxifen because of the side effects i am already very moody this fact has prompted a search for an alternative i along with many of you ladies have to take tamoxifen and i am not happy about it either i will take it as long as possible and i hope i make it through the whole five years i remind myself that this is a battle and i have to keep fighting all good days are in the future for us all hey everyone happy friday just popping in for a second because putting off exercising i know i know do itleesaann yes tamoxifen can definitely cause bone joint pain and weirdly it seems to cause a lot of foot bone pain mine toe pain comes and goes like paula said we are all so different just no telling how it will affect you i could have gone with an ai or tamoxifen but chose tamoxifen because i heard it causes less joint pain than an ai and that was important to me but yes i still have some bone joint pain every now and then been on tamoxifen 1 year and 3 months but hey counting sherry thinking good thoughts for you glad you are home the best place to heal lezza 13 slightly old post but i am recently started tamoxifen because of some nausea w it i went to 10mg twice a day instead of 20mg once i am not sleeping very well but had not thought about the insomnia side effect i take a sleeping pill for years but even w that do not sleep more then about hours at most and then restless all night sure sounds familiar i am actually on a 2 week break from tamox my red splotches are on my face around my eyes and mouth and hands i call them lumpy exactly but they sure do itch and burn like mad as you say mine have diminished since pausing the tamoxifen but not entirely disappeared my current theory of many hah is that my skin is much drier because of the tamoxifen and therefore more susceptible to whatever this is contact derm allergy or my onc had me take zyrtec which did seem to relieve the itching and redness then stopped it the zyrtec and all was well for a few days then the red spots super flaky facial skin and itching roared back when i called the onc who suggested the two week tamoxifen break due to start back on tamox this tuesday good things about tamox too been on tamoxifen for over 4 years for prevention of invasive have lcis with very minimal ses i had to have a total hysterectomy a few years ago not by ovarian cysts and i still take tamox it actually has been used and studied for almost 30 years and is generally well tolerated by most with hot flashes being the most common se the incidence of the more serious ses endometrial ca or blood clots is reportedly very low less than 1 and tamox is actually good for your bones and heart i am a bit concerned about the dementia risk after the loss of the ovaries but 105 to 98 is not statistically significant so good news and i was so close to natural menopause 48 that doctors said it really impact me i do try to eat a more healthy diet excersize and take calcium with vit d twice a day but i have to say the immediate surgical menopause that goes along with oopherectomy is no fun at would much rather have gone thru a natural more gradual menopause if given the choice and while oopherectomy can certainly lessen the risks of bc due to the decrease in estrogen not the total elimination as it is still produced in the adrenals skin and fat it is not a valid substitute for chemo if that is what is recommended i have been taking arimidex for almost 7 years the ses that i notice are joint pain depression and just recently osteoporosis i am willing to deal with all ofl them in order to prevent a recurrence motrin and movement help the joint pain i take zoloft and abilify for the depression i took boniva for osteopenia for almost 7 years but now i have started on prolia you have to weigh the pros and cons and decide for yourself what is best for you xoxoxo lynn hi i will be having week 5 of taxol today i am two weeks behind on that because my liver enzymes were up for two weeks andi get it i am on week 8 of cisplatin i do get heartburn from the taxol pepcid ac works great i also get bouts of diarrhea i lost my hair on day 19 still have eyebrows and lashes i am the one who has a very itchy head with red spots my taste bubs are ok so far i have had some neuropathy in my finger tips i havehad several small nose bleeds also had some mouth sores but they are gone now i used magic mouthwash and nystatin swish and swallow these are both prescriptions and work awesome the worst side effect of all is extreme fatigue i hope this helps hugs to you and your mom marianne hey linda i am the queen of hip pain and radiation when my mets were found it was in the pelvis and hip area i had rads right away for the pain 15 blasts i felt much better with in 2 weeks i started walking without a limp then a few months later i had a lot of pain when i first put weight on my hip it hurt a lot i had to push for a mri turns out i had a fracture in my femoral head off to an orhtopedic surgeon here i am 3 months later anew hip so tmi for me the radiation was a breeze it took care of the pain and my walk i did get some diarrhea how do you spell that and some burning because good with the creamand it was in my yaya area i had 5 treatments of taxotere after that now i think that radiation may have added to the stress of the hip fracture maybe maybe not it could have anyhow on december 17th surgery biopsy my pelvis showed no evident signs of cancer so after you get your mri get an ortho surgeon involved just incase i am a huge proponent of radiation i think it killed my cancer and the chemo took out what was left janis i also had the fec then t treatment the fec was easier for me than the taxols but not everyone is the same for nausea prevention i took my puke pills starting the day before and four days after treatment i just want it to start at all drink lots of water and rest as often as you can with the fec have what they nickname the red devil the only thing that i noticed with this right away was to wear a minipad so your underwear get stained they also gave me a drip it was yellow and the nurse asked me to let her know if i started getting a stuffy nose or headache the first time i just ignored it because i just wanted to get the heck out of there but ended up with quite a headache so next time asked her to slow the drip for me no bad headache hard to believe but i have to go back and look at my old posts i forgot alot oh make sure you take stool softeners as the steroids really constipated me and it was awful watch your temperature one onc explained that the 4th to 7th day after treatment can be the worst for temp issues and if it hits 100 get in to the hospital i also ignored this advice and he explained one my very last treatment that this is the time that your body is working the hardest and infections can happen the easiest rockthebald has some great chemo tips she compiled look her name up and take a look at the thread great and they are going through chemo right now so get so much info and many chuckles there good luck karen i thought they just said not to drive while taking narcotic pain pills i did notice that it did tug at the drains a little hoping to get another one out this week i restarted my tamoxifen last week and have felt nauseated ever since and have been having depression and anxiety issues so this has been kind of tough i did not have the emotional issues when i had my mx and tram flap earlier this year i think dealing with this a second time in a short period has taken its toll i had considered myself a strong person maybe just not as tough as i thought and that has bugged me too 1marmalade regarding the creme my rad onc prescribed and i starting applying 3xday beginning on day one for the recipe for the saline solution i will have to try it caltex yes my feet hurt like crazy i was attributing the pain to3 months oftaxol but it seems to be getting worse even after chemo has stopped the pain seems to be worse right after i get up from either sleeping of sitting for a long period of time i am a very active person and the sore feet thing is starting to crimp my lifestyle so sorry to hear about september rad sisters who have to drive long distances for radiation i am extremely fortunate to have a universitycancer center that is less than 1 mile from work i scheduled most of my appointments around my lunch hour so i can take a leisurely walk to and from the center typically a coworker will join me for the walk and we will get frozen yogurt after wards since dec 2009 walked to the cancer probably 100 times it is so much a part of my daily routine but i cannot say i will miss it when it is gone today is 12 of 33 rads starting to feel a little burning and not a whole lot of fatigue i have an entryin thenike marathon walkingi time on oct 17 so i really hope the burning pain and fatigue does not get much worse macintx the way you fell sounds alot like how i felt no nausea just no appetite alot of the time i had to force myself to eat while i was going through the ac treatment with the taxol it has been alot better with my appetite i also remember feeling a funny feeling in my throat not really a sore throat but did not feel like it usually does glad to hear you are doing well ulawhen i received a neulasta shot after my first taxol infusion i did get alot of leg and joint discomfort but it did pass after a few days the chemo nurse told me that it was from the combination of the neulasta and my infusion of taxol this time my wbc was high so i did not have to get a neulasta shot so hoping no leg discomfort good morning ladies leanna a cabbage patch had to google it out as i have never heard the name of it lol though i know the dance thanks even if it was imaginary glad to hear you found a good place for nolan so that you can feel calm while on rads sorry to hear about your insurance in my country my treatment is fully covered though there might be problems if the treatment was a one and lucky to be in a clinic that is part of a medical faculty so basically doing the treatment because of teaching and research as for my nails i do wear nail polish i always have and stop during my tx a coat of hardener

and bitch to and know will understand big hugs to everyone and hope you all have a good restful weekend kathy so much to read about all of the arimidex experiences i also wonder about all of my s i know if they are related to this ai or not i started back in oct 08 so 7 months ago at first not too bad then by the time 3 months went by oh my bad bad joint pain leg cramps finger cramps hard to sleep but yet tired barely eating but yet feeling fat lol i wanted to go off of it and my oc said please give it 3 more months i have and the cramps and pain did get better i had to up my effexor xr though to help with the depression i also had a total hysterectomy in aug and the hot flashes i also have memory problems i remember sometimes the simple things i think too part of that is the damage chemo did to my brain the worst part for me is the slight weight gain but more than that the inability to lose i run power walk eat really healthy and nothing i feel like i need to give up all carbs cut out any sugars completely and only eat once a day to lose any weight all very fustrating i am er and pr positive how is the arimidex helping my chances of not having a reccurence if the odds are really low is all the other unknown damage that worth it somebody help me with this i go see my oc in a few weeks and i am wondering what i should say to her thanks for your help xoxolisa for skippy hi i am a qite a bit older than you i was diagnosed just before my 43rd birthday and am now 45 my children were both teenagers when i was diagnosed so i have the same issues there i have to say my heart out to you girls who are having to deal with this disease at such a young age and gives you so many other worries letrozole can only be used when post menopausal the chemo stopped my periods and as yet have never come back my onc said they are very unlikely to now and looking at my blood test results i am almost i think this is fairly common when women in their 40 s have chemo because we are nearer to our natural menopause sure my oncologist suggest i go onto letrozole after the 5 years of tamoxifen because the cancer was lobular it was suggested because i will be by then and recent studies have shown that it just might reduce the risk of recurrance further than the 5 years of tamoifen alone in some circumstances well at least how i understood it i hope this has helped a little talk to your oncologist about it let him know how important it is for you to be able to consider starting a family for what worth i think you did the right thing by deciding to take the nolvadex for the 5 years at the end of it and god willing you get a reccurance you will still be under 40 and i very much hope you get that baby you so want best wishes kimx feel better shorti my nails are a mess too from the taxotere black splotches red lines ridges and pain yuck i just hope they do not fall off one of them looks pretty iffy i am crossing my fingers in in the meantime i just got an envelope from motor vehicles my lic is due for renewal this summer aaarrrggghhh a picture of me in a scarf on my drivers lic for the next fouryears just when i thought i would be able to move past it i will have a reminder in my pocket at all times ah well hope you are all ahving a good day markat my taxotere is run for 1 hour now i am freaked out about the chest pain reaction i get that with my first however i had extreme bone pain with it i was at my ps office today to get filled and he was asking me about my treatments when i told him what all had happened to me he said that is not the typical side effects basically what happened to me was extreme bone pain that percocet even touch i ended up in the er due to the pain and extreme chills shaking they gave me delaudid and that finally worked for the pain after getting home from the er that is when the nausea and vomiting started i keep anything down at all i went in for a check up last thursday and i even walk into the office i had to have my husband get a wheel chair for me my oc is right in the same office as the infusion center so he sent me over for fluids once i got the fluids i felt so much better and was able to eat again and enjoy christmas the positive to all of this is we know for next time wednesday the 4th i got a nausea patch that lasts for 7 days that i will be putting on and ultram seemed to work for the bone pain lori plutz and ladyjane yes lortab is a prescription drug a pain med the med i was given after my bilateral mastectomy on the bottle it says 500ta taking it every six hours means sleeping a lot and feeling very drugged and high and happy but i have absolutely no pain from the neulasta it makes me want to cry with relief i just believe i lived with all that pain for four months yes i still get the neulasta with taxol to keep up the white blood cell count i begged my doc to not give me neulasta once i got on taxol but he said just as important during taxol as during ac to keep up that white cell count and yes when i started taxol i would get serious leg bone pain starting day 2 after taxol treatment unbearable pain what has been the worst for me on taxol is the neuropathy the horrible tingling and itching in my hands my doc give me anything for it but when i was just too much to live with i was given a prescription for atarax hydroxyzine by the doc on call so glad my doc was on vacation that took away the itching and tingling completely i was taking it every four hours for weeks at a time i still had numbness in my feet but that never bothered me too much since this last taxol 2 days ago i feel any neuropathy wondering if because of the lortab one thing that did help with the itching was to keep my hands under really hot running water but the atarax really was the answer you folks are so awesome i want to hug all of you really really tight a huggergaia morning no only on tamoxifen what is herceptin i was on metformin which is a diabetic drug that was believed to help tamoxifen but i lost to much weight so i stopped it so far stiffness in the knees are the biggest issue oh yeah and those lovely night sweats but i figure i would have had that anyway going into menopause one thing i am doing that may be somewhat controversial is marajauana oil i feel this is having a positive impact as well i know it is now available in the us three rice size drops a day it has helped with appetite and anxiety for obvious reasons and i have read that the canabanoids kill cancer cells i know kind of flakey but so there with trying everything thing also chaga tea or tinctures will help build white blood cell count hahaha i guess now officially one of the hippies love and hugs to all of you i was on anastrozole for almost 5 months and gained a lot of weight my oncologist said it puts you back in menopause and i gained my weight in menopause i could not lose the weight and now have had to go on blood pressure meds and blood sugar meds i had been taking thyroid for years but that was all i am in my 60 s and have stopped taking the medication for a month my doc would like me to try another cancer pill but i think i am off for good anyone else have this experience log in to post a reply in some cases it is good to suppress your disease volume with chemo then you can go on an once you have stabilized in my situation my onc tried me on tamoxifen when i was first diagnosed with stage 4 my disease rocketed so i went on a year of weekly taxol then had a year of faslodex with good results if your disease is accumulating rapidly you might want chemo initially as it works faster actually been on xeloda for 13 months now and am still stable no big side effects except for fatigue it really depends on how many mets in your liver and how your disease is progressing for example my onc went to chemo when my tms had gone from 800 to in 8 weeks he was very concerned about limiting progression quickly and chemo is great at that i have a question for you my special friends after this week i have really been questioning my chemo pretty determined to ask my onc at my next visit to just stop the chemo and go on to radiation even though i have mixed feelings about whether or not i have been able to do all i need to in order to rid my body of this cancer i love the computer symbols only time i ever cuss i really believe that the chemo will kill me long before the cancer will a recap of my chemo history a c x 4 every two weeks had 1 a c tx a week later had to go in two consecutive days for iv therapy then two days after that was in the hospital for 2 dayst c x 12 weekly first 4 tx was so sick and nauseated i wanted to die could not eat or drink for 3 or 4 days after each tx finally got a drug regimen that cut the nausea down by blood counts began to tank and onc said i would only have to do 9 tx of the 12 he would give me credit for my one a c tx that would equal 3 taxol txs fec x 3 every three weeks was supposed to start this regimen 2 weeks after my last taxol and ended up going 3 weeks longer than that because blood counts were not high enough finally had one tx 8 days ago and you all know what has already happened what do you guys think if i ask the onc to discontinue chemo will i just be digging an early grave thanks for the feed back i am on day 7 now no nausea meds anymore but man i am tired i sleep all night wake up hungry have a bite to eat then fall back asleep i want to walk 30 mins a day but cant seem to manage 3 weeks ago i was chasing my daughter on her bike for 5 miles now i can barely walk for 10 minutes does it get better or worse as my treatments keep coming i am only thinking about the first 4 treatments then i will think about the weekly taxol i try to really only think about one day at a time taking neupegen shots daily hope they work can i expect to get used to this tiredness does it get worse i am only 3 weeks out from my diagnosis and am still in shock over the news i moved quickly and think i may be emotionally exhausted as wellgeez this is the hardest thing i have ever done in my life thanks is advance for all advice and stories went to the new md today and it went very well i liked him a lot he said he would never leave me high and dry on the weekend he is changing my chemo to abraxane catherine i think that is what you are on he said since i am having so many side effects pain neuropathy of hands and feet voice hoarseness diarrhea and rash to name a few that it can be the detergent that taxol is mixed in that can cause the issues he said abraxane is not a first line drug for early breast cancer because it is newer and more expensive but when someone has all these se they change and try abraxane i start on the new drug on friday dose is same as taxol every two weeks with neulasta the day after he said i would come in to the office on saturday to get the neulasta since they continue to treat their patients on the weekend a remark meant for my last onc i hope the positive vibes continue i hate being the side effect queen karen 2 years ago i got np in both hands and feet after the 7th taxotere treatment it was particularly bad on the left numbess all the way to the knee and the right hand doctor put me on b complex vitamins plus an additional 1000 mg of vitamin b1 if i remember right since i also suffer from chronic pain from lymph node removal i have been on gabapentin and now lyrica since nov of 2010 the severety of the symptoms has lessend but i stil have np sorry to say on the bright side i also attend a support group and although a surprising number of ladies had neuropathy for most it either resolved completely or it got better it may take a year or more wish you well m when i was on chemo part of my regimen was cytoxan by mouth i have acid reflux and heartburn alot a year ago i went for a colonoscopy and endoscopy gastro dr said to take prescription zantac at night and it shoudl eventualy go away if i watch what i eat it is not bad they blame it all on the cytoxan cathi i was just about exactly where you are in the process a year ago as were the other women on this posting my chemo started last june 10 i did the 4ac 4 taxol every two weeks drink lots of water the day before of and after your ac treatments i sucked on ice throughout the infusion of the adriamycin which is supposed to help you keep from getting mouth sores not sure if it was using that or biotene toothpaste mouthwash but i never got any sores i did get sick of ice and water i really stomach either from about my 3rd ac on for months the chemo session itself was pretty unventful took a few hours so i took books we had videos we could watch took some light snacks also i found i got cold pretty easily so i took a sweater along hurt really are you getting a port i was glad i had mine except when they actually put the needle in sometimes i went out for lunch after feel tired probably and i always just felt a little off i never really felt nauseous throughout chemo the taxol was the harder for me as it caused quite a bit of bone pain a few days after for some women taxol taxotere are quite easy got a 7 and i think that he really aware given very at this age thank god anything that awful was happening to me well outside of the hair thing i was able to pretty much continue being regular old mom i did have sisters and my mom who flew in for most of my chemo sessions just to be here and support me and cook etc my advice take help when offered i remember a year ago wondering if i would ever have a normal life again you know where what you worry about are getting the kids to school what to pick up at the grocery store could you put off mopping one more day well this year i find myself having mostly normal days like that with a tinge of anxiety but busy thanking god my days are so boringly normal yours will be too sooner than you think about to go to my latest 3 month checkup take care i had ac x4 taxol x4 in 2005 for the new primary they found this april getting 12 weekly doses of taxol carboplatin halfway done and i can tell you from personal experience that the weekly side effects are much less than the variety i was very concerned about neuropathy but it has been much less on the weekly treatments my weekly treatments are three fridays in a row then i skip a week to get my blood counts back up repeat three times i need neulasta shots on the weekly regimen which is nice because i have the terrible bone pain i had during my 2005 chemo i think my bones were complaining about having to work overtime but now i do have to be careful not to eat raw produce because the germs that bother me usually now put my guts into overdrive yikes read that the weekly treatments are especially good for those of us who are triple negative yay i started with taxotere tch but had to change to abraxane after an allergic reaction to taxotere in the 2nd cycle abraxane is actually taxol attached to microalbumin or protein molecules instead of being dissolved in solution which is what caused the allergy because of the change in delivery system more taxol can actually be delivered per body weight i definitely experienced all of the taxol the neuropathy in both feet and in my fingertips is still here even though my last abraxane was april 2008 by the way i think that you have to fail taxol or taxotere before they will start abraxane because it is one of those really expensive meds as mary anne says i think it really did the trick for me also my 5 cm tumor was gone after only 2 tch cycles when i had a mastectomy done well i have been on tamoxifen for about 2 months and i definitely have noticed an increase in moodiness looking back at the past couple of months i think i had particular bad spells of depression hopelessness and crying prior to getting my period so probably hormone related but much worse than this last month things seem better i have also been on effexor 150mg for many years for anxiety and depression so sure it must be helping with i really had any hot flashes maybe just warm flushes if you continue to suffer with moodiness depression ask your doctor about getting an rx for effexor they prescribe it to help with hot flashes and it should help with your emotions as well i am not taking nausea meds with taxol i took 5 decadron steroid night before one hour before taxol i took 5 decadron 1 zyertec and 1 40mg of pepcid i only have to do this for the first 2 infusions for allergic reaction after 2 weeks i have to take the steroids any more i hate them they make me an emotional crazy mess i would rather be tired than crazy i had my first taxol on the 15th tired on friday icky feeling saturday and only mild tired and achy today beats the hell out of ac for sure two side effects from abraxane diarrhea and abdominal cramps for which i take lomotil but t3s are also prescribed bleeding caused by yeast infection due to low neutrophil counts my vagina swelled burned and i developed thrush nyastatin for the thrush and viaderm cream for my nether regions your gp sees more cancer patients than any mine is good for side effects cause our oncs live in ivory towers the onc had to reduce my abraxane i seem to tolerate any chemos but a lower dosage is working hugs and take care taxol number 9 was supposed to be today mo was going to switch it to low does taxotere because of my neuropathy and then said no no your neuropathy is to bad you need a to go to the operating room and have a break from chemo we want this to be permanent aaaaaaarrrrrrrggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i have an amazing bs that put me on her schedule for this thursday april 3 for my lumpectomy and i finish my last four doses of weekly taxotere now starting april 25 one week after i was supposed to be done with chemo so i will still start and finish radiation at the same time one good thing i had a looooong good cry about it but when i really think about it the right thing to do walking is really painful and i want to chance this being permanent when i think about what really upset about besides nasty chemo is the delay in getting my hair back and a little hair when our life is on the line even though i know that i think probably have a few more about this i hate chemo curious if they know taxol causes neuropathy and taxotere is less likely to and has the same benefits why do they use taxol at all adnerb i have had cytoxan before not taxotere it is drastic for me at this point in time with all the health issues i am facing now been losing about 2 pounds per week for the past 3 months and can barely even eat anything right now afraid my kidneys may fail they are barely functioning right now i believe this chemo will make all these problems and of course add new ones worse i of course do not want to lose my hair been there although it was quite awhile ago for me losing my hair was worse than losing my breast i did speak more with my onc today told him of my concerns which he totally agreed with the way he put it is that very sick right now he needs to use his ace taxotere cytoxan and not his jack gemzar navelbine etc this is it if i act on this right away and try the tax cyt then i had better startgetting my affairs in order of course not ready for that yet it just sure would be nice to be around positive pleasant people my kids ages 27 23 and 19 want to hear any of this and want to be involved not sure if this is their coping mechanism or they just plain care however they will care once its too late if i could tell you of all the stories of the constant stress they have put me through and its actually been more their spouses you believe it i have already told my 19 year old daughter who quit her final year of high school 2 months before she was to graduate this past june that she needs to work full time work part time and go to college or trade school or she can join the military my husband says he wants me to fight and for his own selfish reasons i say wtf after speaking with my dr today i believe that i will be starting my chemo before this week is over of course i am so not prepared for the further and more agressive fight that i know lies ahead at this stage of the game i really have no choices glad to hear from you blufin but i am sorry though that you are also going through this journey at such a young age i was officially diagnosed in 2014 even though i felt the lump in 2012 mine was cm grade 2 i had chemo after surgery radiation and tamoxifen i stop the tamoxifen after taking it for 4 months because of blur vision my vision is now ok after i stop but my onc want me to start again and i am considering it so where are you now in treatment wish you all the best hii too had taxotere as part of my chemotherapy and havenever regained a full head of hair i have a typical male pattern baldness pattern although i hadvery thick hair prior to my treatment only worked out from this discussion board that it is probably the taxotere i started on arimidex after my chemo and wondered whether that was the culprit my doctors were unable to give me an answer someone asked if anyone did anything besides a wig i gave up my wig after a while as i convinced myself it was growing back eventually i began looking around for alternatives and now have a hair integration system that works well for me i have enough hair to make this workable i am in the uk but will post the web address in case anyone wishes to learn more about the system hello my sisters first and foremost happy belated birthday cathy i have been pretty busy around the house also had one showing monday and suppose to have 2 yesterday but one cancelled 2 hours before hand no offers yet no dh went up to the trailer to open it up and do some work up there he said the grass looks like a hayfield and there are dandelions everywhere but no mice got into the trailer over the winter he said it is so peaceful and quite i could hear the birds in the background when he called me i think its time for another trim my hair is getting so unruly on the top and the curls are amazing everywhere i graduated from physio tonight finally since february 6 i have been going twice a week since my car accident in january it has become a royal pain especially since some of the showings interrupt my appts one

coming up soon graycie thank you for the birthday card i received it yesterday thanks for being so thoughtful my sisters were here when i got home from work as they took out the dogs while i was at work as we had a showing yesterday afternoon they saw the card and wanted to know who the rocktober sister was i have told them many times about our wonderful group and our trip in august but then my youngest sister said oh i remember now i think they try to put the fact that you have bc at the back of their minds they dont have to worry as much then victoria i loved your picture of the elephant cake it is so colourful thankyou we have so many perinnals here that i will miss when we sell it took years to get them where they are now full established menobabes that is a new term does that mean

weather has been much better yesterday and today it was 24c and tomorrow suppose to be 30c so no frost tonight i never like to hear or read about war anywhere i guess it is a way of life that you have unfortunately had to get use towe have no idea what it is like to live that way of life wondering when some bomb is going to go off somewhere seems so unfair having to expose school children to such a serious situationin a bomb shelter to write an exam so sobering stay safe my sister thanks for the information on posting birthday greetings didnt know that laura it was nice having monday off got the grass cut and all my planters organized and it was a beautiful day too renovations suck especially when things dont go as planned how could they not know they didnt have the same dye lot i would be foaming at the mouth that pink car is so small looks like a toy car i had a sleevless top on today and my sleeve as well its the first time i have worn the sleeve like that to work without hiding it

when do you get them having your membership paid for sounds amazing kelly you will have to post some pictures of the roller skating party sounds like you had fun too i guess you could look at it that

spotless is starting to wear on us its been 22 days since listing tracyseattle sounds like you enjoyed your vegas trip you must have been busy to visit 20 casinos we went to vegas for one night last april while visiting with our friends from az and i was still on my last month of chemo i was winded and had a hard time walking any distance so we only visited 2 casinos one of which was the hotel we stayed at i wouldnt rule out that other job things happen in our hr department all the time timing is off and things take longer than anticipated have you made a followup call just to enquire whether or not the position has been filled maryanne glad to hear that life is busy for you and you seem to be establishing your new normal like a lot of us are trying to do the cottage must be realizing for you on the weekends after such a busy week i cant wait to go up to our trailer next weekend tracyny forgot to mention that i love your new curtains in your bedroom or did i already tell you that omg my brain feels like it needs to be retuned somedays debbie 444 yap if i get down on the floor i usually have someone help me up as i feel like my joints freeze up and after sitting for awhile i hobble when i get up i do feel that the armidex has aged my body tremendously have been on it a year now i have greatful though that i have the option of hormonal treatments brenda angus is cute our scooby would have eaten that plastic bib before the picture got taken lol cathy glad to hear that you celebrated and enjoyed your day hello to all to get ready for bed tired tonight again love you all cant wait until august to meet you michele ryjeum i also experienced the dried blood and runny stuffed bloody nose and terrible sinus pressure at times i could not tell what was causing the symptoms prior to unblinding but did try over the counter meds and prescribed allergy meds but nothing worked so i stopped taking it all i was thinking it was the avastin but it turned out to be the taxol causing the problem lack of sleeping well you are talking to the right group of women lack of sleepappears to be one of the most common and the one that cannot be resolved most woman are on sleeping aids due to from chemo drugs anxiety and just dealing with the cancer and all that it brings so far these are the results of the unblinding i received the placebo arm a and did not continue teresa and carolyn are in arm c and both moved on for 10 more avastin treatments desi received arm b with avastin and does not continue only arm c is offered to move on with 10 more this helps i have a script for celexa citalopram which i believe is in the same family as effexor guess i better start taking that again and will try taking the aromosin in the morning as i had been taking it at bedtime thanks everyone for your suggestions by the way when first diagnosed 9 years ago i was on tamoxifen then switched to femara the hot flashes were constant for 5 years and the joint pain was horrific but never had night sweats like these better go mop up the bedroom now i gained 30 during chemo the most during taxol as i had major swelling from water weight that takes some time to go down lost all the chemo weight now working on the extra weight i had before dx lol take care bugs hello all when i was diagnosed i was already undergoing what my opthamologist believed was vision changes enter the lovely breast cancer diagnosis right after surgery i was so concerned my onc sent me for a ct without contrast all normal opthamologist confirmed i started ac vision still crappy but other fish to fry stated taxol vision gets worse blurry really dry eyes and more floaters which i had before told onc several times and she said it could be the chemo that many have similar complaints my question to you all is has anyone else noticed the same i was hoping it would improve after chemo but still crappy 6 weeks pfc do i need to give it more time i am hoping to avoid yet another doctor appointment but thinking it is inevitable they will send me back to opthamologist for what worth my eyes are still tearing all the time thanks taxol and yet dry i trust you ladies more than anything looking forward to what you think trying really hard not to feed the fears but given that i have never had scans i am paranoid sandra hi everyone my computer was down for several days so been trying to catch up looks like a lot has happened sorry everyone has the blues right now it will be so much easier when spring gets here gloomy days just help much do they i have my first ac treatment this week feeling a little nervous about it the taxotere was rough enough and waiting to see what this brings the doctor prescribed emend for nausea with the ac has anyone taken this a 3 pill pack that i start the day of treatment guessing the nausea must be more profound than with the taxotere carolyne glad your second taxol treatment went better for you hope the new med helps too texas karen great to learn about the mag and vit b info i had quite a bit of trouble with neuropathy in fingers and feet with the taxotere no one mentioned that before in my onc office would have loved to try it earlier interesting that several of you are having 12 treatments of taxotere i had 4 every 3 weeks then the ac thanks too for the book info i ordered it today karyll hope you are adjusting to being home i worked for about 7 weeks it was strange at first but then i found i had energy to do the things i wanted to i realize how tired i was after work until i working i was definitely more interactive with my family and friends i am going back to work feb 1st and kinda wish i was staying home longer i need to make my std last since i still have surgery and radiation to finish enjoy the time do what you like to do pamper yourself for those growing hair you go girls i wait until mine starts to come back i always had very fine hair straight as an arrow i always complained that i do a darn thing with it but oh how i miss that hair now i cry too often about this journey but i do get tearful at times in the shower when i need to reach for the shampoo just not right not natural sometimes there much to make me feel very feminine excited for you all well i know i addressed all the posting but i have a appointment and am still in my pjs hope the day brings at least one good thing for each of you and those you love peace and all that good stuff ladies theresa on day 4 post 1st taxol following ac it is totally different feeling ac made me beyond exhausted and i usually had a headache migraine i was also constipated i really never felt any side effect from the nuelasta one time i had minor bone pain that subsided with ibuprofen so far i feel none of the ac exhaustion or headache had hot flashes shortness of breath tingling in my fingers and mouth and the big d the worst is that i have horrible bone pain confused if this is from the nuelasta or the taxol ibuprofen 600mgs every 4 hours touching it i just took a claritin and will continue it but that might take a couple days for relief any advice thanks dbab debbie my onco prescribed ativan to counteract the insomnia caused by the dexamethasone decadron and to provide some relief but also to reduce anxiety who me anxious why for sake my onco looked at my dh and said the ativan would help with irritability which the decadron can cause why would she look at him when saying that robink two things watch out for constipation and watch out for indigestion those can dominate your life during the first week after a tc treatment if you get on top of them right away i think nausea is such a big problem with tc like it is with ac adriamycin cytoxan and some of the other regimens the meds are notorious for causing constipation i would like to report that i am doing well today day 9 of round 2 that would be true if it were not for one nagging little problem that has appeared on the top of my head i have a rash all over my scalp red itchy bumps but only where my hair was is this is despite a conscientious program of scalp hygiene that has not changed since chemo began i e no new chemicals or conditions except the chemo most of the bumps are just scabs or anything a very tiny fraction of them have small pustules like folliculitis might have i have never worn a wig and i only wore a soft cotton cap about 5 hours ok after a few literature google searches taxotere is among the chemo drugs that can cause folliculitis and or pustulopapular papulopustular dermatosis not usually bacterial the pustules are sterile but the bumps can become infected if scratched or kept under cover so tomorrow i need to call the office again i guess tell me again what know about scalp rashes please otter scritch scritch scritch going to jump onto this thread i may very well be facing pmps dx going back to md anderson sept 12 to see a new ps hopefully get referred to a real pain management doctor if necessary had a lot of crazy stuff happen in the 2 years since i was diagnosed 20 wks pregnant at dx lumpectomy biopsy done w o anesthesia fac x4 while pregnant normal delivery taxol x2 taxotere x1 neuropathy w taxol then allergic rx to taxotere bm w expander recon pbso with over 2 units blood necessary since i almost bled to death emergency hyst from abscess that formed after pbso one month later and exchange surgery i have 800cc implants to replace my dd ddd natural breasts oh all this was before my 30th birthday ihave 2 year old daughter my chemo baby a 4 year old son a husband of 5 years a job the only our family can live on and commute 70 miles a day 5 days a week its been 6 months since my exchange surgery by the end of the day i can hardly stand the pain in my chest neck arms sometimes its sharp stabbing but othertimes its achy and tight its almost always ie my whole chest hurts not just one spot i feel like i hit my only it extends up to my shoulder neck as well as into my hands sometimes allergic to lyrica neurontin i tried it for the narcotics just seem to be doing anything the best relief i get is from a muscle relaxer and or the voltaren gel that i just recently started using tried some theraputic massage i was so sore i could hardly move for a couple days afterwards in the midst of chiropractic care to help my spine cope with compensating for my painful front in the midst of pain management that started with a referral for trigger point injections that work has developed into a narcotics prescription the ps that did my exchange has basically washed her hands of me b c never seen any one have issues like this the same for a better class ps more experience w reconstruction than my local ps but still louisville ky the option these 2 pss have given me are 1 live with it 2 operate put in smaller implants might or might not work they predict 3 operate not put implants in at all might or might not work they predict i chose option 4 go somewhere where they do reconstructions on a daily basis i have to say that at this point i have a whole lot of hope which completely depresses me i was on a couple different to deal w my mondo hello surgical menopause but they seem to help me at all i was on each of them for well over the minimum time required to notice a difference i ate a breakfast sandwich on the way usually and then i also took snacks with me heck i pretty much pigged out during my treatments maybe the steroids caused me to be hungry although not sure as i love to eat all of the sudden and i have managed to drop almost thirty pounds not that i wanted or needed to i would definitely take very cold water and drink continuously as i have been fortunate enough not to have mouth sores i have 9 more taxol to go and ever been nauseous during treatment of the a c or now the taxol however a c made me a little nauseous after treatment but they give meds for that good luck loriekg i have also heard you can sometimes get tear ducts to clear up with gentle massage it would be great if something less invasive is the solution i guess my twitchy eyes can be related to fatigued as well not the best sleeper never have been mommacat 4 for me it really just feels like little struggles they keep changing around the one with the port issue but with only 1 to go not going to worry about it now at least it a blood clot brandi having one of those up days too 100 sure it is the steroids from this last chemo for me i expect it to wear off late tonight or early tomorrow hope your awesome continues thanks for the heads up on the feet too they have been pretty good and i would say most of the damage on mine seems to be on the heels i am going to keep rubbing that dry skin off lol re getting kicked out of a pedicure i think that is fantastic you are happy with the plastic surgeon you found and it will be done for free right now i bet the most uplifting thing is to be told how good you are doing way to go beachbum i have never had neulasta but the pain i got from my previous taxotere treatment was unbelievable they gave me a script for codeine too hope i have to use them but glad to hear you had some success with them while on chemo lch 033 i hope you get good advice from your surgeon and mo i will obviously always be a concern when lymph nodes are taken but there has to be a way not to worry about it constantly i really want to work at letting stress go jlstacey good luck on our taxol chemo today hope it went uneventfully u4iachic only getting the taxotere portion now but i believe the pain i experienced last cycle it came on fast furious and relentlessly for 3 to 4 days it continued longer than that but the extra strength tylenol i was trying to take eventually helped nothing relieved that initial pain this time i am hoping i experience it at all by taking the codeine pills i now have one other thing i wanted to mention to you is that right after my surgery but before chemo i was experiencing all these crazy aches pains all over my body i worried all day long but mostly at night about the cancer continuing to move throughout my body i did have follow up bone and ct scans done that find anything my dx is slightly different then you with a higher grade so maybe why the scans were done for me not sure even though the tests were done i initially convinced about them anyway i realize everyone is different but i got to a point where i said you are driving yourself crazy with worry and besides what am i going to do about it anyway it took me a while to let that feeling go but once i did those pains miraculously disappeared at the same time of course not pain free or completely worry free all the time but life i think hope this helps a little bit along with the good information both beachbum and cubbieblue gave kristin i am in awe too of your nail icing too hope you neutrophils kick in hard so you remain under house arrest too much longer although hopefully you are able to relieve some of the fatigue you are feeling no nausea awesome continue success for recovery from taxol 1 pmr 53 my gi system is totally messed up as well in my case i have so much of a hard time eating but it never feels right and i know only eating what i can tolerate taste wise i just hope it is the one thing that clears up very quickly once chemo is done not sure i will ever feel the same as i did before all this started going on but hopefully i can work towards some kind of normal later take it easy on yourself as you have still got a ways to go wishing everyone a gentle relaxing day wendy bone pain i was on tamoxifen and the pain was so tremendous that i would hug my son and just cry i did take the meds morphine small amount twice a day gabapentin and tramadol somtimes i was a little spaced out but it was so much better than the terrible bone pain i just have never felt anything like that pain no even childbirth been on tamoxifen 4 months top 3 se for me are skin changes constipation bloating fatigue i did have trouble sleeping at first but take melatonin every night it helps it help at first but i kept taking it noticed after a week or so i was sleeping much better i feel like gained a tremendous amount of weight but i think really the bloating and constipation making me feel this way gotta get that under control somehow the skin changes are awful on minocycline for these acne things that developed under my chin jawline ears they are better but scared to death to finish the minocycline the fatigue is by far the worse side effect for me working full time and probably putting in too many hours but not anything i done before now it seems like i can barely put one foot in front of the other i also cry at the drop of a hat oops i guess that makes 4 i hope it gets better ladies this is tough hi there at the present the role of evista in breast cancer is still not fully defined it has been shown to lower the incidence of invasive breast cancer among those who are at high risk but for someone who is already diagnosed with breast cancer the role of evista is still not clearly defined tamoxifen can increase the risk of developing a uterine malignancy and i believe it is the right decision to have the uterus removed the ovaries are also likely to lose function in the next few months or years brought about by natural menopause so i understand why there is a hesitance to remove this however removing the ovaries can make you eligible to receive aromatase inhibitors like arimidex or femara which carries a more favorable side effect profile compared to tamoxifen has anyone had any experience of good results from using coq 10 i have read recently that it is supposed to help with energy levels and may also reduce the dreaded hot sweats nightmare at the mo in particular i was 100 er and pr positive and am worried about anything that may encourage the hormones again i had chemo mx and anc then rads and am currently on arimidex with zoladex for the hormone side of things and monthly zometa iv for bone secondaries and chemo induced osteoporosis i have what seems like all the common side effects from the original treatment and the current drugs tried evening primrose omega 3 and the magnet in the knickers but no joy my onc wants me to stay on the current regime in spite of the really hormonal side effects as i have a 98 chance of recurrence within 5 yrs only statistics i know and i would rather do that anyway thanks liz hi everyone finished 3 rounds of fec and then 3 rounds of taxotere on january man oh man i am glad that is done tattooed and started rads on tues mar in it for the long haul as scheduled to get 30 treatments using 100 pure aloe gel also startedtamoxifenon feb and am getting some dandy hot flashes started swimming on feb and am trying to build up my strength and lose some weight scale is reading the same number as the past month but jeans and other clothes are getting real tight will be seeing a le therapist soon as my passion is driving my motorcycle and i want to do everything to be able to continue doing so been able to get much sleep over the past months and am very annoyed by it so seeing another therapist to learn relaxation techniques so that maybe get at least straight hours of sleep every now and then so as of today mar i am 3 down and 27 to go nicky i just started aromasin hoping that i have less than i did with tamoxifen after months i could not handle it any more keeping my fingers crossed that i have less issues with aromasin by the way my hair really thinned out on tamoxifen now wearing a wig at work and i have started taking biotin day 5 after first taxotere infusion and i feel like i have been hit by a truck the first two days were really good not as tired and foggy as with fec in the first week but my body aches so much maybe from the neupogen that i am taking every day for seven days woke up with a low grade fever and have had a sore throat since yesterday stayed home from work today and will contact chemo center to see if i should be worried about the fever and throat fever is down now i see that a sore throat and mouth can be a se of taxotere i have any pain killers from my doctor and am not sure about taking tylenol because it might mask a fever will try to get a massage today to see if that helps been wondering about taking a break from tamoxifen been on it for over a year after 6 months on femara i switched because of the severe joint pain also on lupron injections very 3 months to put keep me in menopause my side effects are hot flashes sleep troubles which i have been tolerating leg cramps come go but now i am starting with the joint muscle pain again also the weight gain is terrible i have changed my eating habbits exercise since being diagnosed nothing is working anyway i was thinking about stopped for a month or so my son is getting married in about 4 weeks thought that maybe i could loose a few pounds diminish the joint pain has anyone taken a tamoxifen break log in to post a reply hi darlene i debated a long time 4 months about going on an ai no way would i do tamoxifen i was 63 at diagnosis spring 07 and the stroke risk is just too high for me in the end i decided to try femara which is the ai my onc favors have done any of the ais and if the side effects were too much go off he thought that was fine so far nothing but hot flashes and about 2 ibuprofen week level of of achiness the side effect watching for is bone thinning i like the risks of the bisphosphonates so if when i get to ostepenia i drop femara so far still ok i think you need to work out what worries you more e g bc or the various side effects especially the sudden things like stroke you can quit if joint pain is too bad strokes go away and why and what you are comfortable with and do it listen to us all sure but do it your way because your bones and joints and hot flashes and in the end your risk my diagnosis was idc 1cm no node involvement but very widespread adh no one ever suggested chemo so a bit different risk benefit calculation from yours still i figure i could be around for another 30 yrs and the cumulative risk of recurrence gets up there about 30 by 30 yrs for me femara cuts that by 40 so that would be down to about 18 worth it to me i think but i really really debated it for months hi murphy i have to agree most people have no idea do they i was telling my manager about my back pain the other day and she was exactly the same as your colleague i have a condition that would probably have deteriorated when i got to menopause but after a year of zoladex now osteopenic and the deterioration has kicked in years before it would have done very dispiriting to think that the daily pain i have now is probably only going to get worse though i am still grateful that these treatments exist and are available to me i actually envy people who have no idea been lucky not to have been touched by cancer i certainly wish none of us had been by the way have you looked at exemestane in your ai research my onc has said like me to move onto it at some point from tamoxifen it seems to have a different mechanism of action from anastrozole and letrozole so perhaps side effect profile would be different lymphoedema ladies i know what to say other than to send hugs xx lainieg i like the sound of nestling in a cosy bedroom especially at this time of year i imagine david is waiting on you hand and foot fingers crossed that the dizziness passes soon take care xxx welcome beacon tink is right we tend to have some fun here to break up the stress and feel good about ourselves i help you with the hair issues i know if mine is thin because of age or the tamoxifen but i have my cut so it looks thick for the nails i had strong nails before but now they are much softer i have been using knox gelatin i love so i mix it in with it and have seen some improvement tink how are you doing today sweetie i have been taking anastrozole for six months for the first five months i experience any particular problems last month my pharmacy said that the anastrozole in my new refill was from a different manufacturer that what i had been taking before i now have noticed increased knee and hip pain and much worse hot flashes than i had before moreover my hair has started to fall out again this had not been a problem for a few years i will mention this to my mo when i see him in two weeks but i have no idea which anastrazole i was taking before i am stage iv with liver mets and am currently ned since may adriamycin cytoxin shrunk my liver tumor from 16 mm to 6 mm taxol herceptin blewit out of the water i know you take herceptin but chemo is doable looking back it seems a lifetime ago and that there were no side effects of course i did but in hind sight it too bad with ac food tasted horrible i was jacked up on steroids xanax counteracted that i lost my hair and just felt icky i had treatment on tuesday and the se hit on thursday by saturday i was feeling better i never got sickfrom the treatment compazine and zofran counteracted nausea i am editing this because i forgot to mention the neulasta shot a shot after each ac treatment to pump up your wbc this shot made me hurt and ache because it forces the bone to create more marrow where wbc are created but the pain subsided by the next day for me this was the worst part with taxol i had neuropathy i was actually pulled off after my treatment and sent for surgery that was in april after sugery scans and poking and prodding i was declared ned as soon as treatment ended feeling came back in my hands and feet the most important thing that i can tell you is that if you do have a negative side effect tell your doctor there are so many wonderful meds to counteract the steroids i will say that i maintained a full time job through chemo and miss any work i wish you luck and let me know if i can do anything for you other than to send hugs no i sick with taxotere at all either but i still got depression just remember if you are in the middle of chemo that it will pass i know how consuming it is when you are in the middle of it you feel like you have been going forever and your whole life is chemo and cancer i am about 6 months out and it is now a very distant memory i struggle to remember how i felt etc so just hang in there get it done feeling good will return started to use progesterone per dr instructions and feel really good about this choice ever notice how no one who is er pr is offered a progesterone blocker just estrogen blockers convinced natural progesterone is a protective and is needed to balance our estrogen with breast cancer caused by estrogen dominance there are 2 ways to achieve is to reduce estrogen this is what we are usually offered by our ocs and deal with all the things that happen when we are deprived of estrogen the other is to increase progesterone going for the later been reading on here for a while and hope i get blasted for this choice time and time read of how women take tamox and or aromatose inhibitors and their bc still comes back they offer no guarantees yet women who choose not to take these substances are made to feel that if our bc comes back it is our fault at 51 understand i have a lot of years ahead of me hopefully in which i could have a reoccurance but that also means i could have a lot of years ahead of me to have to deal with health problems caused by tamox and or aromatose like heart disease also deadly blood clots and stroke deadly osteoporosis if not deadly close sexual dysfunction not ready to give it up going for the do no harm things natural progesterone more exercise optimizing vitamin d using dim when my rads are done continuing to eat a clean sugar and processed food free diet eliminating xenoestrogens and toxic chemicals from my environment as best i can and mostly moving on from what i can tell once you are on tamoxifen or aromatose therapy you need to be closely monitored for side effects my mother who died 4 years after being diagnosed w bc never stopped being a bc patient chemo surgery rads hormones different hormones more chemo and even though she was well for about 2 of those years no cancer only dealing w side effects of her treatment she was never able to move past this diagnosis and enjoy what was left of her life because not only were the side effects she experienced unpleasant but there was always looming in the future yet another or test just going to do it differently nj i lost 60 pounds prior to dx chemo put 22 of those pounds back on been a long road but i have managed to lose 17 of those 22 pounds while on femara the aches and pains gone but they are better and my arm and truncal lymphedema is much more controlled now as well no magic bullet just diet and exercise can you manage 30 minutes of exercise a day it have to be all aerobic it might be a pilates or yoga class or dvd it might be a brisk walk it might be weight training start small and light since i see you have nodes removed and are a risk for lymphedema if you manage 30 minutes start with 5 or 10 or 15 minutes whatever you can manage now is better than nothing one suggestion come on over and join us on the post our daily exercise thread we have women at all stages of treatment and women of all weights and shapes the idea of the thread is simple we post whatever exercise done that day whether a aerobic dvd a session with a wii fit taking the dog for a walk or just doing a few stretches we post it something about that accountability keeps you going a wonderful supportive group and we all encourage each other good luck you can do it starting today get out there and do something for those 5 10 or 30 minutes i understand your dread of chemo i dislike the stuff myself its your best chance to wipe out the cancer however taxol is one many people start with my doctor started me with xeloda felt it was the easiest one to start on you get to keep your hair on xeloda too on abraxane now side effects are supposed to be mild but i am fatigued quite a bit been reading another post and some docs do prescribe medicine for fatigue i bet your doctor could if you need to keep working having to take care of your job and your husband must be taking alot of will power and strength those qualities will help you get through the chemo many women on this site work while on chemo time limit is a good idea i have a 3 month time right now its easier when i think of the three months like i made it through 2 weeks i can do another 2 good luck to you glad you have such great doctors talking to you and helping you make good decisions try not to be too worried it will be allright hi harley im a newcomer i was diagnosed on masectomy on i finished chemo on ac t now im gettin herceptin hormone therapy ive been usingnioxinsincemy hair fell out i think it works now its a dark peach fuzz i refused to wear a wig because it was not me my hair is growing everyday i have to shave my legs again lol we are all sluggos lol my kids rub my head too they are my greatest works of art i will pray for your surgery on the 7th god bless been on tamoxifen for about a year now after 1 year on arimidex i switched to tamoxifen due to lower extremity pain andnot being able to afford arimidex i battlednausea and vomiting really bad during chemo even with all the meds to combat it at one point i was dehydrated and had to be given iv fluids at my oncologist office then since ending chemo 21 months ago suffered with nausea and vomiting on and off it started well over a year ago so my doctor sent me to a surgeon thinking i had diverticulitis i have a history of diverticulosis after the surgeon did ct scans of abdomen and ultrasound they determined i had a gall bladder so i had it laparoscopically removed for a little while the nausea went away but came back for several months i suffered with nausea vomiting diarrhea lower abdominal discomfort and fever it took 2 hospital stays and manyemergency room visits for the doctors to determine i hadc diff which is a bacteria that slowly destroys the gi tract i fired my gi doc and got another one who has helped me alot aftertests provedthe c diff was killed i still was sick with nausea vomiting sothe new doc suspected the c diff haddestroyed the cells that break down lactose hence now lactose intolerant been offlactose completely andwasdoing much better but still got queezy alotin the morning and after lunch time it progressively got worse to where i work full time because throw up my boss would make me go home until i got a that i was ok to come back they are afraid the cdiff might return because it can be contagious and we do surgeries on patients in the office anyways so this last time its been so bad the doc thought i had diverticulitis but i had no diarrhea i was offwork again for over a week while testing results came back it turned out i have any active infection through all this a couple of times toall my doctors gi internal med if it could be tamoxifen or any of the other meds i am on i was told not likely but the more i thought about it the more i started to suspect that it was the tamoxifen i take mypill first thing everymorning after discussing this with my mom she suggested i try taking it at bedtime and see what happens so today for the first time i did not takemy tamox and i feel wonderful nonausea whatsover no body aches fatigue ihave been unable to sit on the floor difficulty climbing stairs walking with slight limp etc today i had none of that i sat down cross legged on the floor with my coworkers today and we all cried tears of joy i believe it i really realize how bad been feeling until today going totake my pill at bedtime and hope for the best over the weekend if my symptoms return going to call my office on monday scheduled for a scope down the throat on 10 but if proven it is the tamoxifen call my gi doc to cancell the procedure i guess i want to knowif anyone else has had this problem and what the solution was has anyone else taken tamoxifen at night instead of the am and has it worked to lessen the side affects worried about not being able to continue if this time switch work the side affects were getting so bad it is interfering with my life work finances mind etc sorry this is so long but been through the ringer with this and get frustrated that taken this long to come to this conclusion with none of my doctors being able to properly diagnose you deb hi dear friends great to hear from mel and tinkc congratulations with getting on with life so happy the baby is doing great i am still plowing through fac and whining alot i seem to bounce back as fast after 3 and am dreading 4 i am losing several fingernails and my fingers are really sore no twitching so far it has surprised me how long the side effects of taxol hang around i finished taxol in may and just now am losing fingernails and toenails no sign of hair either i am sure because i am finishing up with fac that delays hair growth a friend that finished taxol in feb recently lost her eyebrows and eyelashes again the doc at md anderson seem to have an answer for her she is on tamoxifen the onc did tell her that she could expect it to take a year after the completion of all chemo and treatment to feel level of health patience patience i am short on that marsha a reunion next feb would be great i am in hope carynn and catherine are staying cool i will be so glad to feel like working out it is too hot here to walk my white counts are low so not going to gym patience again i am sure all that will come about in time you are all on my mind love and hugs to all sammie kay renate i was on femara for just under 2 yrs seem to get any side effects except low libido i thought it was ok then i realized i felt mentally fuzzy all the time i also got some nasty joint pains at 18 months have put up with those but the mental fuzz wasnot acceptable my brain is my most valuable asset so i quit with my blessing incidentally my point try an ai if it messes up your quality of life quit at your age you might want to avoid tamoxifen because of the risk of stroke unlike joint pains libido and mental fuzz catastrophic irreversible and not worth the reduced bc risk i was 63 when i made that decision too high even then and chemo yeah that invriably side effects on the whole system but the ais are very variable in the side effects and easily quittable my aunt had bc at 70 a recurrence single spinal met at 88 just turned 96 people are living longer yourself by reflex on the other hand i really do agree with you about quaity of life cheers mouser i just finished my 6th tx of taxotere carboplatin and herceptin you can get neuropathy with taxotere but usually not as bad you onc should watch you closely if it is bad they will reduce your dose or discontinue not all neurpathy is permanent i have some numbness in my left heed but pretty sure that will go away neuropathy can be painful i know i would rather have my mobility and no pain neuropathy issues than hair and i had beautiful hair now a wait and see if it comes back if it getting a nicer wig and some more cool scarves hi your symptoms sound like mine i had two bad weeks of nausea when i started in february and then i had no symptoms at all until a couple of weeks ago when i quit taking lexapro since i learned on this site that it counteracted the tamoxifen since then i had hot flashes for a week and now i have any except i just missed my period 50 so i would really like that to stop anyway my oncologist told me that most women have no with tamoxifen he said the small percentage that have bad are just very vocal and talk about it a lot i just keep riding the bc rollercoaster and hoping for the best good luck to all of you nancy actually not tmi pencil thin stools lend toward diverticulosis the blood streaking is also characteristic because hard stool is trying pass through a space that has narrowed over time trying to deal with the consistent hard stool and pouches that have a change in the mucosal lining b c of the pouch formation like a weaking in the old tube tires pretty sure i described that in page one i found a webmd article and slide show that put at the bottom lay off the chia seeds for now there is no accepted evidence that seeds and nuts are a problem but you are in a more acute situation kj sweetie i am going to be dead honest with you and your not going to like it also others my read this and say think it out of bounds i thought you wrote to me with the original problem awhile ago but paged back two pages and see a post found it remembered it was on the rectal issues thread going to copy and paste that post after this b c it will show a better hx of present problem which ultimately will help someone else having to revise response b c i thought i read you were having a ct this week then missed it on a second read totally changes the response so bear with me if you are already reading because you are having the ct friday i took out all the dramatic worst case scenario info please consider though you are a high risk plan below if a ct is ordered for friday pcp or mo had to order it the order should be ct of the abd and pelvis with and without contrast depending on the ct report it will indicate how fast you get a gi appointment at this time a colonoscopy would not be done for the following reason history of pain blood in stools pencil thin stools definitive imaging of the abd pelvis is indicated before a scope is introduced my recommended plan 1 if you develop fever even without abdominal pain go directly to the emergency department you are a high risk patient for abdominal diverticular rupture or leak until proven otherwise fever could be in response to early peritonitis peritonitis is associated with pain but may not present with pain in the early phase of a leak versus a rupture ruptures definitely get your attention and are associated with intense pain at time of rupture 2 follow up asap with whomever made the ct appointment there is a list of questions on the pervious page that i wrote for minus two the questions apply to you too try and copy the questions and write the answers prior to doc visit it will help you cover all bases and post from rectal issues thread placed here to give a complete picture of abdominal problemfeb 12 2014 pm kjones 13 wrote i appreciate this topic thanks for bumping it i have had two rounds of cdiff so i am freaked out of a reoccurrence always i think i was more sick with cdiff then with 18 weeks of taxol anywho ever since i got my bc diagnosis my colon has not been the same with all the different meds like a circus with my bowels most recently i have had rectal bleeding for 3 months but then i just decided to take colace everyday and now there is no blood i just really want to add another specialist into the mix with the taxol and perjeta causing the big d i was taking lomotil like crazy then taxol stopped got a little better but then started taking oxy for back pain then got cdiff 2x s taken lomotil in 7 months not going to let anything get backed up and have a chane to breed bad bacteria besides the bleeding i had i also have pain in my butt it hurts to sit down and kind of feels numb deep down in my saddle area maybe differed pain from l5 met web md teaching article webmd slide show good luck with infusion number 2 sweethope hope it goes well xi had taxol round three 3 today must admit that i have found the last week very tough still struggling with diarrhea my mo has prescribed imodium but it really helped very much lost another kilo in the past week and i am sure it is because everything i eat just goes straight through me wondering whether this is linked to the taxol or to the perjeta which i have once every three weeks any ideas my mo was also a little concerned that i am already feeling some numbness in my hands and feet both my big toes have gone numb and my hands tingle from she feels that this se has started early than usual and says i must be super sensitive to the chemo she has prescribed to neurobian to help so fingers crossed that it works i managed to work three full days this week went okay but must admit that i was absolutely shattered at the end of every day not even really capable of coherent conversation feel like i am turning into a recluse not going anywhere or doing anything just have the energy been invited to a farewell party in friday night so will try and go for a few hours and see how i cope might also try and meet a girlfriend for breakfast on saturday seei started losing my hair yesterday noticed a bit more hair fall than usual when i washed it yesterday and then this morning in the shower it was falling out by the handful decided yet whether to just let nature take course or whether to shave it my husband thinks it great fun to pull it out men brandi sweethope i am also stunned at the cost of these treatments and am so grateful that i have such a good private health insurance my taxol treatments cost around us a session and around us when they add herceptin and perjeta to the cocktail not sure how that compares to the u s on that note goin to sign off and head to bed here in dubai wishing you all a wonderful daydi xxx jo i do not have dry eyes or floaters as someone else surmised my vision is blurry due to the retinas being damaged permanently nothing to be done about that just protection from the sun i do have the freckle mole that will be checked every 6 months as new i posted on the arimidex thread that after 4 years of menopause and no period since being switched from tamoxifen to aromasin in sept 2010 after 3 years of tamoxifen my period started xmas day heavy for 2 days onco said to stop the aromasin and see a gyn specialist jan 12th so the gift that keeps giving is continuing oh joy sorry not my usual chipper self juli warrior 70 my tissues expanders had to come out because i was still producing fluid after 4 months and i believe my body was rejecting them my breasts were always red and swollen bordering on infection nemanchec me too i feel like i am doing reverse weight watchers every time they weigh me before taxol i am up another pound i think it is the decadron that is doing it i just finished that nasty taxotere every treatment was worse i did 6 cycles i thought i was going to die with each one i had a ton of bone pain i was 1 week on three weeks off i feel for you but let me teell you it kicked my cancers butt i am in remission and on xeloda now which is a piece of cake brenda mmmm cream of wheat i have and love it but forgot about it and the melons they are good day 6 since 1st taxol i am plain tired not much joking on infusion day i think my mo was surprised and not much chatting i sleep the first 2 nights but i finally caught up on it this weekend i think i slept 13 hours straight sat i am grateful i can drink fluids ok again but muscle and bone aches i swear already forgotten what the ac ses felt like and now taxol feels just wow i feel like i can do more than i did on ac like housekeeping on taxol just the tin man needing a little oil on ac my body broke down if i did too much too much is all relative i am a little worried about the neuropathy my feet did feel slightly tingly so i do believe i will get some frozen peas and chill my feet maybe the hands the next infusions my mo and nurses seem to have never heard of icing though i think i might have enough wits about me to get back to some meal planning been soooo off track and have gained a little since chemo started not big changes just rebalancing school starts next week so been working on the supply lists haircuts seeing if clothes fit filling in calendar etc looking forward to being back in a routine well i finally has my last chemo yesterday i had to wait a week due to low wbc it was down to 88 and it went back up to i am so glad to have the part behind me now wait to get thru the and hopefully recover more before rads start on july 20 i go next week for a ct scan at the rad onc i am also going to have a ct scan with contrast this week or next since i had some questionable spots show up on a previous scan prior to chemo they want to make sure all is clear now that chemo is complete i signed up for a clinical trial biophosperous i think about how the bones react and hopefully ward off future bone cancers i am considering another trial as well but i have to wait to see if i am still i have not gotten my period during chemo except for one in the beginning but if it comes back then i will participate in that one as well malleme i am mid 40 s and was also prior to chemo i was told it may take 6 weeks before it comes back i am okay with it not coming back though one thing i miss i do know a few people who had bc at a younger age and after treatment have happy belated anniversary mine was last saturday 17 yrs we actually went out with some friends and had a grown up date it was a lot of fun sakura 73 glad to hear taxol 1 is done the were different for me than on ac mostly bone joint pain day my nails have become discolored a little but

am sorry to all that i have missed posting to directly the kids schedules have me so busy i have much time to read and catch up next week will be better hubby and son go to canada for a week of male bonding and fishing on friday and oldest daughter goes to camp on sunday for 2 weeks be just me and my 7yr old for a week of mommy and daughter time it should be good for everyone sorry for the long post hope everyone has a great day and those with have minimal ones me included cyndi pollyagain it is scary to start chemo and to wait for results imaginative worrying yes been there and done that when all this started for me i kept a notebook of things and when i found myself worrying about something i would write it down so i have to keep thinking about it also during chemothe notebook was very helpful to track symptoms so i could compare timing of side effects and select the best medication if needed please look into icing your fingers and toes during the taxotere infusions i used insulated lunchsacks and frozen peas not everyone gets nail problems with tax but they can possibly be avoided altogether with the icing please come back and tell us how it goes this group has been great and it such a good source of information for managing the chemotherapy experience here is a link about the nails and frozen glove docetaxel taxotere onycholysis nail problems i was 47 at dx i had a blm w r pet ct scan no mets my oncotype score was 23 i decided with my onc to proceed with tcx 4 my onc believed that if the chemo was beneficial to me since i was in the grey area it would provide me with additional protection i am happy with my decision it as bad as i imagined i get sick once even gained weight unfortunately with treatment 27lbs i did lose most of my hair my tx finished 09 and now i have about inches of hair and i daringly go without a wig i had a hsty my first flw up after the hsty i had lost 22lbs i am now on an ai not sure i am happy with the side effects insomnia and joint pain i will be really concerned if i start to gain weight the cost of the ai is much more as well 5 tamox vs 100 ai so i will need to discuss with my onc next week whether or not it is a good idea for me to go back on tamox i take zometa for fear of the risk of onj which i think would be worse for me than the bc although i feel i have thrown everything i can at this i am still depressed and scared most days i am on an anti depressant i wish i could find the peace so many of you strong women have found admirable wishing everyone the very best pbrain a little more than 7 weeks past last taxol and that tingling squeezing feeling in shoulders throad hips is about gone just had 18 of 33 rads no real side effects yet have much energy and not very good at making myself do all bookwork i need to do but am feeling soooo much better for those doing think 5 nepogen one nulasta which is like a time release the nepogen is a lot cheaper too i think 10 cost about what one nulasta does i looked it up last fall got doctor to give me prescription and hubby did the nepogen at home only needed about 4 during 12 taxol doses not nearly the joint and bone pain claridin worked well for me someone suggested it on the nov thread and there was a clinical trial that seemed to indicate that it worked for most hugs to all oh yes ive lost about 18 lbs since i started treatment not sorry about that mostly because of lack of appetite and bad taste in mouth because of a c and taxol appetite is coming back and bad taste is gone but i think my stomach shrunk on herceptin every three weeks and have been since may my last ac was in april so been a while my last abraxane was july 3 my side effects from hercepting seem to be terrible joint pain and stiffness extreme fatigue heartburn and insomnia the fatigue and joint pain are all the time but the heartburn and insomnia lessen after about the first week after treatment i have found it to been somewhat depressing because i thought i would feel better than this by now and still several months left i have some dizzyness but i know if it is the herceptin or the lunesta that i take because i sleep from the herceptin definitely ask your doc to do the muga scan since having the heart symptoms all so hard on the heart also hesitate to tell the onc everything be sure they listen to you i took decadron by mouth the day of taxotere then had more iv just pror to infusion then in a tapering dose for 4 days to keep away nausea and fatigue i get shakey ut had a hard time sleeping for sure if i ever need it again i would be more generous with the sleep aides why was i so afraid of them the other thing i usuall had red face and chest for a few days after i ended up hospitalized twice during taxotere once for febrile neutropenia and the second time for an infection which was never found i hope you are getting neulasta or neupogen i started to get neupogen after my first hospitalization my hair relly come back til after the taxotere was odne 2 years later it is full and wild i love it good luck you are now passing your half way mark safe journey fists up hi debbie so sorry to hear about your heart problems i can honest say i know how you feel when i was reading your post i almost though i was reading about myself im 53 and never had any problems before very active i was x d with breast cancer dec 2004 tumor was cm stage 2 er neg 13 lymph nodes removed 1 with a trace of cancer did 4 rounds a c adriamycim and cytoin and 4 rounds taxol developed lymphdema in jan 2006 then in oct 2006 i also had problems with shortness of breath went to doc and was taken by ambulance to hospital and was attempted with cardiomopathy had echo done and my ejection friction was only 33 was set home with med in feb 2007 awoke up with chest pains and shortness of breath dh took me to er and was attempted with congestive heart failure i was swollen also fluid around heart and lungs with the med for the heart it has lowered my blood pressure too low plus i have a ventricular tacycardia so the end of feb i had to have an icd implantable cardioverter defibrillator put in all of my heart problems have been from the chemo adriamycin it is all very upsetting it has slowed my down a lot but all you can do is take one day as in comes and live it to the fullness im on a low sodium diet 1500mg a day thats not much let me tell ya this is something that needs to make people aware of i was like you never though i would have heart problems darleen rabbit i have read other threads i recall seeing anyone differentiate that only taxotere does and taxol does not cause the nail problems etc i believe a fair number of people reported icing fingers helped and others not probably similar to the polar cap working for some and not others an individual thing good luck tomorrow certainly hope taxol is better for you sorry going through all this please be afraid to take something for it i am on tamoxifen also i use effexor for anxiety and used for hot flashes from tamoxifen been through so much and you get a chance to start to recover from one thing when something else comes at you i hope you are able to find some relief please let us know what you find out and how you are doing we are always here for you julie 2timeri go weekly for my taxol but so far 5 it has been much easier than the a c i got a weird tingling round my mouth 4 5 it stayed through next day asked mo if this was a type of neuropathy my fingers toes are fine it is hopefully will just last a day or so after treatment like it did this week my bone pain is primarily my knees owie on the of luck i bet do ok i got a rash after 1st taxol tx mo told me to use cortisone 10 or it will not hurt you it is a standard go ointment for

work too long on me glad most of you are doing well i miss it it was very and i felt good on it and except for some growing neuropathy did well until my cancer got smart and started progressing again two and months 3 cycles sure last long so now on carboplatin and irinotecan camposar have only had one so far spent a week in the hospital because my port was abscessed had to be removed and a picc line put in bummer i like my port know if i can get another one in a few weeks or not also had massive sinus occlusion infection but was asymptomatic except for swelling in left eye no taste numbness

for you hi ladies i lost my eyelashes and use an eyeliner on the top lid i use a grey and smudge it unfortunately the taxotere keeps my eyes so watery it is gone in 10 minutes when i began this journey i was doing some retail therapy and splurged on some erno lazlo products i figured i was saving on hair products cuts and colors they have a product called c 10 75 i really does lighten and remove age spots from the face i use mac cosmetics which is a heavy foundation and also concealer for the spots i am no longer using the concealer and can even now go with just a moisturizer w mac powder since using the lazlo products my skin is really looking good it helps since i gained 20 lbs and have the moon face beware though their products are pricey but i have not bought anything without having them give me a sample to try everything i tried i liked and bought i have not used the mac blush or eye shadow does it stay on well i heard they are coming out with mineral face powders wait to try them as for lipsticks i like the max factor 2 step color lipstick it stays on for about 18 hours if i put it on at night even after washing my face it is still there in the am debbie hi calamtykel just wanted to let you know that you always gain weight during chemo i lost 20 pounds right after dx and during the first months of chemo and pretty much kept it off since then there were a couple reasons for this i stopped drinking wine except for very rare occasions as it taste good and i figured my body need it adriamycin one of the chemo drugs made me a bit nauseated and many foods were less appealing i suspected i want to go through recon and i knew that my d breasts in the past were helping to balance my heavier hips and tummy in the future i want to maintain a lower bmi and look good even without breasts although i do wear puffies in public i lost all my hair and my exposed features look better when carrying less weight so that was motivating i kept walking and eating healthy foods throughout chemo some days i was too tired to go on walks but most days i got some exercise and now that done with chemo i want to maintain a healthy diet and a healthy weight good luck to you leeanne you might ask your doctor about getting a prescription for your stomach acid trouble been on otc prilosec for years but needed to get something stronger for chemo on weekly taxol carboplatin and i have any nausea but i do have more acid reflux than usual in 2005 i did ac x4 taxol x4 with neulasta shots the taxol made me achy and the neulasta made my bones hurt because weekly dosages are smaller i needed neulasta so had any bone pain yay my fingertips and toes are a little numb and tender but nothing too bad the worst side effect is fatigue but i think more the carboplatin just had my sixth of 12 treatments so halfway done really a slog but i remember how i got through it in 2005 keep putting one foot in front of the other and eventually you come out on the other side btw not that my 2005 chemo work i got a new primary in 2007 hi susiemtn did you have any abdominal surgery previously i had my ovaries removed feb so i could take ais instead of tamoxifen since then i periodically got severe stomachs pains and would eventually go to the er at the end of may 2010i went again and they said maybe a bladder infection gave me antibiotics and sent me away a week later it came again and worse still unbearable and i have a high pain threshold turned out i had scar tissue growing from my surgery site for the oopherectomy and it had twisted around my intestine basically strangling it they found out with a ct scan show on a stomach xray or ultrasound i had emergency surgery within 30 minutes of them finding the problem that too was a pain that came and went mysteriously but it could have had very serious consequences other than that i agree with everyone else you promise you be one of those who jumps to the big c conclusion with every ache and pain but so hard not funny thing was with my abdo issues i never once thought it might be cancer weird eh hello lurked here off and on for a year have learned much and gleaned much via your shared experiences and finally registered so i can say thanks i am the caregiver for my wife who was diagnosed stage iii she did tch 6x tc prior to double mastectomy 7 nodes involved as well continued with herceptin and did rads x37 as of this spring we were told she was ned even though the doc never would give her a pet to confirm that despite our requests he tried her on two different more on this later and she went into a profound depression with each so she went to tamoxifen she was hospitalized in jan 10 with a pulmonary embolism perhaps caused to herceptin and has been on coumadin ever since with regular monitoring of inr in may 10 she fell for no reason hit her head with no loc and i took her to er in case of a brain bleed due to being on coumadin er doc came back with the worst kind of goodnews badnews no brain bleed but found a small 14 mm met on her brain her onc wanted craniotomy wanting a second opinion i sent her records to and case was presented to their brain tumor board they strongly suggested gamma knife said no ned for drilling her head and her onc happy when we chose that route radiosurg in june was successful now a week before christmas we learned that she has several small lymph nodes in her chest that were hot along with a small tumor on one adrenal gland onc was really cavalier in telling us this made up treatment plan on the fly while we were there first wanted to treat endocrinologically by giving her a shot to force menopause and then starting an ai when i reminded him that he had put her on last year and she postmenopausal then either he looked back and said oh yeah i now understand that are contraindicated premenopause but that little detail escaped the purview next he says go with xeloda tykerb between futzing with the insurance co for it was 10 days before it got here the day before it arrived i researched xeloda and discovered an fda black box warning for interactions with coumadin the same coumadin that the same doc prescribed for her and monitored blood levels every few weeks for the last 10 months he bother to tell us about that little detail when writing it and when i caught it and called the nurse said that it could have caused her inr levels to skyrocket decent poss of brain bleed internal bleeding tough to control etc thanks for reading this far i promise the point is coming when we first learned of the new mets i immediately made an appointment at a major university breast cancer center hours away from us for a 2nd opinion they got us in on the 23rd a wonderful onc spent a few hours with us until 7 pm when everyone else had left to begin their holiday and she presented some clinical trials that she thought would benefit my wife so that we might keep xeloda available later keenly interested in one study wherein 2 of the 3 arms would get tdm 1 we were told that if my wife started the xeloda we had at home be ineligible so we pondered it over the holiday while starting tykerb without xeloda likely sign up for the study tomorrow and make the trip to this clinic once a week or more we have horses and several pets so staying in another city longterm would be challenging logistically here lies my main question for the wizened folks here has anyone been treated by an onc consider their primary with said onc being in a city not very near we really have had it with the onc seen locally since diagnosis and would love to fire him and use this new doc but i have concerns on how it would work out should my wife need to be hospitalized emergently and i schlep her hours to be treated i want the very best care for her of course especially with this new progression and her current guy seems disengaged as well as making dangerous mistakes x2 any thoughts on this or any other part of the journey recounted above would be greatly appreciated and god bless you all stay strong hi sorry to hear about your diagnosis there is a lot of info on this board do you know what kind of chemo you will have there is chemo threads that you could follow and read of people experience my cancer was over 5 cm and er pr and her 2 i went through 6 round of chemo 3 fec and 3 taxorete the side effects were different on each chemo while on fec the infusion was longer and the biggest pain was nausea it would last for days after chemo day i took meds for the nausea as needed i had food gravings and some food taste good at all i was given neulasta shots 6 shots one after each chemo to help with white blood cell the side effects in my case lasted only for 3 days and i was back to my normal self minus the hair which fell on day 16 after first chemo on the second part i had more bone and joint pain big c issues and some thrust in my mouth the stomach was better and i could eat anything the pains lasted again 3 days because of the steriods that i was given water retention was an issue everyone reacts differently to chemo so once you know which chemo you will have it would be best to join one of the threads i know that helps me go through my treatment wishing you a pain free chemo treatment hugs my first post sigh been reading here since my diagnosis in november 2014 this is the only online site i am frequenting such great information posted and learning from others who have gone through treatments and of those going through them now had my first chemo dec 16 it was tough but made it through was pretty ill for 6 days now 2 is tomorrow am hoping be as hard as the first as some others have experienced just started losing my hair 4 days ago really coming out fast will probably have to have it shaved by the end of the week after one treatment the tumor is significantly reduced and lymph node swelling is way down as well appreciate all the personal insights and tips and tricks which i have borrowed going to try icing my feet and hands tomorrow during the taxotere to help with neuropathy and damage to nails everyone has problems with tamoxifen so let everything you read scare you i for one did have alot of problems at first insomnia weird dreams achy joint and muscles neausea you name it i think i have had the se but my mo worked with me and i have now been on tamox for 4 months and can say all the have worked themselves out just this last week i quit having hot flashes at first i thought i could not make it but my mo said give it time it would be ok and he was right i am now sleeping great again to me the insurance of the tamox is worth it good luck on your decision hi i have recently finished chemo and radiotherapy and am now on herceptin i developed mild lympoedema in my right arm a couple of months ago and have been given a compression sleeve i am keen to learn how to do simple lymphatic drainage but staff at the lymphoedema clinic are not sure that it would be appropriate for me to be taught that when i am still having active treatment ie the herceptin on the basis that it would encourage the movement of lymph around the body and any rogue cancer cells might spread i am a bit confused by this as i am being encouraged to exercise which i assume would also encourage the movement of lymph i took advice from a lymphodoema organisation which said that once chemo and radiotherapy was over it was probably ok to do the massage i am interested to hear about the experiences of other people who have lymphoedema and are on herceptin lynn hello mkay horrible how we always have so many life altering decisions yesterday my onctook meoff of arimidex and gave me a script foraromasin because of my severe joint pain before arimidex i took tamoxifen and i stand that buti suffered more on arimidex than tamoxifen in fact i cursed cried and sulkedevery day while taking them and each time i saw my onc beg to be taken off so forgive me but i even imagine being at the end of the road and wondering if i stop at the same time i totally understand your fears you probably feel like if you do anything your cancer will come back well i tell you what to do but on this side of the grass say rejoice done get healthy again exercise do all the things these drugs prevent us from doing and live again there are certain antidepressants that should be avoided while on t but not all from an article in science digest feb 2009 although many antidepressants have little or no impact on metabolism paroxetine a member of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ssri class of drugs is a potent inhibitor of the metabolic step that converts tamoxifen to endoxifen gabapentin is an medication also called an anticonvulsant it affects chemicals and nerves in the body that are involved in the cause of seizures and some types of pain using it for hot flashes appears to be an use effexor is an antidepressant in a group of drugs called selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ssnris venlafaxine affects chemicals in the brain that may become unbalanced and cause depression has anyone experienced edema with letrozole never been troubled with it before but now my feet and ankles swell basically daily been going on now for about weeks it happened on tamoxifen but that turned out to be blood clots no pain so am quite positive that not got a blood clot going again just swelling hi everyone back again after posting a few minutes ago i am on an anti depressant when needed and did gain a few pounds now feel nauseous so hoping to lose some of the few pounds with severe wrist pain i have from a and continuing with femara my general practiontioner gave me a script for physical therapy even though it might be neuropathy the physical therapist said all we can do is try and hope it helps i start mond wait yes i agree with you ruth mentally i stand the weight gain i only had not flashes once since starting femara full time in oct bc and the fight after bc really is crap sorry no other way to put it hugs to all again have a peaceful day hi all i am doing my 4th and final ac dose this week in 2 weeks i will start 12 weekly doses of the taxol and herceptin i was wondering what kind of other experienced with the taxol compared to ac should i expect the same amount of feeling run down i am aware of the neuropathy se does this set in gradually or pretty suddenly any experience sharing is welcom thanks bonnie hey donna when i was on weekly taxol my hair thinned very slowly never a big suddenfallout as with dose dense taxol after 2 weeks i could run my fingers through my hair and get a bit of a shed it sort of followed male pattern baldness in fallout you might want to wait before clipping your hair to see how it goes overall say 50 of my hair fell out from the top of my head much less at the sides and back i ended up clipping it short and wearing a wig never heard of avoiding garlic with taxol never took tykerb so know now cruel and unusual punishment ask your onc but really i imagine giving up garlic i have had first dose of falsodex one in each cheek i am having issues with nausea and vomiting was put on zyprexa last tuesday to help with that i go next tuesday for the second time for injections my physician said the side effects would be similar to tamoxifen i did not have any side effectswhile ontamoxifenso am hopeful will be able to tolerate the falsodex treatment i have had lots of differenttreatments with and chemos nothing has worked for an extended period so was excited to read that someone had had success with falsodex for 5 years lynette i just finished by first fec tx yesterday they gave me the e red colour drug first and it was fine but it will turn your urine pink for a couple of days and can turn your veins too next was the f 5fu which was just pushed in over 5 minutes and yes take ice cubes or popsicles for this lastly the c which i found burned a little and it runs over half an hour but a heat pack helped alot it also can cause a freeze headache at the end and teary burning eyes and sinus pressure i only had a little tearing and a major headache afterwards i was good for about 3 hours after and then had a major headache nauseated and then was sick 3 times through the night but pretty good today just still slightly nauseated at times hope this helps but remember everybody is different good luck lee no tree on my ipad no bar either dizzy definitely ice with taxol i used frozen peas and four insulated lunch bags all different the feet ones were larger i stuck the peas in the end put my foot in and zipped the bag around it did the same thing with my hands and no nail issues at all during chemo late into herceptin my nails did get really thin and lift a little and were really tender i even kept them iced during herceptin i certainly amused the people in the office looking at me with four different bags that i got at garden ridge for 2 each i was too cheap to pay for matching ones i did not have mouth sores i liked my chemo sessions too my husband went to the first one and once he i was ok to drive myself i went on my own then i liked just chilling with tv or a movie always took my kindle but read much with fingers in ice people always offered to go but i went early in the morning and would have felt like i had to entertain them it was nice to just take it easy and maybe doze a little kay g be glad you have that reaction to the vaccine i think it is a good sign ok i read so many pages to catch up i remember what i was going to say lol making an appointment with an orthopedic guy tomorrow to check my neck shoulder area it has gotten worse and is time to figure out what it is special k how is the prolia and side effects my density is still normal but has dropped since last one two years ago pcp wanted to put me on atelvia i decided not too onc says when he switches me to an ai he will give me prolia automatically i really want that either trying to do weight bearing exercises and take supplements and speaking of did any of you using them have hair thinning i would rather stay on tamoxifen if that is the case loopyloulee i had some swelling of my eyelids about day and my ankles were swollen from day my onc said a se of taxotere just what i wanted to be a fat swollen bald chemo patient tomorrowi do round 2 and the all gone ineresting how your onc does neupogen mine told me if i chose to do it it would be one shot a day for 10 days after chemo starting the day after i opted to do one neulasta after this round as i hate needles and think i could stick myself for 10 days see how the goes my onc also only checks blood levels if symptomatic fever and also the day before each round my last taxol was january 19 2009 and i still have neuropathy in my feet and my toenails still right i have a left foot drop as well my pcp says that at this point it will be permanent hi lemon asked me about menopause post oopherectomy i think there may be other threads about this too but this was my experience i had had a hysterectomy pre bc in 2008 for a huge fibroid when i was 47 but kept ovaries that was the prevailing advice then to keep them for heart and bone health etc in 2010 was dx w bc and all hormone tests showed me to be still premenopausal whatever that means so i started on tamoxifen tamoxifen caused my ovaries to think there was a lack of estrogen so they went into overdrive and my estrogen levels shot way up did lupron for six months hated it for a lot of reasons and then did ooph i stayed on tamoxifen for another year post ooph i think my onc wanted me to have the full year benefit of tamoxifen and really had no bad menopause symptoms during that year i was waiting for them but really nothing happened i started femara this past january and since then had worse and hot flashes because of this i think that the hot flashes are more from the femara than from the ooph or maybe a combination of the two i haven t had it tested yet but i imagine that my estrogen levels are probably very low or a state that you have while and on tamoxifen i think these hot flashes the joint pain and the fatigue are all a result of really low estrogen and perhaps femara all that being said i want this to scare anyone away from femara or the ooph these are annoying but i prefer them to a recurrence and i do things to counter them i eat well exercise and rest more and find it all manageable i also take omega 3 a probiotic and vitamin d i had a bone density test before starting femara a year post ooph and my bone density is better than average i could use to lose 10 lbs but my weight is in the range of normal and though cholesterol is up since femara no heart problems that i know of i am so relieved not to have these ovaries in anymore i think my body do well with too much estrogen horrible pms heavy periods fibroids gallstones etc i am also happy not to have to worry about ovarian ca or any other type of gyno cancer actually risk of ovarian ca is close to nil happy about that so say that the fear of catastrophic menopause may be exxagerated all ok hope this is helpful shari hi all sherri i love your new pic you look amazing juanelle have fun with your family on vacation and stay warm as for us we finally dug out of the snow storm but they are giving another possible storm so heard for may this coming monday into tuesday how strange this winter has been to all the newbies i welcome you all i trully hate that you have had to join the ranks of but i am so happy you found this thread all the ladies here are very supportive and will help and answer questions in anyway they can for me i celebrated my one year anniversary of being dx and having surgery in oct but i am quickly coming up on the one yr anniversary of completion of my treatment feb 4th i also take tamoxifen which i hate it makes it so hard to lose weight pam i hope you do better on the tamoxifen i will say i had some initial aches and pains with it but they have gotten better and stick around very long the worse thing i have had happen with it is i have developed crepitus what my doc calls it really just cracking and popping of the joints from lack of lubrication due to the estrogen that it being blocked and caused me key word to have some arthritic pain in my shoulders that i never had before i took it i hope in 4 yrs when i stop the med the pain will stop maybe not the damage may have been done but i guess a small price to pay for my life hugs renee hi teresa i never had taxol i did have 4 taxotere and then 4 a c i never suffered with any numbness in my hands or feet thankfully i lost almost all my hair i think kiwi head is a good name for the way i looked and my hair also go a lot lighter maybe because it was grayish right now i have about 3 inches of hair and back to my normal mousy brown the first inch and was really curly and i got a lot of compliments the rest is slightly wavy so i think going back to my normal limp straight hair darn just as full as it was before treatment and feels very healthy i wore hats instead of wigs take care karin thank you for your inspiration i sure which of those two werethe biggest gun or if there was a bigger one out there i have intestinal issues too tests say no cancer there but diarrhea every day since march and i believe both ac and taxol can rupture a weak intestine in truth the onc offered me a clinical trial where i will randomly get one of three chemos paclitaxol or ixabepilone these are all in the same family of chemo drugs is anyone else out there doing this trial how long have you been on it and how are you doing ruth apple big hugs to you while you wait picture yourself in that little bungalow and all that gorgeous blue water

your mom is there with you now and helping she will be there when you deliver if your mil understand have your husband talk to her my daughter had twins i stayed at the house one mil the easy going one stayed a few days but my daughter and twins were in hospital for 5 days so that was different the mil who is high maintenance her hubbies parents are divorced did not come til much later you really have to think of what is best for you and not feel bad about it i had treatment 2 of 12 of taxol today took longer had the back pain again and so they slowed the drip down which took the pain away but took a little longer luckily i had another good friend with me to pass the time they delivered little ham sandwiches cheetos and chocolate pudding cups they do this on the week of a holiday which is nice so done til monday will probably have my crash on wednesday again no neuropathy yet next week i just have blood work no dr appt so will just got o chemo after the labs i am half way through in terms of weeks 10 down out of 20 10 more taxol we can do this julie my daughter is doing well right now and is on temodar and avastin her ins co denied the temodar but her covered it have you filed an appeal with your ins co your doctor is your best resource to get it approved but failing that try contacting the pharmaceutical company and they may help pay for some of it there are a number of sites i am told that assist patients with getting financial help or getting drugs approved i know they are on here somewhere but sorry i know where my daughter just finished her first 5 days of temodar and was fatigued after day 3 and had constipation they say that those symptoms will now begin to wane so hopefully they are right i pray for everyone here that these treatments work many here are on tykerb and that may be another option if you get buy the temodar i would not buy it from india too dangerous a chance in my opinion it costs about give or take for 15 pills if you can find the financial means to pay for it yourself from your local pharmacy before we got approval from my plan i was calling all the local pharmacies around and the best price i found was at the acme savon pharmacy here in nj and that was for 15 100 mg capsules best of luck and keep in touch joyce peggy yes i think there are a lot of women out there who are getting from fillers rather than the drug one of the most used fillers is lactose if you are even a bit lactose intolerant the lactose in these drugs all the supplements that some take will push you over the edge i found out that i am actually allergic to lactose not just intolerant it makes my joints aches so badly so i have to check everything that i take my anastrozole has a minute amount of lactose in it which is why i have a bit of joint pain but willing to live with it for as long as it keeps me stable the cancer agency pharmacists are great they mind helping out patients especially when something interesting different such as research my local small town pharmacist is the same if i give him time he will research just about anything that i need info on cheers gg tink c tammy diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer 07 i was 2 months pregnantchemo fac beginning continued until july 07 took 1 month off to rejuvenate for birth of beautiful baby girl aubree 07 mastectomy began taxol because it was not safe to take during pregnancy began rads and continued taxol all done with chemo and rads had ct showing local recurrence in neck lymph node moved to stage iv2 08 began chemo of xeloda and ixempera initially shrunk lymph nodes determined no longer working and swithched chemo to abraxane avastin great improvement shown initially cough continually go worse until determined abraxane avastin no longer working had ct scans and tests to see what was causing cough saw pulmonologist determined that taxane chemo had caused damage to lungs extremely inflammed in airways and lungs had a brohcoscopy to determine this recommended i take time off from chemo to recover and regain strenght now on oxygen slightest exertion causes me to lose breath and leaves me gasping for air during 2 weeks some minor improvement pulmonologist says recovery is variable can take a few weeks to a couple of months return to oncologist to see about returning to chemo he wants to put me on gemzar cyboplatin my mother has been on gemzar for the past 6 weeks so far it has definitely been one of the easier ones compared to others she has been on havalen taxol xeloda she has some nausea and vomiting but pain is down energy is up as well as appetite she was losing weight constantly for a while there before gemzar i think it was mostly due to no appetite lots of vomiting but now she has been stable since starting gemzar im hoping she stays with stable boy for a longwhile its good to see her feeling better now oh and her hair is continuing to grow and has not fallen out which is a plus so if you do gemzar i hope its as nice to you as it has been to my mom good stillme i also heard that i would go through chemopause i thought great i am 49 years old my tubes are tied want children have children so might as well get menopause over with i have been perimenopausal for years now dealing with hot flashes mostly at night treatment 1 start my period 5 days later lasts for 5 daystreatment 2 my treatments are every other week start period 8 days later and still going and very heavy treatment 3 is this wednesdayso basically my system is all screwed up instead of hot flashes i now get the chills i went 11 days in between periods this time and i was always so regular on a 28 day cycle liz i take ativan for 5 days after chemo to help with the nausea but it help me sleep he only prescribed 1 mg wondering if i should double dose myself on it how much are you taking at a time my negative thoughts are always i am going to go through all of this chemo crap and probably get cancer again i am pissed there are no guarantees no matter what course you take in this fight against bc i am not going to worry about deodarants etc i am just going for moderation these days i think about all of the women that supposedly were doing the right thing and they are getting bc women that exercised regularly ate the right foods never smoked did the organic thing overdo the caffeine they get cancer i figure there will always be studies out there that you do this or that and if you listen to some of them it tells you that you should never eat any animal based products so basically become a vegan nope not going to happen god intended for us to eat meat he provided it to us and i am going to eat meat i guess what i am saying is if i took each and every one of the studies seriously then i would nevereat anything but plants drink nothing but water and never bath with soap which means i use laundry detergent i think you get my drift susan 13 sorry you are having such a hard time from what i have read the a c will make you lose all of your hair the taxol or taxotere will just thin out your hair so you could lose up to 50 of your hair on those chemo drugs of course if you do a c first then it really matter because you have hair going into taxol i am hoping my hair starts growing back while i am doing my taxol regimen judy gosh that must have been so scarey how are you doing now sue from fl i would think they would want you to wait in between treatments i say this because i had my snb they had me wait 3 weeks before starting chemo once i am done with chemo i am to wait 3 weeks before surgery after surgery i am to wait 3 weeks before starting radiation they want your body to get strong again after each type of treatment i think of any reason why you wait a month between chemo and radiation if that is what you want to do apple i use aquaphor also but i use a q tip not a cute tip just giving you a rash of crap first thing in the morning because i like you where do you get the glutamine powder diane i am on the same chemo treatment all for the purpose of shrinking my tumor so i could have a lumpectomy there is no change in risk factor if you do a masectomy or a lumpectomy radiation neither procedure reduces your risk of getting bc again or cancer in another area of your body since my risk factor be reduced by doing a masectomy i am definately opting for a lumpectomy one of the factors that women consider when chosing one procedure over the other is the radiation treatments it is easy if you live close to the hospital because you have to do rads for 5 to 6 weeks straight 5 days a week for those like kat 4pink tht lives hour drive from the cancer center radiation is not feasible unless she moved temporarily during treatment to an apartment close to the cancer center i think the chemo fog comes and goes i think it has anything to do with emend it is a se of chemo emend is supposed to be the wonder drug for nausea i also drink a ton of ginger ale but i found out when i was really nauseated that a coke would really settle my stomach quicker than anything i still drink my ginger ale because i really like it susan 13 i have thrush nor do i have a coating on my tongue but i have certainly lost most of my taste buds i am finding it really difficult to cook since i spice everything to taste and lately i have been overdoing it a little bit on the spices according to my hubby i want to only eat spicy foods like mexican food indian food etc because at least i can taste them somewhat so how long is this se supposed to last i took tamoxifen for 5 years with minor side effects hot flashes and vaginal discharge i had no wt gain at all i took femara for 8 mos and then switched to aromasin for 1 years but stopped because of joint pain wt gain high cholesterol dry eyes low thyroid trigger fingers heel pain etc been off meds since oct 2007 i still have high chol low thyroid both of which i take meds for hand knee and heel pain i have any of these symtoms prior to the meds i am 57 so i guess it could be aging but more convinced that the aromasin and femara started them hope this helps you see that you are not alone good luck hugs cathy well taxol does certainly suck i admit the ac was worse for me since i dread nausea more than anything else and it left me absolutely flattened but this lovelytaxol well it hurts my legs knees feet shins you all know the drill taken many types of pills to combat it and the only thing that really works is knocking myself out it seems a little better today heres my question does the pain lessen over time i can stand a couple of days of this but it makes me cringe to think of weeks i had 8 weeks of dose dense a c and then 12 weeks of taxol the a c caused a host of problems that when away when if finished and i started tax right away i have anything but muscle pains in my legs during taxo a lot of women have an allergic reaction you sound like a friend of mine who did have all of the side effects she had her chemo at mass general in boston and they said she had an allergic reaction and switched her to another chemo agent i suggested calling your oncologist and asking her him whether an allergic reaction or if the administration is to rapid are they pumping it in too fast hello sosisters i love that everyone is posting been enjoying my friday off especially since i have a colonoscopy i actually started drinking all the yucky stuff will just save it for sept still having mammo and annual exam next week get results of my all clear mammo until august anyway patty why you made your appointments

ronniekay i love that throughout all this crap you have retained your wonderful sense of humor i am also questioning why the herceptin prevent the recurrence not to mention the famera i guess we know the answers to those questions i keep wondering why i had so many problems with my heart i will always be convinced that the chemo caused all those problems and i wonder if i have a recurrence if i would even consider chemo again we all hate this crappy bc and that you are having to journey this road again now about your new boobs for next year turns out they have a topless pool at the mirage

like frozen ice blocks an onc told me last week to get the powder instead of the capsules i was taking and take two huge teaspoons with water 3x a day i do think it helped with the neuropathy loved

offing hi everyone just completed my 2nd chemo of t c today i got the same nurse as last time and i was thrilled i have a port so i need a nurse that can find a vein easily and my girl my husband came with me this time my mom came the first time i was given an antivan for anxiety and 3 zofran for nausea these were oral then she put a bag of saline in my iv while we waited for the cytoxan and taxotere she did the cytoxan first and then the taxotere it took about 3 hours and i had no immediate i drank two 16 ounce glasses of water during the treatments and had 3 frozen fruit bars to try to help with the mouth sores i read that somewhere and it helped during my 1st chemo i have any my hair started falling out day 14 and i had it cut three times before i cut it like a pixie this past monday i washed it today and it is falling out some more but i still can throw some mousse in it and cover the holes i will be lucky ifi can hold on till saturday i hope so then have it cut to the scalp it really seemed to work for me to go gradually with my hair it was down to my shoulder blades and then i got it cut to the base of my neck and then to the top of my neck and then the pixie it helped me wrap my head around my new look i also have a sister that is a beautician so she can do it when i need her to and she charge me i know alot of you just shave it off and i think great you can do that but for me it just was to drastic amazing how individual this journey is for everyone to everyone my well wishes and prayers go out to you all michelle hello ladies checking in i hope everyone had a terrific christmas not much new is only about inch all around and my last treatment was in july humpf but my eyebrows and eyelashes look great so i still wear the wig to work and a baseball cap everywhere else i have lots of aches and pains but not sure how much of it is from chemo or just the tamoxifen my knees creak and groan like an old lady my ankles ache my hips ache and my back frequently hurts oh my all this and i just turned 40 wow i hope everyone has a safe new to a terrific 2011 hi katie thank you for responding i want to sound stupid what are mets i had my chemo first time 2nd now i am just on hormonal therapy i have been on tamoxifen arimidex faslodex and now aromasin i have a real problem with nausea with these drugs except for the faslodex which was a monthly injection but the cancer returned last year to my lung so i guess that one work very well when were you diagnosed look forward to hearing from youellie hi everyone i had my last tac on sept 19th rounds followed by 5 wks of rads and although been working for a year i just now feeling normal tac was very hard on me with weight loss of 35lbs since i eat my muscle mass was gone been a long haul but so far so good on tamoxifen now and have lots of aches and pains which is a se but here kim on the thetaxotere toes i still have neuropathy in my toes and feet also muscle weakness in my legs i really think that the taxotere did a number on my legs and feet it is not too bad now but i do have extreme sensitivity to heat and cold which makes pedicures painful hot showers out of the question and dipping my feet in the cold water after a long hot hike a little daunting i hope yours improves soon i think with the thermogram it is more important on who reads the scan the who is performing the scan my full body scan was 400 as well the recent breast and lower limbs scanwas 250 i was having pain issues in my legs kira yikes glad you know to treat right away and get relief vivre do you have the aches only on one side or both i have an infection but a lot of postnasal drip from taxol it never really went away and i guess i am used to it one amalgan filling left as well and an ill fitting crown the aches are on both sides with tinnitus and crunchy noises that sounds rather funny but i know how to explain otherwise i just got diagnosed with taxotere associated alopecia yesterday this sucks geez been away far too long so much suckiness to catch up with debc gosh woman i am so glad your mri came out clean i bet you heard the angels shouting alleluia alleluia or was that you

confusion on fruits and veggies anything with a seed is fruit sure southern figured that out by now the one thing i remember learning in school oh so many years ago and no one ever asked me if i were pregnant before starting chemo or any other treatments i feel slighted of course i was only 58 when i was dxd oh and i was a grandma my dh had a vasectomy when i was 27 after our third child was born you can figure out the numbers on how long ago that was i let him get one after the second one because i said we were too young well i got pregnant when my 2nd child was 8 months old i remember sitting in the rocking chair with the new baby while dh took his mom back to florida and crying i thought what am i going to do with three little ones a good thing i had three cuz i love all of them my second one is the only one who has given us grandbabies my oldest one is not married and i think she wants children anyway my third child is my gypsy child and i think she and her dh want any they have a life i tease them but i feel if a couple want children there choice plus cheaper to only have two grandkids you know christmas etc end of story about having children i told my dh right after my third one was born get the vasectomy now i remember if i had to sign a paper but sure i did after his surgery he too comfy my friend and i wereplotting to make him hurt even more for all he had put me through three labors although it was too soon for sex a roll in the hay i decided that put on my sexiest nightie to entice him into you know what seemed to me have a little pain from well you know it

dawney must be a huge relief tink i have swelling too on the left side the breast is smaller and should not fill the bra cup but does most days because of he swelling end up with a line across the nipple and then aching along the side exercise helps but also hurts becaus ei am working that part of my body scares the crap out of me especially with regards to flying so i am doing lots of exercizing and hoping tingling and pain not so much the arm as the ribs just alongside he breast could be much worse though so i remember to be grateful every day teklya you can do it split the dose 10 mg in am and 10mg in pm think positive exercize and just be self aware rememebr that the tamoxifen is helping you to stay cancer free we will walk you through it start slowly your body will need some time to adjust and adapt to it so be gentle with yourself i got my prescription the day before radiation and started it as soooooooon as my blood results came back from checking to see if i was menopausal or not y oncologist beleive me anyhow i jumped in with both feet i was emotional but i think it was the stress of the radiation more than tamoxifen sleep is a problem for me but it was before breast cancer too so no surprise there i also use glycine to help my sleep but melaonin helps too and valerian for many people you can do it just jump off the diving board the rest of us are inthe water waiting for you hey penny and cristl i went in for 6 today lord i hate this stuff my nose is just like yours bleeds numerous times a day mentioned it to the onc they never said anything about an infection blood counts were really low today so had to take a neulasta shot first one gotten on taxol achey tired and tired of it both my thumbnails hurt the ring and pinky finger on the left hand oh good left handed the tips are both numb the skin on my feet is peeling badly and my eyes are so dry that if i wake up in the middle of the night and try to open them they hurt good news is that i seen my real oncologist today not the and he told me too that he find the lumps in my breast or under my arm anymore he put them down on my chart as a size 0 with an exclamation point after them lol told him to not get too excited really dry guy 6 more to go halfway woooooooooo hooooooooooluv hugs and prayersdeb my 4th and last tax completed today 1hr before took special anti sick pill called emend take 1 a day next 2 days used this last time and no nausea needle in first time had horrendous steroid pounding headache a reiki healer angel gave me a treatment during chemo and i was out like a light for about 20 mins headache gone amazing other occupants had never seen reiki and thought the woman was sent to put me in a trance it had the same effect afterwards we had a great chat about reiki and other healing techniques she booked me on the waiting list for aromatherapy in the therapy suite saying good bye and lots of hugs from all those wonderful workers was very hard like leaving a cosy and safe family of various and interesting characters a happy sad day my onc was not happy for me to be drained after chemo and surgeon will leave it for another month am now blown up to dd in month time will be gg given anti biotics to take for 5 days in case i have to fight infection strange happenings 999hugs mavis i am taking femara and before that tamoxifen i thought this was supposed to suppress estrogen if so why do i still have a greasy face and get zits i am 43 for sake and my hair has never been greasier as well and with this beard i have going yes the hairs are pale but i can see them and i just want to wax them off i feel like the bearded lady gross log in to post a reply hello all another really hot day here i noticed my breathing was labored today bummed because it likely means the fluid is returning to the left lung oh please god make this go away nancy glad to see got some fun things planned for your trip my birthday is sunday 27th so still both every year i try to make cheyenne days but with the heat and difficulty breathing and walking i likely make it church on sunday is being held at another sister church across town so i be going to church had hoped to take my yearly road trip but looks like be home with the air conditioning on lol the fatigue is pretty normal following treatment my former chemo peaks at 14 days and 21 days go figure six weeks later still tired so with you on getting on with it ha ha magdalene i like the idea of praying for our sisters on other threads i agree with nancy that they should come here though what this thread is for i know how to direct them here so maybe something we can all pray about i know that many people consider the lord until tragedy strikes guessing we just might gain a few over time as a result of the new char great news about your tests what a wonderful answered prayer surprised they recommended tamoxifen though i thought that was for women but i may be mistaken i was put on femara for four years after my chemo ended as it was for post menopausal women had no real side effects other than it kept me from losing weight i was amazed that once i went off of it i lost 60 pounds i had no idea blessings all sue jojo and forever sooo happy to hear your good news had to have two ultrasounds for lumps since starting treatment and the stress is awful makes me think i should have gone for the mastectomy my onc said we can discuss me having a mastectomy after treatment is done because of my age my dense breasts and my worry about recurrence considering it the whole body image issue is also a big deal and it an easy decision two weeks out from last chemo still have achy legs from the taxotere but otherwise tired but not bad my nails have lines across them one for each treatment and my hair is growing a little already this was my first week doing radiation and so far nothing im done in 10 minutes and you dont feel a thing i guess skin reactions come later hang in there girls the chemo will end this is all temporary and one day it will be nothing but a memory so how is everyone doing i gained weight while on tamoxifen but think it was the fact it put me into menopause more than the drug itself i did take it off later but now find that the older i get the more difficult it is for me to take off weight now i am almost hoping they take me off megace because for the last two days i have been eating like i am going off of it anticipating that ww will really work once i am off the medication however at the same time i want to stay on megace since other than being extremely hungry i have no ses at all and am really worried about what my next treatment might be so a catch 22 and i now know for sure that i am a stress eater because the scan results have me very stressed the only saving factor is that i have many bad things to eat in the house so i have been pigging out on ww ice cream novelties popcornand fiber bars and put real butter on my baked potato tonight my oncologist gave me a prescription during tx and it worked wonders for my nausea over a year later i have horrible leg pain thanks to tamoxifen so i take one before bedtime on nights that i can tell my legs will be cramping and aching this usually means i am either dehydrated or have had too much caffeine or both it does work hi ladies i too started seeing some hair growth during the foinal two taxol treatments i was so excited i ws telling my onc nurse and she said well unfortunatley it stay she was right it all came out i finished treatment on and now have the male pattern baldness thing going as well since finishing treatment i have lost most of my eyelashes and brows as well i am now on herceptin and arimidex last week my onc nurse said the white wispy hair i have coming in is normal and that the real hair will follow quickly so hang in there coming beth maybe keep what hair you have going but i hey jill thanks for the welcome yeah i usually hang out in the nov chemo group and yeah been talking about the libido thing so i know if you read my post in response to torchsong over there but the onc told me right up front to expect that i talked it over w my lover when i first started tx because we also wanted to know what was safe as far as well contamination from the chemo for him etc all i can say is thank god this is temporary i am not on any hormones being a triple negative hormones help us but since the chemo itself affects hormones well i guess the cause definitely a physical thing for me not emotional still definitely interested emotionally and psychologically like i said before about everything w this chemo been very frustrating when your mind says yes and your body says no i think so envious that you are almost done w the chemo i still have one more a c and then 4 taxol then 6 weeks rads 5 days a week which i read causes fatigue grrrrrr so i said to my onc so in about 6 months i can start living my life again his response was well i hope you will continue living your life all along hmmm interesting response easy for him to say but i suppose he is right just keep those decadrons away from me not sure what the exact dose is that they gave me have to ask curious now if they lowered it or are planning to jessee robin to be honest with you tolerating the weekly taxol better than i tolerated tamoxifen it gave me shocking joint pain so when it failed me i totally shattered well i was but seeking the silver lining my hard day comes on day 3 or 4 after treatment though the last few treatments kicking my ass as much maybe getting my taxol legs or maybe healing up i know the day of treatment is the hardest for me as the steroids cause me to feel jittery and i get to sleep until or am yuck and beware of how hungry the steroids can make you i make sure to have lots of good fruit and veg on hand as i want to eat all the time for the 2 days following treatment your first taxol treatments will take about 4 hours as they do a slow drip at first to make sure you get any adverse reactions i just finished my 10th and it took about 2 hours start to finish they start with decadron steroid to keep you from getting barfy and famotidine proton pump inhibitor to suppress stomach acid that takes about 15 minutes then they throw in the benadryl 15 minutes and then time for the taxol i tried the hour drip but it gave me a headache so i do the full dose in an hour and a half now no headache and time enough for a good nap after the benadryl get the three hour drip at first try whittling the time down on each successive treatment depending on how well you tolerate the taxol now that kiddo is back in school i get chemo in the morning then take the rest of the day for myself no chores back on duty after school be on taxol for the time being my tms are dropping every week and i think we are going to try the stronger next good luck to you truly the weekly schedule is so much kinder than dose dense and more effective too good times jennifer good evening popping in from september stars hope all doing ok and hitting too hard the in answer to your query on fec i had dexamethasone 2 x 2mg tabs breakfast and lunch starting day after chemo for 3 days making a total of 12 tabs over the 3 days they are given for their anti sickness benefits on taxotere its rare so suffer from nausea however dexamethasone is given for anti histamine benefit you start the day before chemo and again take for 3 days however double the dose 4 x 2mg tabs at breakfast and lunch total tablets over the 3 days 24 my chemo is tomorrow so currently buzzing on the 16mg worth of steroids taken today on the upside though stripped the beds done a sainsbury shop done 2 loads of washing and cooked spag bol for tea with some left over for the freezer for my bad days the stars mainly use fb but we do pop on to bcc and all of is are willing to give our opinions and tell you what did and work for us the main advice i can give for fec is at least 3 litres of water for several days before during and after it worked for me and many of the stars the last dose of fec has knocked a few of us off our feet with fatigue and for me the nausea was practically just a few hours after chemo that was it next day nothing take care everyone xx just finished my 4th weekly taxol treatment along with every three weeks of p h i am starting to notice my hair coming out more since the 4th treatment will it come out gradually or just thin out or next time i wash my hair it will all come out i really want the taxol to work for me but a little depressed about loosing my hair new to chemo been on hormonal for 5 years thankspatti sheila i too suffer from chronic pain due to multiple bone mets i started on tamoxifen lupron and zometa and currently had to switch to femara due to progression into bone marrow and new lesions where i imagine my new oncologist also took me off of zometa for awhile due to horrible reactions i was having not just shortly after but even 2 weeks after my infusion that actually has helped me a lot for pain i have been put on fentanyl and dilaudid for break through which just made me horribly ill so i found that i can do fairly well and keep the pain managed with naprosyn and tramadol daily and then occasionaly with hydrocodone mg to 10mg every 6hrs as needed i have also tried oxycodone but that seemed a little rougher on the stomach i have heard that oxycontin which is a longer acting version of the oxycodone is really good for bone pain i also feel that light exercise walking biking seems better than resting too much i hope that you are able to find something that works for you i find that dealing with the chronic pain can be very depressing at times i never realized i would have to deal with this when my mets really act up and i get really painful i also tend to get nauseated and lose my appetite pain management really helps not only with the above but also my attitude i wish you the best feel free to write me if you have any questions hugscat i have been on the tamoxifen for about a month now and i seem to be tolerating it much better than i did the femara or arimidex i still have the trigger finger and problem with my left arm and the neuropathy in my feet but it is better hair issues since my hair regrew i have had very little noticeable hair loss in fact it was kind of unusual never seeing natural hair loss now suddenly 15 mos post chemo and 9 mos on anastrozole i m noticing much more loss i have chemo curls my hair was stick straight before and it is very very fine but was much thicker post chemo i think someone here said they lost most of the original growth and had a different texture and color regrowth the gift that keeps on giving think gonna buzz it question for those of you taking arimidex i currently take tamoxifen which has taken away some of my libido on top of what going through menopause had already started doing to me with the reduced hormone levels now figured out that what my body may be low in is testosterone due to the symptoms that having since testosterone converts to estrogen through the help of the aromatase enzyme wondering what happens when that estrogen is not created due to the aromatase inhibitor does that leave your body with extra testosterone floating around have any of you noticed that because of testosterone that you have a good sex drive and responsivenss to stimulation even though the low estrogen induced vaginal dryness may make it difficult to follow through hi bevli i too am 5 weeks after my last docetaxel and my experience seems to be identical to yours in both symptons and timing as my eyes have ceased leaking too i would walk along a street with my eyes streaming tears running down my face which then made me have a runny nose so that i then looked like the proverbial kid the most ironic thing is that i usually take because i suffer from dry eyes having help and you realise that your eyelashes are functional as well as decorational just wish that they would grow back along with my eyebrows a wig can disguise your hair loss but not much you can do about no eyelashes or eyebrows that looks natural unless somebody can tell me otherwise how long do they take to grow back please living i am sorry to hear of the problems you are having i just finished my 9th round of taxol yesterday and although chemo is not a walk in the park not as bad as it could be the worst for me is the achiness and fatigue by the day after the last few rounds the achy feeling deep to the bones is not as bad so it does have its good days i was lucky enough to not have to take benedyrl just decadron before chemo and been sufficient nandy i have had terrible problems with my and nostril sores too i just started using a saline nasal spray and it has helped wonders so i would recommend trying that you can use it as often as you need to and it does keep the nasal area moistened and prevent scabbing as much hope that you will be in my thoughts and prayers and i hope the rest of the taxol rounds are better hugs belinda martha i have taxol 2 this week my worst ses have been like hvv said extreme exhaustion and i had major aches from head to toe on days no nausea at least with my 1st taxol tx and the yuck taste is pretty much gone my taste buds are still off and i have a sore spot on my tongue that keeps reappearing but nothing like the dirty sock taste yucky feeling i had with ac cornelia springi guess i should clarify the tamoxifen and why i choose to take it at the time of my dx i wasnt even close to going into menopause so they started me on tamox then i studied arimidex and choose to do the hysterectomy so that i could take it i took it for about 4 months and felt like i was 90 years old i choose to go back on the tamoxifen because i had such limited side effects with it i was told during my research phase that the adrenal gland in our bodies also produce estrogen as well so that is the reason i feel the need to take either tamoxifen or one of the i have my 2 yr followup in november and im considering trying the arimidex again but will certainly change back to the tamox if the are bad again the scars i had mine done laposcopically w vaginal assist to remove the uterus so the scars are very minimal i have about a on from the center of my belly button down and two tiny ones about the side of the end of a pencil eraser in diameter on each side of my belly button they arent bad at all and i see that they are fading more as time goes by ab strength issues i was extremely careful to do what the doctors told me to do or not to do and never felt that i actually lost any strength i took 2 wks off work and the only time i even noticed soreness was when i went back to work i scooted myself back and forth in my office chair all day didnt feel it at the time but that caused soreness just be careful and listen to the docs and you both will have great results as well if you decide to go this route let me know if there are any more questions that either of you have as i am always willing to help i went through most of my choices alone and didnt have the guidance of someone who had been down the path before me well i did have this web site which was a tremendous help hugsjule i just finished my 5 years of tamox 3 weeks ago and overall it really that bad before my ovary removal not by my ses were very mild hot flashes and some insomnia since my surgery over years now my ses increased and now include achiness but my oncologist feels more related to the loss of the estrogen rather than the tamoxifen for most people tamox is generally well tolerated they just post here anne hey sue i know about herceptin but taking mega doses of vitamin d helped me with joint pain side effects from arimidex they even did a clinical trial that showed effectiveness i was able to get off of naproxen and ibuprofen i am currently taking about 6000 iu a day it took about a week of mega dosing before i noticed a difference hope this helps melinda during chemo my periods stopped they came back after chemo i noticed before they returned and while on tamox that my hot flashes went away lack of estrogen causes hot flashes i like to think of it as estrogen withdrawal read flashes are worse for women abruptly placed into menopause and i believe it also read that the more fat on the body the less likely you will suffer from severe flashes fat stores estrogen and it is released into the body even if the ovaries are shut down so a woman can gradually step down into the no estrogen field so essentially heavier women are supposed to have an easier time of it anecdotally the only women in real life i know who really have flashes with menopause natural do have a significant amount of body fat but i am thinking of one woman in particular who takes hrt because they were so bad after menopause and she is obese so my real life experience really bare this out one way or another interesting stuff though holli glad the taxol went well i always end up sleeping hours from the benedryl after getting home jodi i forgot about the constipation issue with ac bad the first cycle when i did not take anything until too late i found taking a sennakot tablet daily starting the day of chemo keep things moving i also take gummy fiber supplements daily they are my daily candy i have to be at the infusion center at tomorrow am for blood draw then mo visit and taxol 5 i am bringing breakfast for my friend and myself we are going to have bagels with cream cheese and i have small containers of pineapple mango honeydew and watermelon we will get coffee there should be enough to share with the nurse also i was going to defrost some smoked salmon from christmas but my friend into lox so i will not defrost it just for me barbara wanted to drop in and wish everyone well i read the posts from you all every day sadly i have an outbreak of shingles on my neck and ear was supposed to get xgeva shot today but left cancer center with prescription for valtrex and pain medicine supposed to get taxol wednesday but thinking i wont b c of shingles the pain takes my breath away had shingles back in 2003 after tac i hate having a delay in chemo but it is what it is hope your break helps shazza and for every one else hang in sister was here for thanksgivng thawing out from frozen tundra in minneapolis we had the talk about how serious this cancer is for me she was so receptive and not in denial which helped me feel less anxiety about this disease the desert is nice but we have rain and cooler temps anything is better then 115 this summer anyway wishing you all good response to taxol and no side effects well minimal side effects pray these shingles i have go away they are ugly best i wear sweats a shirt and a hoodie i get super cold from all the fluids i pack in my bag snacks books a pc tablet all of my previous weeks my lidocaine cream for my port we also bring something for the hubby to do i was told during my first taxol infusion at mda to take the zofran but after the first one i i need the zofran for taxol and the constipation just worth the incase go ahead and experiement with the zofran and taxol you may not need it i bring a blanket with me i also throw all of my chemo clothes in the laundry when i get home i am kind of compulsive about hospitals and dirty laundry i know about aromasen but femara is a fertility drug so it stands to reason that is why we are having ovarian uterine problems i would say my ovary pain swelling of the abdomen and lower area along with pain and the feeling of going to start my period any minute with cramps is caused by the hormone drugs alone say that is my worset side effects on tamoxifen and now femara it surprise me at all that these drugs that produce eggs in the ovaries can cause periods again i like any of it and am tired of the swelling and pain i can see the only answer for me is a hysterectomy the delays on these drugs being successful for me is mounting good luck to you lizzie i know why some of this happens to quite a few of us and some have no problems at all does anyone have any history of this ovarian problem subsiding while on these drugs thnx help i have a dilemma and would love some input as i think my dh and ds are sick of me at this stage any of you who may have read my previous posts might gather that i have a big hang up about my weight and my onc told me that next to tamoxifen loosing weight would be the next most important thing to do to help prevent recurrence now been on the tamox a month and i can see the importance of it for me i was concerned that weight gain is associated with tamox but so be it however when i was with my onc last tuesday he prescribed lyricia for pain associated with nerve damage which was caused by taxol during chemo now i read the leaflet that came with the lyricia and was a bit concerned to see that weight gain was one of the most common so i checked up on some patient reviews on this med and was very concerned to find that a large proportion of the reviews major weight gain as a negative se so i decided that having just taken two and a half days of lyricia i was not going to continue with it dh and ds are of the opinion that i should take it and see but judging by the reviews the weight gain is excessive and almost immediate i really cannot cope with more weight gain i feel so inadequate already because i cannot motivate myself or have enough self control to shed the almost 100 excess pounds that i have i knew that losing weight while on tamox was going to be a challenge and i want to compound it by taking another drug with a similar se i would prefer to tolerate thepain the only problem with that is that it can be difficult to walk and exercise when my limbs are achy you know this thing about losing weight has me depressed i got through an unexpected cancer diagnosis sudden surgery resulting in loosing my left breast a staff infection following surgery a port placement that was infected and that was not used as a result 4 ac and 4t dd chemo with severe side effects complete hair loss how i missed my eye lashes 15 rads dd with bolus and dealing with foam bits thati have to remember to stick into my bra i got through all that and kept it together but now really loosing it because of my weight been yoyo dieting for 20 years how am i going to succeed now i am so well experienced at failing at this and even though i should be able to do it because of the really serious consequences i am just scared sorry about this rant but i just have no one to turn to and so down and stressed which just makes me feel like eating i really upset my dh today too because i was sooooo negative and now he is a little cross with me because of deciding to stop the lyricia too i want it to be a year ago at least then i was just trying and failingto lose weight so that i could find clothes that would fit me not so that i was trying to avoid cancer just joined this forum good idea i too am on tamoxifen and have been on it since february 23rd i finished my chemotherapy on february 2nd i get hotflashes at different intervals throughout the day and sometimes they are horrible ones and find i need to turn the fan on me and then i will have these moments i am getting too cold and have to turn the fan off and no hot flashes drives my husband nuts turning fan and ac off and on loli am getting muscle and joint pain but do not know if the possibility still exists it could be related to taxotere i was told that the pain muscle ache from this drug could go on and on for over a year after chemo ends oh yes about vaginal dryness big time and driving me nuts what is this about slippery stuff you make mention of for vaginal dryness charmaine hi ladies been quite a while since posted anything been reading trying to catch up on some of the more recent posts hard to believe that a year has passed since many of our diagnoses for the most part been doing really well with everything for me the chemo was the absolute worst part of my treatment especially the taxol thankfully most of my ses went away fairly quickly after i finished chemo all except the neuropathy it is much better now but still not completely gone i had my bilateral mastectomy on may 29 and then did 33 rounds of rads i finished radiation august 13 currently i have to go in once a month for a zoladex shot and take a daily femara pill so now i seem to find myself in this land it is weird but finding it odd not to not have my life dictated by doctor appts treatments ses etc i mean a good thing but kind of hard to adjust to does that makes sense to anyone else i also find myself worrying about what if i feel so good after all the crap been through and i really am doing good but i help thinking is it going to come back spread etc how do you stop thinking those thoughts well thanks for letting me ramble so glad to read that most of us doing pretty damn good to our continued health cat im going from tamoxifen to femara starting tonight at least we have different medicines to try if this doesnt work and i get worse neuropathy bone and joint pain ovary problems while on tamoxifen i wii try aromasin after that if amytning worsens me to the point of more disability i will chuck it all and move on with my life i see you are stage 3 also and neuropathy also me too good luck like you i just want to get my hormones in check and keep it that way until the side effects become conducive to low quality of life its hard to not feel like a failure but we just all need to do the best we can abd if that doesnt allow us a decent quality of life then just move on no stress no guilt good luck 345grace msphil that is very encouraging thank you thank you thank you now off tamoxifen and switched to aromasin now so i anticipate the s will be around the same maybe a bit more joint bone pain 3 years on tamoxifen and hot flashes night sweats weight gain are actually the worst symptoms so complain about tamox really juli i would think long and hard before doing something so aggressive especially if your cancer was an early stage while it may make sense for cancer reduction there is so much more to consider than just the oncology point of view gone through natural menopause and in my opinion menopause is for the birds not happy with effects at alll going through a surgical menopause has to be even more difficult getting a good sleep has become a rarity libido is diminished vaginal dryness and fed up with all the aches and pains i do use vaginal hormone creams that help with the dryness but they can be messy used herbs to try to help with the hot flashes and sleep difficulties they work reliably i like the fact that women have to go through this and truly would be happy to go back to being premenopausal breast cancer or not if you are really worried about reocurrence rather than remove the ovaries you could opt for the temporary suppression of them with drugs like lupron or zoladex then you could at least get a feel for what menopause would be like and tamoxifen alone is the treatment of choice for many oncologists mine never felt a need to mess with my ovaries whiile i was still premenopausal unfortunately i went through menopause while i was on it i started tamoxifen in dec 10 and had some side effects for a few weeks but they did taper off i had mild hot flashes warm flashes i guess until june 11 when i had a hysterectomy oopherectomy i had nothing for two weeks after the surgery then bam i was having 30 40 hot flashes a day very severe and almost made me crazy i have also been on effexor since starting tamoxifen as the pharmacy did not recommend me staying on the wellbutrin i was on i had been on mg of effexor but when the terrible hot flashes began went up to 75mg it did not help one bit the hot flashes were every bit as severe as they had always been i started gabapentin about 2 months ago and finally i have some relief i would say down to about 5 flashes a day and they are mild compared to what they were i went back to mg of effexor because i want to be on more than i needed when it helping the flashes at all since my surgery i have gained about 15 lbs who knows what caused it tamoxifen effexor surgery total and complete lack of estrogen could be any one of them or any combination of them just wanted to let you all know that gabapentin seems to be working for me in controlling the number and severity of hot flashes wadirum also gone through lumpect rads and now on tamoxifen over a year some side effects come and go and not everybody seems to get the same ones from my own experience hot flashes joint pain and vaginal discharge are the most consistent although these sometimes go away for a month or two also had problems with libido and sensation but i believe these are from being perimenopausal because they started before tamoxifen even the hot flashes i had before but worse on tamoxifen maybe you should see which ones you get i take flaxseeds fish oil tumeric for the joint pain green tea 1000 iu vit d because my level was 28 insufficient a multivitamin and tincture of rhubarb for the hot flashes which seems to be working well the tumeric and rhubarb were recommended by my onc and he also oked flaxseed i decided from researching that i needed extra vit d i will tell him on the next visit my gp thought it was a good idea still looking for a solution to the libido sensation problem have been looking into damiana myself as well as other things also looking into topical things for the thinning vaginal tissues so your almond oil vit e sounds interesting would love to continue to compare notes with you so glad that i found this thread i have chemo so i blame my fogginess and fatigue on that but i just thought feel so much better by now i doubt the tamoxifen is helping my mood much either i need to focus on getting back into life finding a decent job and all i want to do is curl up and go to sleep yes this disease turned my life upside down yes it made permanent changes to the physical me now i realize there might be permanent psychological changes i had no idea were a possibility i need the attitude adjustment of the century anyway glad i found this i feel like just making a mountain out of a molehill gramoflexus this is what i was worried about with taxol i have my first one tomorrow not as anxious as i was before my last ac the fear of the unknown always gets me were you able to take anything for the pain i still have a lingering cold so still the chance that i may not get to have chemo tomorrow see oh how i dread the whole process starting over i only had 2 good days this whole time yuck i have too hard a time with nausea on ac so i had been counting myself lucky and giving the emend a lot of credit i wait until the cytoxan in out of my system so i can stop embarassing myself with this ridiculously drippy nose and eyes did you have a reaction at all another thing worried about for tomorrow i think there are a few of us on here that start the second phase tomorrow so good luck to everyone still hoping for a cakewalk but more prepared now thanks for the info misswim so happy you can lay your mind at ease now aftr all the scans pray that taxol doesnt give you bad effects susan and ellequilt all the best for the chair the end is near susan yeah for the last one ellenquilt simply love your creativity and humor you fail to cheer me up jamie so happy for you that chemo is over i have been and am still taking tamoxifen for last 5 years hardly any side effects perhaps only complaint is that on it my weight piles on easily especially around the waist so i have to watch my diet and exercise hi ladies so happy for everyone that has finished their chemo i started taxol last wednesday 1 down 11 to go once a week i have 3 more perjeta and herceptin every 3 weeks for as year the taxol made me feel so weird and the abdominal cramps were pretty bad i think my body likes t h p at all the pa keeps saying this will be so much easier than the a c but i think so right now do see your mo very often i only saw mine for just a few minutes when i was in the hospital in feb i always see the pa at the center before treatme my understanding is adriamycin continues to be used in early stage breast cancer to effect a cure known to be very effective but also a very tough chemo for the patient the one chemo i have tried to avoid because of the harsh side effects i know a limit to how much a patient can have due to cardiac complications i also understand i will completely lose all hair again iunderstand mouth sores can be a real issue i wonder if sucking on ice during the infusion can help what about neuropathy would icing help with that what about the nails i also understand nausea vomiting are real issues with this chemo what about constipation or diarrhea getting over a severe toxic reaction to doxil sister to adriamycin would want to be pain free from the hand foot syndrome before subjecting it to adria i understand it usually cause hand foot syndrome but can ugh had hand foot twice now this last time was horrendous the skin is still peeling and painful been stage iv from day 1 am told the dosing will be less than if i were curable concerned because i do not want to be sick for the holidays why bother to go through this if i enjoy important times so asking for any all experience with this chemo please hold back as i want to be as prepared as i can possibly be todeal with any all side effects that come my way also planning to temporarily stop it before christmas with hopes of feelinggood for the time i will be with family i would like to know how much time i will need before christmas to start feeling good days weeks even if thismeans i only have one infusion before the holidays then so be it more important to me to feel good and enjoy this time with my daughters although scarey being off tx itrust the information you share have found these discussion boards to be more helpful than anything else tried so please bring on your experiences i extend to you a huge thank you in anticipation of your responses this is an interesting exercise and its what everyone has been through here is mine only taxol worked and rads to spine surgery helped i suppose zometa is good so far 2001 5cm dcis surgery a c and rads 2002 recurrence 2cm tumour same place dble mast taxotere lovely time just infections no scans 2005 mets to lungs liver and bones taxotere herceptin xeloda zometa navelbine 2006 rads to spine taxol herceptin zometa caelyx neurosurgery to remove 1 tumour wbrads 2007 lapatinib trial 4 brain tumours srs x 2 progression continues to lungs and liver bones not too bad awaiting next chemo may retry taxol and do gemcitabine but running out of options feel good today but must admit the srs was not something i want to do often first taxol and herceptin done 11 more to go arrived at pm and finally left at pm we were the last there my port is definitely fixed after it not working for my last fec and having to have it the taxol run was ok but i did get a really strong abdominal cramp about way through so they got me a heat pack and stopped the infusion for 10mins apart from that no other effects during the taxol before they ran the t and h they gave me oral kytril and an antihistamine ranitadine zantac then iv dex and iv ranitadine during the herceptin i got quite nauseous so they ran some iv maxalon but i still felt blah all the way home came home ate four pieces of pizza and feel asleep before pm 2am and awake but no ther ses as yet not looking forward to the bone pain hitting and my mo really underplayed them and got no pain relief in preparation from her thanks for being with me in thought jenn ok i have been doing pretty well attitude good hanging out with friends dinner drinks walking etc but in the last couple of days i just feel very well just got done with 15 radiation treatments to lower back today have had 3 small abraxane chemos still have hair which is odd will increase abraxane next week but today i feel like crap nose swollen headache back hurts metallic taste just shitty how am i supposed to do this the rest of my life just feel bad always i just got back from store and broke down crying done that in months i just have this feeling nothing is working and i am feeling like crap for nothing its hard tocomplain to people when they ask me how feeling cause they really have no clue i just say okay or not feeling that hot today how do you guys do this log in to post a reply i have been on tamoxifen since may 04 hot flushes tend to ease then start again night sweats are back at mo with avengence have been on zolpidem sleeping tablets since dx but when sweats are bad even those help me sleep same story go off to sleep then am awake anything from 1am to 5am then am ready to go to sleep but its time to get up for work at the moment completely drained from it have had acupuncture in the past for menopausal symptoms and anxiety and must admit it helped alot but due to costs afford anymore also going to ask my gp for a blood test to check hormones on friday didnt have one last yesr but the year before my results came back as being although i had a hysterectomy nearly 10 years ago i still have my ovaries my gp said bout the last results that if i was trying for ababy it would be a good level not exactly what i wanted to hear post menopausal and highly er i began hormonal treatment with aromasin the joint issues and fatigue were very problematic once the vaginal atrophy set in and incourse became an impossibility there was no way i could make it on this drug for 5 years that spark of spirit so essential to moving on with life after bmx chemo etc was non existent that battle we all go through to reconcile your former essence with the new you after cancer was difficult at best professionally imsurmountable for me on a personal and intimate level my onc male preferred i be on tamoxifen rather than an alafter he gave me the script for estrace between the two i have my new life back though i turned into a sexual response machine duh age 54 nippleless silicone breasts i am quite able to participate and enjoy for those of you who may use estrace i got a wonderful tip from my female gyno instead of using the applicator as directed and losing a good amount of medicine as happens with vaginal creams she said to use a small amount to apply with your fingers inside and out less waste but more importantly less estrogen entering your body we all choose our different routes following this one has been what i needed to move on with my spirit intact checking in on the most informative discussion of all thanks again voracious cdsc a splitdown the middle clearly doingyour research and in the right place to find the resources it can be overwhelming but set yourself on the path ofmaking the best decision for you good thoughts to you as you make your decisions without going back over what i thought i knew and what is posted here i thought chemo was seldom recommended for pure mucinous not because of less aggressiveness but becausechemo has less success with mucinous comparedtoother breast cancers am i way off base here i actually had chemo but that was becausemy pathology came back with her 2 putting things in the ridiculously rare category generally the treatment for her 2 herceptin responds better when given with chemo so howi ended up there finished the harder part of chemo 3 months ago still doing herceptin and have been on tamoxifen for two months even withallergic reactions to chemo i have to say chemo went very well i know sounds crazy butit was so much easier than what my daughter went through 2 years ago for a germ cellcancer in the ovary all about perspective i suppose and each person can react differently to the same chemo but generally noticed those had the protocol i had find it now doing fine on the herceptin and tamoxifen with only really minor side effects it is nice to have my hair growing back i must say and the grand news that same daughter who is healthy and well had a baby girl dec 28 yes they are both miracles and yes miracles happenall the time smile yes jo i found that docetaxol sucks too but there are things you can do about the ses that will definitely help for the constipation that many have stool softener if it turns into diarrhea lomotil rx better than immodium small meals lots and lots of liquids for the first week esp the first 3 days to flush it out of your system for the rash benedryl for each tx i got better at managing the ses so i hope it will help for you take care lani faith i retired and friday was my first day it is wonderful so far surprised going with a cut how does that get you less anesthesia the bloat honestly lasted only a day day and a half it uncomfortable but i was just alarmed when the scale shot up 10 lbs what is your feeling about anesthesia is there some lifetime limit or risk you are worried about the only thing that i can say about the uterus is my mo was questioning why i have my uterus taken out after the fact which was a little bit surprising and why she mention it to me before my gyn mo did not want to take it out and various posters here said the uterus led to some support of the organs while other said they noticed no difference after removal i e incontinence the mo wanted to try me on tamoxifen since i have had ses with exemestane but i excited to add uterine cancer to the cancer worry list we have enough been on exemestane since mid august at first i got hot flashes and a bit of insomnia the hot flashes have gone away but since november been dealing with stiff finger joints and trigger fingers i think it is from swelling and there is so little tolerance for the tendons last night i wore wrist braces and had my first morning without these symptoms i also took a celebrex yesterday so the combo may have helped not a drug i want to take on a regular basis i was honestly getting to the point i needed to switch drugs but when my mo suggested it in november i was determined to keep trying because i only saw similar symptoms here on bco with the other even tamoxifen my hot flashes passed so i thought maybe this hand thing would too not sure it has but doing everything possible including changing my diet to full on 95 less gluten than before 90 of my diet is made up of fruits and greens like kale chard lettuce cabbage the tops of carrots beets anything that counteracts inflammation and cancer btw it takes a vitamix to eat this way imo the other symptom i seem to have is hair thinning but since i went from dyed hair to my natural silver color as it grows out maybe my scalp is just more evident with the color and shortness of my hair atleast i have no bald spots but i am worried about my head of hair told my mo today about my hands peeling and she said i needed to reduce taxotere so she did and she reduced my steroids because of weight gain and gave me lasik for fluidi will let you know if those things help hi just reading and happened to you is happening to me now lumpectom 2011 4 yrs tamoxifen stop working metatistic bc to sturnew collar bone lymp nodes breast went on letrozole june 2015 jan 2016 2 new lumps appeared just getting sorted for 6 more chemo feeling really scared as last chemo may 1st 2015 but i read and i sound you i would be interested in chatting sending love x sanasia was getting worried when i see any post from you for a few days sorry to hear all you went through i take all my meds by mouth before my infusion starts and take the decadron 8mg day x 3 days with emend and then can take compazine zofran and ativan in between luckily have had no from decadron but alot of swelling and bloating so i was going to ask if i could skip it i know how it will affect the nausea though cause i do get the nausea and some vomiting day 1 and 2 after chem due for 3 ac this coming wed i have the purple power port also and found it very uncomfortable for a week after this next treatment is the 1st time be sticking the iv into it does it hurt melinda i got migraine like headaches from the cytoxin so my onc ordered the infusion to be run slower and gave me 600mg ibuprofen prior to starting it still got minor headache but nothing as severe as with 1st ac treatment mean to exclude anyone enjoy reading all your posts newtonville still having a hard time myself having lost all my hair 2 wks ago still feel uncomf in wigs and use scarves home all the time have the courage yet to go out in public with just scarves hats had a chest scan last sat due to a 3mm lung nodule on 1st chest scan in may which i was really nervous about but i was thrilled that it is exactly the same and no change so that was a huge relief my onc said many people have isolated small nodules that are nothing but when you have bc all this matter anymore and we start to thingk the worst well good night all and stay strong hello ladies i posted since the early part of this thread i have been reading it all along as i could but one of the reasons i activewas because with each successive ac treatment i was feeling worse and worse and any reminder of chemo just made me nauseated all over i was onthree types medication and only got sick twice but my recovery time was getting longer and longer my treatment entails 4 tx of ac and then 4dd txs of taxol i have just finished my third tx of taxol yesterday and have found itentirely more tolerable i get body aches about 48 hours after treatment and they last about 2 days i have had taxol with and without the neulasta shot and the shot definitely makesmybody aches more intense but it is so nice having a good stomach and no splitting headaches i can usually control the body aches with xtrastrength tylenol the steriods benedrylthey give me as part of the taxol usually keep me from getting much sleep the first 24 hours after treatment but i have learned to adjust my schedule around it i only have onetaxol tx left and then will start 6 weeks of rads i am trying to get on the treadmill for minutes times a week and i think that isdefinitely helping my energy stamina i am just now starting to feel optimistic that there is an end in sight this is certainly an emotional journey as much as it is physical linda hello hope below article will help you while you are waiting for your results stay strong stay positive be proactive all the best as you begin your journey cancer auckl 2014 125133 published online 2014 oct 8 doi bcbcr s9454 pmcid pmc 4197909 murtuza m

cancer a substantial number recur due to persistent disease systemic adjuvant chemotherapy improves outcomes and has advanced from regimens to modern combinations although chemotherapy is the cornerstone of adjuvant therapy new biomarkers are identifying patients who can forego such treatment therapy is a promising platform for drug development but investigators should recognize the limitations of surrogate endpoints and clinical trials previous decades have focused on discovering developing and intensifying adjuvant chemotherapy future efforts should focus on customizing therapy and reducing chemotherapy for patients unlikely to benefit in some cases it may be possible to replace chemotherapy with treatments directed at specific genetic or molecular breast cancer subtypes yet we anticipate that chemotherapy will remain a critical component of adjuvant therapy for years to come keywords neoadjuvant toxicity pathologic response metastasesbreast cancer is a common malignancy in women and causes over a deaths each year worldwide 1 in the united states women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014 and will succumb 2although 90 of women are diagnosed with early breast cancer prospective studies have shown breast cancerspecific mortality rates exceeding 50 at 30 year in women treated with surgery alone 3 although local therapies can eradicate disease in the breast and axilla early systemic dissemination of microscopic disease often precedes local therapy hence the rationale for medical therapies after surgical resection is to eliminate or perhaps suppress this microscopic disease 4 postoperative medical therapy saves lives by reducing the likelihood of incurable recurrence of breast cancer however it is difficult to identify the patients who have no disease and so these patients are often exposed to chemotherapy even though they would be cured with surgery alone etymologically adjuvant is derived from latin adiuvare to aid adjuvant therapy aids surgery in effecting cure of breast cancer adjuvant treatments for breast cancer can include chemotherapy hormonal therapy human epidermal growth factor receptor her 2 directed therapies and radiation of these radiation can eradicate microscopic disease in the breast chest wall skin and nearby lymph node basins whereas systemic medications can also destroy microscopic disease distant from the breast significant improvements in efficacy and tolerability in adjuvant therapy have been achieved in the last 50 years here we discuss these improvements customization for specific breast cancer subtypes address recent controversies and provide our vision for how chemotherapy will be used in the future adjuvant chemotherapy was spawned by poor outcomes after maximal surgical and radiotherapy interventions the idea of using chemotherapy as an adjuvant to surgery was supported by the discovery of hematogenous cancer cells and by encouraging animal studies suggesting that these could be eliminated with chemotherapy early trials showed promising outcomes in patients who received chemotherapy one of the first trials was a randomized study of nitrogen mustard given at the time of mastectomy and at 4 8 and 12 month intervals with 13 years of among the 37 controls there were 12 recurrences and 7 deaths whereas there were only 5 recurrences and 1 death in the 37 treated patients these promising preliminary data supported larger studies one early adjuvant chemotherapy trial in breast cancer was the national surgical adjuvant breast and bowel project nsabp b 01 study wherein a short course of thiotepa n n given as adjuvant therapy after a radical mastectomy reduced the risk of recurrence and improved overall survival os in premenopausal women with four or more positive nodes 5 similarly the nsabp b 05 trial demonstrated improved survival dfs with adjuvant melphalan in early breast cancer 6 given the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy for curing lymphomas there was an intense interest in applying this strategy to breast cancer leading to the development of cyclophosphamide methotrexate and 5 fluorouracil cmf 7 the milan group evaluated 12 cycles of adjuvant cmf and discovered that this improves dfs and os subsequently 6 months of adjuvant cmf was found to be equivalent to 12 months 8 these studies established 6 month cmf as a standard adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer by the 1980s by the 1970s doxorubicin had also emerged as a promising new drug derived from a mutant soil bacterium 9 this drug now familiar to many breast cancer and lymphoma survivors due to its red color was initially named after the adriatic sea and retains the abbreviation a for adriamycin in breast cancer regimens again the milan group pioneered development and ultimately demonstrated its benefit in metastatic and then adjuvant treatment of breast cancer nsabp b 15 compared cmf against doxorubicin combined with cyclophosphamide ac revealing that outcomes were equivalent 12 however ac was better tolerated and completed in 3 months rather than 6 months for cmf these trials established ac as the dominant adjuvant regimen for early breast cancer in north america similarly other groups developed regimens such as fac doxorubicin cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil and fec epirubicin cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil 1315in the early 1990s paclitaxel taxol was identified as a highly effective therapy for metastatic breast cancer 16 the nsabp b 28 trial evaluated the addition of paclitaxel sequentially after ac chemotherapy and showed that this improved dfs in early breast cancer with a trend toward improved os 17 similarly the national cancer institute intergroup study showed improved dfs and os with the addition of four cycles of paclitaxel every 3 weeks after the completion of adjuvant ac 18 docetaxel also improved dfs and os in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide tac in and early breast cancer subsequently weekly administration of paclitaxel was found to have superior dfs and os to administration every 3 weeks 2123one limitation of prior regimens was the rare but serious risk of permanent heart failure from doxorubicin to obviate this the us oncology 9735 trial compared four cycles of adjuvant docetaxel and cyclophosphamide tc with standard ac to evaluate efficacy of a safe adjuvant regimen this study revealed that four cycles of tc is superior to ac in both dfs and os 24 elderly women 65 years constituted 16 of the study population and 90 of women had or one to three early breast cancer based on these data tc is considered a standard regimen for adjuvant therapy for or breast cancer 25 for breast cancer good evidence suggests that four cycles of tc is inferior to sequential even when concurrent anthracycline is added to tc although has superior breast cancerspecific outcomes using anthracyclines incurs risk for cardiac toxicity and rare secondary blood dyscrasias nsabp 49 is testing if six cycles of tc is as effective as in reducing breast cancer recurrence without the risks 28although adjuvant chemotherapy reduces the risk of recurrence and improves odds of cure it does carry risks of side effects some of which can be severe and persistent during chemotherapy two thirds of patients experience severe fatigue 29 in early studies with adjuvant chemotherapy a significant number of women 70 had nausea and vomiting however with the advent of effective antiemetic medications this has greatly reduced alopecia is nearly universal with or tc chemotherapy a reduction in the white cell count occurs after each cycle of chemotherapy though this persists only for a few days and hospitalization for neutropenic fever is uncommon 10 30 for regimens with rates of neutropenic fever exceeding 20 granulocyte factor is available to accelerate recovery from neutropenia and prevent neutropenic fever 31 common side effects seen with adjuvant taxanes include neuropathy 15 20 myalgia and arthralgia 10 15 immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur during paclitaxel infusion and occasionally are life threatening these may present as flushing urticaria fever bronchospasm and serum sickness 17 pretreatment steroids and antihistamines reduce but do not eliminate this risk one of the principal concerns with adjuvant chemotherapy is the risk of cardiotoxicity in the adjuvant setting where the total dose of doxorubicin is typically limited to less than 300 mg m2 the incidence of clinically significant cardiomyopathy is less than 1 29 however the incidence rises with escalating cumulative dose and presence of other cardiac risk factors 32 another concern attributed in part to anthracyclines is the potential risk of secondary myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myelogenous leukemia aml a combined analysis of six adjuvant studies conducted by the nsabp using ac chemotherapy reported a 5 year incidence of aml ranging from to 33 unlike the leukemia associated with alkylating agents that associated with anthracyclines is more likely to be monocytic to involve a specific cytogenetic abnormality 11q23 and to develop within a few years after treatment 34the risks of chemotherapy are serious but can be managed by physicians with expertise in these medications prior to initiating adjuvant chemotherapy the physician must determine that the risks outweigh the benefits of chemotherapy given the risk of permanent toxicity or death due to chemotherapy in a small fraction of patients it is typically deemed worthwhile if there is at least a 5 decrease in risk in cancer recurrence or death as demonstrated by strong clinical evidence while early efforts focused on adding chemotherapy agents to improve patient outcomes recent efforts have focused on the intensification of effective agents dose intensity is a measure of chemotherapy drug delivered per unit time 35 however escalation of drug dosage proved unsuccessful at improving cancer outcomes additionally increasing the number of chemotherapy cycles of ac or paclitaxel failed to improve clinical outcomes 38in contrast to the failure of dose intensification dose density refers to more frequent administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy this approach is based on the observation that human cancers grow by nonexponential gompertzian kinetics with the regrowth of cancer cells between cycles of chemotherapy being more rapid than in exponential models the calgb 9741 study evaluated this concept comparing every 2 weeks versus conventional every 3 weeks as well as sequential versus concurrent combination chemotherapy treatment significantly improved dfs and os and there was no difference between the sequential and concurrent approaches 39 subsequent has confirmed the benefit of increasing dose density 40the approach has also been used with therapy our group recently demonstrated that docetaxel and cyclophosphamide tc on a schedule is safe in this study patients received adjuvant tc every 2 weeks with pegfilgrastim support for four cycles 90 completed therapy within 10 weeks with 83 completing in 8 weeks without dose modification the rate of neutropenic fever was low neuropathy was similar to previous reports and rash and erythrodythesia were common thus our study showed that tc has tolerability profiles similar to standard tc has low risk of neutropenic fever and is expected to be equally effective to or more effective than standard tc 41 among the standard chemotherapy regimens tc is completed in 8 weeks making it the most expeditious standard regimen available today fig 1 duration of different adjuvant chemotherapeutic regimens the value of adjuvant chemotherapy depends on a balance of absolute benefit and risk physicians estimate the likelihood of distant dissemination based on the stage and subtype of breast cancer and then estimate the probability that chemotherapy will prevent recurrence several tools are available to assist with risk stratification and assessing magnitude of benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy adjuvant online is an prediction program which takes into account tumor size lymph nodes grade estrogen receptor er status and patient factors including age and 42 the drawback of this model is that it does not take into account her 2 status 43 also predictions can be strongly affected by tumor grade which has high variability a similar model used for risk assessment and decision making is the predict model which accounts for her 2 status and ki 67 proliferation markers 46 these tools can assist with shared informed decision making about the risks and benefits of chemotherapy customized to each patient chemotherapy is the mainstay of adjuvant treatment for patients with disease we consider adjuvant chemotherapy for tumors cm or axillary lymph node involvement for disease typically we would recommend 39 however tc is a reasonable adjuvant therapy choice for or breast cancer platinum agents such as cisplatin and carboplatin are agents with activity in breast cancer particularly in the subgroup the majority of brca 1 associated breast cancers are and are sensitive to agents because of impaired repair by homologous recombination of breaks dsb induced by platinums agents have shown efficacy and are a preferred regimen in the metastatic setting with breast cancer 4951the geparsixto trial assessed the benefit of adding carboplatin to chemotherapy in and her 2 early breast cancer and found a significant improvement in pathological complete response pcr 52 however a major criticism is that the anthracycline backbone was nonstandard with weekly doxorubicin and paclitaxel combined with bevacizumab it is possible that carboplatin is superfluous when compared with conventionally dosed therapy similar data supporting the use of platinums were reported from calgb 40603 a randomized phase ii trial this showed significantly improved pcr rates by the addition of carboplatin to chemotherapy in early breast cancer 53 side effects with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were significantly increased with carboplatin interestingly similar effects were seen with bevacizumab even though it is not found to be effective in the adjuvant setting although these data are promising we believe more conclusive data will be required before routine use of platinum agents to adjuvant therapy for breast cancer moreover it will be important to learn whether any benefit of platinum therapy is restricted to patients with impaired dsb as occurs eg by loss of brca function if so this escalation of therapy could be targeted specifically to individuals likely to benefit trastuzumab is a recombinant monoclonal antibody to her 2 and was the first agent developed for her 2 early breast cancer several large clinical trials showed a significant improvement in dfs and os with the addition of 1 year of trastuzumab h to adjuvant chemotherapy 5457 subsequently the breast cancer international research group identified a regimen with docetaxel and carboplatin combined with trastuzumab tch which had similar efficacy but lower risk of cardiotoxicity 58 although the tch regimen appeared to have a lower risk of side effects this regimen is associated with high rates of acute toxicities particularly myelosuppression 59 it is important to note that the comparator anthracycline arm in this trial differed from preferred regimens with substitution of docetaxel for paclitaxel based on these studies tch and sequential anthracyclinetrastuzumab are standard adjuvant therapy options in this population adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended even for small her 2 breast cancer but the threshold for treatment is disputed for disease and cancers 1 cm chemotherapy and trastuzumab is generally recommended in disease for tumors cm in size we and many others do not routinely recommend adjuvant chemotherapy or trastuzumab the reason is that although patients with small tumors were included in early adjuvant trastuzumab studies more recent cohort studies have shown excellent outcomes in this population with a 5 year dfs of 95 without any adjuvant therapies 60 for tumors 0 cm adjuvant chemotherapy with her 2 targeted therapies can be considered based on age and oncologists today vary in their practice for treating small her 2 breast cancer 59 paclitaxel with trastuzumab is well tolerated and may become a future standard for small her 2 positive cancers 61the threshold for recommending chemotherapy in hormone receptorpositive her 2 negative early breast cancer is difficult to define because low and patients have distinct benefits from receiving chemotherapy 62 for disease we recommend standard chemotherapy typically we would recommend 39 however tc or tc is also a reasonable adjuvant therapy choice for breast cancer the south west oncology group swog rxponder trial s1007 will determine whether chemotherapy can be safely omitted for certain women with one to three positive axillary lymph nodes in disease our chemotherapy recommendations are primarily guided by tumor size patient age and typically adjuvant chemotherapy is not recommended for tumors 1 cm prospective cohort studies have shown an excellent outcome for these patients with 5 year dfs between 93 and 98 without chemotherapy 63 for tumors 1 cm multigene tumor assays can provide both prognostic and predictive information although assays of the primary tumor cannot directly determine whether cancer cells have or have not disseminated they can identify tumors with higher or lower propensity for such dissemination one widely used assay is the 21 gene recurrence score oncotype dx which predicts chemotherapy benefit in er breast cancer with high and low recurrence scores further information on managing patients with intermediate scores based on the trial assigning individualized options for treatment study is anticipated 66 until then we recommend tc for high scores and discuss risks benefits of chemotherapy for intermediate scores additionally preliminary evidence using oncotype dx in breast cancer is promising 67 other assays include the 70 gene mammaprint profile and 50 gene pam 50 assay which classifies tumors into luminal a luminal b her 2 enriched and subtypes these assays may aid in decision making for other patient populations including those with hormone receptornegative disease the cyclin kinases 4 and 6 cdk retinoblastoma pathway governs the cell cycle restriction point this pathway is frequently altered in breast cancer and is a potentially relevant target for anticancer therapy palbociclib pd 0332991 is a potent and selective inhibitor of cdk 4 and cdk 6 and the most widely studied agent in this field 72 in the recently reported paloma 1 study combination of palbociclib plus letrozole doubled survival pfs in patients with metastatic her 2 negative breast cancer 73 trials assessing the benefit of adding adjuvant palbociclib to endocrine therapy for hormone receptorpositive breast cancer are ongoing the mammalian target of rapamycin mtor pathway is often activated in breast cancer and may be an important mechanism of resistance to hormonal therapies mtor can be inactivated with inhibitors like everolimus the bolero 2 study showed a significant improvement in pfs with the addition of everolimus to exemestane in advanced postmenopausal hormone receptorpositive breast cancer lending credence to the importance and feasibility of targeting this pathway 74 currently the swog s 1207 study is enrolling to assess the efficacy of 1 year of adjuvant everolimus in hormone receptorpositive and her 2 negative early breast cancer in the setting the combination of everolimus with letrozole in early hormone receptorpositive breast cancer showed a significant improvement in clinical response by palpation and ultrasound in small clinical studies 75 although this may be a useful adjunct to standard hormonal therapy the cdk inhibitors appear to have stronger effects in metastatic disease thus we anticipate that mtor inhibitors will ultimately be superseded by cdk inhibitors poly polymerase parp enzymes especially parp 1 are critical for appropriate recognition and repair of dna breaks in cells lacking functional brca 1 or brca in tumors with brca 1 or brca 2 mutations inhibition of parp 1 further compromises dna repair leading to cell death thus making parp inhibitors an attractive therapeutic for and breast tumors 77 in the ispy 2 study a master protocol toward evaluating a variety of targeted agents in the setting addition of a parp inhibitor and carboplatin to standard chemotherapy produced an impressive pcr rate of 52 in the signature 78 this combination of a platinum and a parp inhibitor has now been graduated to the phase iii setting however the strongest preclinical and clinical evidence supports the use of parp inhibitors in the setting of brca mutations therefore we anticipate that these agents will be most useful in this subset of patients several ongoing studies are assessing the efficacy of new her 2 targeted agents in adjuvant therapy pertuzumab is a second her 2 targeted monoclonal antibody directed at the dimerization domain pertuzumab improves pfs markedly when added to trastuzumab plus docetaxel in the treatment of her 2 metastatic breast cancer 79 in the setting the addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab and taxane significantly improved pcr rates and this led to the approval of pertuzumab as a new standard for chemotherapy although neoadjuvant pertuzumab was tested in combination with fec and tch 81 we often use and add pertuzumab every 3 weeks concurrent with weekly paclitaxel and trastuzumab one ongoing controversy concerns whether pertuzumab should also be used in postoperative adjuvant therapy of breast cancer the us food and drug administration fda approved pertuzumab for but not adjuvant therapy of her 2 breast cancer based on the endpoint of pcr yet if pcr is a valid surrogate for survival then pertuzumab should also be used in the postoperative adjuvant setting since pcr predicts that this drug helps eliminate distant for this reason we often use four doses of pertuzumab every 3 weeks concurrent with paclitaxeltrastuzumab in both the and adjuvant settings another newer her 2 targeted agent is trastuzumab emtansine 1 an antibodydrug conjugate incorporating trastuzumab with cytotoxic activity of the agent dm1 and this has shown excellent activity with significant improvement in pfs and os in metastatic breast cancer 82given the new her 2 targeted therapies it is time to consider eliminating some of the multiple cytotoxic agents for treatment of her 2 breast cancer the future paradigm of chemotherapy regimens should focus on chemotherapy and minimizing side effects without sacrificing efficacy this is reinforced by the results of dual her 2 blockade by trastuzumab and pertuzumab showing 16 of patients have pcr from her 2 directed therapy alone without chemotherapy 80 future trials for this type of cancer should strongly consider using these her 2 targeted therapies either as monotherapy or using a chemotherapy backbone on which to further develop targeted agents fig 2 of development of adjuvant therapies in early breast cancer promising agents in the near future red chemotherapeutic agents blue targeted agents chemotherapy has been a mainstay of adjuvant therapy of breast cancer for over four decades however with the advent of improved targeted therapies it is appealing to imagine a future where chemotherapy is eliminated entirely however it may be difficult to realize this vision with targeted agents targeted drugs are often cytostatic rather than cytotoxic suggesting they will forestall tumor growth rather than eliminate even so there is hope for significant advancement in reducing needless exposure to adjuvant therapy 2 it is in principle possible to identify disease future advances in imaging or biomarker technology could improve staging to identify the patients who are most in need of adjuvant therapy 3 biomarkers of chemotherapy can be developed to better predict whether specific chemotherapies work for a specific cancer type chemotherapies were largely developed prior to the discovery of therapies although it is recognized that some tumors do do not respond to specific drugs and that some reasons have been proposed it is not yet predictable discovery of biomarkers for cancer therapy might have a profound effect on customizing tailored chemotherapy regimens to each patient for example we and others have identified mechanisms for how paclitaxel elicits its anticancer effects 8385 additionally some drugs such as methotrexate can have profoundly different effects on cancer cells with distinct genetic backgrounds suggesting that a biomarker for drug sensitivity can be discovered 86there are significant practical difficulties with eliminating or reducing chemotherapy in principle oncologists would demand evidence of noninferiority for standard therapy such trials would be large and would not offer patients better treatments or better outcomes when so many promising new therapies are available such studies may not be a good use of limited resources for clinical trials instead we would support developing innovative adjuvant studies that would directly replace some components of chemotherapy with new agents this would move the field forward and obviate the requirement for exhaustive and large noninferiority studies that would sap limited patient and financial resources for clinical trials for inoperable or inflammatory locally advanced cancers chemotherapy prior to surgery is the standard of care is there an advantage of therapy in tumors that are operable at diagnosis this question was addressed by the nsabp b 18 and b 27 clinical trials in which preoperative ie chemotherapy was compared with adjuvant chemotherapy 87 in nsabp b 18 there was no survival benefit of receiving ac in the setting although a subset analysis did suggest improved outcomes with chemotherapy for women younger than 50 years 87 nsabp b 27 compared three regimens 1 preoperative ac 2 preoperative ac followed by preoperative docetaxel and 3 preoperative ac followed by postoperative docetaxel there was a significant increase in pcr noted with the addition of preoperative docetaxel but there was no significant difference in dfs or os 87 thus and adjuvant chemotherapy are considered equivalent in terms of survival benefit for operable tumors however therapy offers several other advantages over standard postoperative adjuvant treatment in breast cancer principally therapy provides an opportunity for bulky disease to make surgery more likely for research and prognosis the approach also offers response assessment to treatment several studies have shown a correspondence between dfs and os with both clinical and pathologic tumor response to therapies in and her 2 disease 88 on the other hand pcr seems to be a poor marker of survival in hormone receptorpositive breast cancer thus pcr is proposed as a surrogate marker for disease outcomes in and her 2 breast cancer the benefit of this marker is more rapid development of effective therapies since pcr can be assessed immediately after chemotherapy and surgery are complete yet pcr has limitations as a surrogate even when pathologic complete response is achieved some patients ultimately have disease progression in the nsabp b 18 and b 27 trials 25 and 18 developed recurrence despite pcr this could reflect limitations on assessing complete response by pathologic sampling and analysis eg some complete responses may have had undetected residual disease it is also possible that the primary tumor does not respond the same way as distant indeed some scientists have proposed that disseminated cells have unique properties that behave different from the bulk primary tumor 91historically new drugs in breast cancer have been approved first in the metastatic setting followed by large and long adjuvant clinical trials and subsequent approval in the adjuvant setting coming several years later the time from initiation of a phase iii trial of a drug in metastatic breast cancer to approval for its use in an adjuvant population often exceeds a decade 92over the last few years approaches have been proposed as a platform for rapid drug development yet there is considerable debate in the breast cancer scientific community regarding the appropriateness of using pcr as an accelerated pathway for drug approval a large performed and funded by the fda included 12 large international trials comprising patients the results show that pcr is associated with dfs and os and that the best association is achieved when complete response is defined as eradication of tumor from both breast and lymph nodes the association between pcr and outcomes was strongest in patients with breast cancer and in those with her 2 hormone receptornegative tumors who received trastuzumab however in the analysis improvement in pcr corresponded poorly with improved dfs r2 and os r2 88recent discrepancies between and adjuvant studies have further challenged the utility of pcr as a surrogate endpoint for example lapatinib improved pcr in the neoallto trial yet showed no improvement in dfs when added to adjuvant therapy in allto 93 in our view such discordant findings are not surprising 2 pcr is an imperfect surrogate trials have demonstrated evidence of disease recurrence in 18 25 of patients after pcr compared with 35 42 in those without pcr this would suggest that pcr is only partly predictive of outcomes ultimately the limitations of pcr and clinical trial designs should be acknowledged in our view pcr is a valid but imperfect surrogate endpoint we believe that it is appropriate to provisionally modify established neo adjuvant therapy based on this surrogate endpoint when effect size is clinically significant eg 10 increase in pcr however this provisional alteration should be validated by a clinical trial in the adjuvant setting over the past half century adjuvant chemotherapy has been established as standard for breast cancer treatment and has saved many lives the current standard of care is sequential anthracycline plus taxane for breast cancers and four cycles of tc or no chemotherapy for lower risk breast cancers in the future we will increasingly customize regimens using genetic profiling and targeted therapies to personalize care for patients this will include defining the subset of patients who can avoid chemotherapy particularly for er and her 2 disease for patients novel and more effective targeted therapies will be added as investigators move with excitement toward developing new agents there remains a pressing need for better biomarkers to predict benefit of chemotherapy although clinical trials are promising as a rapid platform for clinical investigation researchers and oncologists need a renewed appreciation of the limitations of surrogate endpoints and fully appreciate the influences of chance and bias in small studies moreover it is possible that response in metastatic disease will be a superior surrogate to pcr we anticipate a future in which chemotherapy is customized to the needs and risks of each patient with continued improvements in morbidity and mortality from breast cancer we thank k wisinski and a tevaarwerk for discussions of adjuvant therapy

click below link best bobbi i am the opposite everyone said my hair would thin gradually on abraxane not it fell out by the gobs on about day 10 enjoy your inch while you have it hello everyone so sorry i have been quiet lately i needed to step away from the boards for awhile because i was having some really anxious moments after all my treatments ended and just needed a little break i hope you all understand that may sound a little odd but the real anxiety for me started things wrapped up and i was left to think what next all the time the worries about recurrences set in quickly but i think i have it mostly under control now i started arimidex the other day after healing up from an oophorectomy bad hot flashes since starting it but nothing else seems tolerable so far i also wanted to pop back in to bring a website to attention has been significant research with very promising findings on the use of d3 in preventing and treating many forms of cancer along with other diseases such as ms an impressive scientific panel guiding the public information including the ceo of a comprehensive cancer research hospital in my area of western new york please consider taking a look at the website hugs and warmest wishes to all especially those still in treatment my thoughts are with everyone every day even if i am not showing up on the board too often nadine hello everyone i am new to this board and seeking advise i am currently on my fourth round of tch chemo i have two more to endure i do receive herceptin weekly as well it has been the worst experience of my life i waspreparedfor the nausea and fatigue but i have gotten every side effect possible and then some the worst part is what i can only descibe as severe anxiety attacks that start about two or three days after my chemo i get full body shakes rapid heart rate light headed tingling and numbmess severe weakness and horrible nightmares thatmake me wake up screaming this lasts for days andleaves me completely drained i am wondering if it is caused by the three day course of steroidsthat i takefor my treatment day not to mention the added steroid that i receive in the iv i would appreciate if anyone else has heard of this happening and what to do about it hi all tamox can screw up your period but does not cause actual menopause like chemo can if you are in menopause from chemo tamox will improve those symptoms because it acts like estrogen in the body i recommend all women get their hormone levels checked regularly including a reading on their ovarian reserve so you know what is a side effect of tamoxifen there are so very many or what is menopause from chemo chemo reduces our ovarian reserve the number of eggs we have left and impacts the quality of the eggs that are left in some cases we stop ovulating completely total menopause because chemo has destroyed all the eggs we had left when we started chemo tamox causes ses that are similar to ses of being in menopause but important to know not menopause just ses of the drug been on it for two years and get a period every 28 days but it may only last one day my ovaries are super cystic and i was on lupron for 2 years so will go in on monday to see the obgyn about the ovary issues since tamox acts like estrogen in the body it may be causing the cysts hope that helps i run a fertility org for bc patients so feel free to email me privately if you all have more questions xo ladies hope everyone had a good night i am sad today that my son has to go home to fla tomorrow have really enjoyed seeing him on the sofa next to me hate that i felt so bad i leave the house yet twisted the arms of dh ds to have dinner out with dd family grand kids 4 5 on friday we r all going to her house this afternoon have dinner later i may hang out on her sofa while they swim in neighborhood pool or if i can manage the heat go down watch for a while this taxotere has been hard on taking oxycodone at night so i can sleep bone pain especially knees shins is really bad know it my osteoarthritis made the pain strike there or not but felt like i had to force my brain to tell the legs how to walk for a couple of days weird trying to force the looming thyroid issue to back of on getting rid of for a weekend trip to chicago next weekend going with grand kids their mom dad for a big city adventure squeezing in fun times between chemo is a needed goal you agree enjoy the rest of your weekend everyone blessedteacher we are in the same boat tamoxifen failed me so i am on anastrazole but i am also so also on zoledex for ovary suppression fun fun i have bad hot flashes i ache some at the end of the night but its improved since i increased my exercise the most annoying se is i have developed trigger thumb but i always say highly motivated to take the drugs since a recurrence everyone talking about osteopenia and osteoporosis how often do we get a dexa scan my great grandma and grandmother and mother all have had osteoporosis so kind of expecting to head in that direction regardless of meds and especially with meds karebear 76 i will give you a little rundown on how i have been handling the steroid rollercoaster tues taxol then i eat everything in sight feel ok actually sleep okwed still on the eating train still feeling ok sleeping ok ativan ativan ativan thurs the feeding frenzy stops by thurs night i can feel myself start coming down from the steroidsfri totally completely useless can barely do anything just no energy whatsoeversat start feeling a little better but an emotional feeling better not sleeping still kinda emotional but the eating thing is back to normaltues start all over again all in all though i like taxol better i am on 8 weekly my onc divided my dose dense schedule into weekly doses i have had no nausea thank god and i had to take any meds beside the painkiller once in a while i have ovarian suppression shots they give me killer headaches my nail beds have started turning black so i keep polish on them constantly which is kinda fun change it up weekly i think i am getting a damn yeast infection down below though gotta talk to doc about that i think cause i have been trying to keep up my normal sex life uh not really working the way i planned and i have been having a beer or two the nights i feel s the other good thing when i feel well beer actually tastes good and i never liked it before and it relaxes me a little which is nice i feel more on taxol like i can go out and socialize more i have started having tinglies in my hands and feet but they go away as quick as they come on for now i still have 6 more treatments to go so we will see hope this helps remember everyone is different and everyone reacts differently hugs happy day angel i was diagnosed with stage iib in january 2012 at the age of 30 i actually had found the lump in august 2011 but waited until december for a mammogram because of my low risk profile and the canadian system because of this i look at every august as a bit of a milestone also doing very well tamoxifen and zoladex are not too bad i still get fatigued at times and my reconstructed and raidated breast and arm are tight as hell despite being very active and doing physio oh well at least alive last thing is the hope to take a break from tamoxifen in the next year to have a baby fingers crossed best wishes to all of you amazon i like your wig as is too i get what your dh is saying though i think my family likes mine so much just because it looks like the old me only better i know when my port is getting removed like it out the day of my last chemo paulette so sorry about your foot virginia woo hoo done re sleep melatonin do squat for me sorry to say i wish i could ship the costco bottle to someone who could use them i take a prescription medicine called mirtazapine i know mentioned it before but an when taken in a standard dose a sleep aid when taken in a low dose works like a charm for me i meet my ro the same day as my last appointments i believe so close to the next phase of all this speaking of phases i must be the only person having a harder time with taxol than with ac i feel like crap crap crap i think i just got off easy with ac but i still feel like crap my body aches my finger tips throb and my fingernails on my thumbs and pointers are starting to look a little funky i hate it when this happens during the weekend because even though i try my best to be cheery my crapiness seems to cast a pall over the whole house i know the rest of the country is miserably cold but stunningly beautiful and warm in ca and i still just want to stay under a blanket and stare mindlessly at hgtv re dry peeling hands not sure it can be prevented but it can get worse with lots of hand washing especially in hot water aquaphor helps but so goopy at night i put aquaphor on then daily moisturizer something in the aveeno that creates a seal so you feel so goopy sticky it seems to last through a few hand washings for me too re low blood pressure mine was always low before all this and now it can get really low mo said to get up more slowly and increase salt intake i hate adding salt it makes me get bloaty quirky so glad okay to the couch i hope everyone has a nice day i originally posted this on the arimidex thread also posting here at the suggestion of dunesleeper been on the sight for quite some time been on anastrozole since diagnosis 13 my initial reaction was great 8 cm tumor in left breast shrunk to 1cm pet scan in july 2014 showed noactive cancer in my spine sternum or breast pet scan december 2014 showed a new bone met l4 hot flashes were bad at first subsided somewhat bone pain increased i know if from anastrozole xgeva or mets also any sight that previously had arthritis is quite painful cervical spine c3 4 lumbar spine l4 5 l4 now has a tumor right knee is swelling and pain in previous osteoarthritis sights a se of anastrozole or should i be asking these questions on the this bone mets thread i went to see a friend in florida for a few days been experiencing swelling in right knee by the time the plane landed i could barely move my leg by saturday i was in the er to make certain it a blood clot turns out i have a cyst and knee effusion fluid and swelling i went to ortho today monday he says in addition to a bakers cyst and the swelling i appear to have a meniscus tear how i got this no clue had one years ago and it was corrected arthroscopocally ortho tells me a second occurance is unusual heck my whole life is unusual lately he has pancreatic cancer so he somewhat understands my hesitancy to have yes another test mri or surgery said pain might subside on own if i rest it for months anyone had anything similar do previous osteo arthritis sights give you more pain since bone mets i se my mo at the end of the month anything i should ask him specifically thanks as always for the help ladies sharon annie so glad you finished your ac i know having struggled with some of the same fears how hard that must have been for you and so glad you have it behind you i had all my chemo together but from what heard the taxane drugs cause nausea so you should be much better i got a tiny bit of neuropathy in my left hand that i attribute from the taxotere but it seems to be a little better and i can still button shirts type fast and put earrings in so it very bad inmate please fear eribulin that what i had for 12 doses 6 cycles right after i finished rads it bad at all my counts dipped down the second week but were always back up after the week off i never had neulasta or neupogen during it i worked throughout usually taking just a couple days off after each infusion it was nothing compared to the primary chemo i was slightly anemic and tired and got pale but i also kept my head hair but my eyebrows are just now looking somewhat normal i did have bone and muscle aches and depended on painkillers some for that mainly because i had to work long hours not everyone gets the muscle aches they gave me anti nausea stuff but i toyed with the idea of avoiding it because i really think i needed it i also cut the steroids down to about half the dose they gave me initially because i get wired from prednisone i had my last taxol in early june then carboplatin once a week until august 1 my neuropathy started around the second dose dense taxol in early may my neuropathy persists not pain but numbness mostly in my feet but also in my thumbs and two other fingers i saw some initial improvement after stopping taxol but then it regressed the 2nd week of carboplatin though to worst state i have not seen improvment since it is not painful but i can only walk for about an hour before it becomes too unbearable i take glutamine carnitine and a b vitamin they do seem to help gabapentin just made my feet more numb which is exactly the opposite of what i want is there still hope for recovery this far out from treatment and given i have seen no improvement since 2 weeks post taxol back in june my mo says for up to a year but i see some continual improvment if that were the case my first thought like gemini was gi virus due to the delay in onset congratulations to her on the recent weight loss very impressive on the other hand reflux can also be involved as corky mentions perhaps an antacid such as tums could take the edge off i was fine when i was on tamoxifen usually a side effect like nausea diminishes as one becomes accustomed to the medication which fortunately happened with amoc sometimes changing time of day try a bedtime dose then hopefully be asleep during the worst of the queasiness or taking the drug with food can make it more tolerable for sure call your clinic if still bothering you let us know what they suggest i had my second doxil last friday and feeling exhausted again the same thing happened last month other than that some muscle pain but i can handle it my onc put me on prilosec a while back since i use advil for pain relief so i had the indigestion problems that seem to be pretty common i keep waiting for the other shoe to drop but so far so good i am curious though about hair loss i can see that mine is thinning a bit but wonder how others are doing i dread going back to the wig routine i had with taxotere but i hate wearing hats and just not brave enough to go topless are the rest of you keeping or losing your hair joanie hi ladies i have been reading the posts and finally decided to join you i was diagnosed in jan 08 at age 35 had lumpectomy and snb then mastectomy with expander in feb 08 chemo may aug 08 exchange sep 08 and started tamoxifen the day after my exchange surgery i started walkingabout 1 mile in october andincreased it to 1 hour miles or so overa month and joined the gymat the end of last year now i walk 1 hour during lunch miles 2 sets of 30 minelleptical and 30 min of weight liftinga day takea day off from time to time but work out on most days i have more energy and i feel great now here is my problem i weigh almost 10 pounds more now than i started inoctober even though i have not gained all the weight i lost during chemo my drs are not concerned with my weight gain because i am in healthy weight range they tell me i am thin but in my native country i am far from thin my weight used to go up and down 6 pounds over weekend until just several weeks agobut finally started to move within pound range i talked with a registered dietitian and she did not see any problem with my diet since i was already eating whole grain lots of fruits and vegetables and little meat i want to blame and tamoxifen for my weight issues but maybe i amnot doing something right what am i doing wrong thanks annie i take zofran each morning first thing on a m t stomach then i have a small breakfast and take my oral cytoxan i like rita really only had a small bout of nausea two days after infusion day the zofran worked great all the rest of the time i miss a day of taking it so i really even know if i would have any nausea without it taking nothing on my 14 days off as far as caffeine its just in my paper work to avoid it i really rely on it so i just avoided it during the 14 day regimen and had a little when i was on my days off figure if giving up my glass of wine at night i can give up my coffee in the morn do just fine tomorrow remind me are you taking the cytoxan orally or by infusion if it orally the actually infusion time is really short in and out within an 1 hrs including see the onc look forward to hearing from you tomorrow thinking you be just fine carol please help went for 11 of 12 taxol today in my slippers because shoes are just to painful to wear neuropathy started 2 treatments ago and is getting worse my feet hurt and are red but i can still walk treatment nurse spoke with the and they decided to cancel the treatment she said they would most likely cancel as well i feel uncomfortable like i am missing something my onc was unavailable and they think she is out next week as well i feel she should make the call to cancel the treatment not an that has no idea who i am any one else quittaxol early welcome runnergirl way done feels good it it is strange that we all have such different treatments been trying to guesstimate what my radiation schedule is going to look like but people on the rads boards with my same or close diagnosis vary so much i if i could avoid the neulasta i think taxol would be a breeze my side effects are all bone pain related neulasta pain has been brutal for me i read a review of the drug on line when trying to find some alternative to the already tried claritin zyrtec that said if it came down to me getting that shot again or coming down with cholora some deadly infection or whatever i would probably take my chances a body can take just so much haha this last time i took steroids and i only had firework bursts of pain instead of constant waves hey kay i just saw this and noticed my name in post as fate would have it i just switched to femara three days ago the arimidex fail me still ned but unlike most i started having increasingly annoying about for the past 8 weeks not horrendous or debilitating but getting worse so giving femara a trial for me staying very active kept the joint pain at bay but i did have to sit still and sleep every now and then when the got worse but a recent problem and as my mo gently pointed out in my late 50 s so a bit of arthritis may be at play too so until recently i had an easy time of it and i still carried on as usual i do take glucosamine chondroitin and it help with joint pain but still taking it in conjunction with femara i also take effexor but did so before bc as well during the worst of my menopausal times anyway been good to me and i hope cousin is too other than metastatic bc my mo says quite healthy i am however enjoying my summer vacation which means operating at a much slower pace i think better work some more exercise in to my days caryn hi ladies been a year now since the difficult first months of tamoxifen i would like to share what happened in the past months been away i had reconstruction surgeries since that first months i was going crazy from tamoxifen i just had my exchange surgery last march 11 when i first started on tamoxifen i had terrible mood swings depressive moods psychologist said i had moderate to severe depression hot flushes fatique joint pains hearing loss etc etc side effects got better a little bit when i split my dose to morning and night as one of the ladies here had suggested one year passed i feel so much better now i think my body has finally adjusted except i noticed this year i have become more forgetful and my vision has deteriorated so much this past few months but eent told me just age i have to wear progressive lenses now otherwise i have anymore depressive episodes i refused to take my antidepressant hardly have mood swings very occassional hot flushes rare fatique and joint pains hearing deterioration has slowed down but my hearing is still being monitored every 3 months i had endometrial biopsy before i started taking tamoxifen because i was having mid period spotting that time surprisingly i dont have that anymore however since the past months my cycle has changed to days instead of my regular 28 days taking the generic tamoxifen from kaiser crazyride 43 we are gonna be travelling to europe this saturday so i started taking baby aspirin today 3x a week to prevent blood clot i was taking baby aspirin when i first started taking tamoxifen but my eent told me to stop it because i get tinnitus from it so i will just take it this week and next week and then on the first week of july on our flight back here in the us i have compression sleeves without guntlet with me too for the flight but debating if i should wear it on the flight or just bring it just in case god forbid my friend that was diagnosed with inflammatory bc a month before me had surgery last friday for a mass behind her uterus that they saw on the us when they opened her up they found out her cancer was everywhere lungs aorta abdomen she is 33 y o divorced with a 9 and 12 yr old sons my heart breaks for her having a 4 yr old myself grateful i am alive right now and keep taking that tamoxifen as long as i can because i let cancer take me away from my family i do hope all of you here ladies for things to get better on whatever difficulty you are going through dearest jackie this is great news about xeloda the onc seems wonderful and the trip to baltimore is a commitment worth making i am also on xeloda and the onc recently added 50mg of cyclophosphamide to the xeloda as the tumor markers were beginning to rise despite all other indicators being good including shrinking of liver and skin mets zometa 3 monthly is a good sign it is very import to monitor an maintain your dental health as zometa is strong implicated in onj as i have fund out personally no longer on zometa hopefully the xeloda will address the bone mets in time thanks for sharing your great new love and best wishesfidelia wintermoon i had taxotere after the ac but that was actually worse for me other than the constipation mouth sores headaches and low white cell counts i was ok on ac with the taxotere i gained weight got neuropathy in my hands and feet shortness of breath and horrible pain in my hips arms and legs i actually passed out on my kitchen floor and my 9 year old had to help me crawl to the couch as bad as the ac was for me the taxotere was far worse i still have to take a diuretic every morning because my legs and feet still swell up if i and still no feeling in the bottom of my feet and i finished a year ago this past june i guess true that body handles the treatments differently i got the decadron along with benadryl iv with my taxotere but even with that i would get horrible hives and a fever and swelling in my arms and hands so the oncologist put me on a solu medrol dose pack basically more decadron it helped me tremendously prior to the pack i would get so short of breath my heart would race i felt so nauseated and i got so puffy the extra decadron made my chemo so much more tolerable just different for everyone looks like my diagnosis was pretty darn close to yours and i too am premenopausal and have been on fareston since may 20th actually i stopped taking it today because it appears the urinary tract infection symptoms been havingon and offsince june 12th could very well be aside effect i went to my general practitioner last week for a pee test and it came back negative for a uti upon calling my medical oncologist today about the problem his pa told me to stop the farestonfor 2 weeks and see if the symptoms subside she said that drugs like fareston and tamoxifen can create a hormone deficiency in the body whichcauses organ tissue to thin and become more prone to injury aside from this one issue i really had any major side effects since i started inthefirst week or 2 iwould feel very sleepy within an hour of taking the pill everyday had pretty infrequent minor hot flashes night sweats and loss of appetite with a brief bout of nausea now and then but it nothing i to get through melissalynni have been on taxol and avastin since feb 9th i had my 13thy treatment today doing really well on it so far i hope to continue on this path my side effects on avastinare sneezing and bloody nose only when i blow to hard but its not that bad and the taxol my hairhas thinned out but i still have have it i slick itback puthead band can really tell eyelashes are falling too a little tiredtoday but they give me 2benedryl pillsbefore treatment i also take 5 pills decadron pills before i leavefor treatmentstay strongdee hello my name is cathy i have been on femara for 2 years after taking tamoxifen for 16 months i had bone and joint pain as well as muscle pain i am much better now it kind of subsided about 6 months ago i am over weight and wanted to lose the weight and have cut the calories pretty much and am losing verrry slowly i read that femara cause weight gain but can make it hard to lose weight i believe it now if anybody has heard that i would like to know good luck with femara i have posted this in a couple other threads hoping to hear from lots of you so please ignore if already seen it then i decided it would be easier to start a new thread so forgive me for being repetitive question for everyone anyone i finished 6 months of x and taxotere in mid november had all the typical s e but plugged along managing them as they were not all at the same time i got a cold fungal infections under my arms and swollen eyes in the beginning the cold and mid december the rest i also started having joint pain all joints which has intensified so that it is excruitiating to get out of bed it gets better through the day with walking and daily activities and percoset but this is really bothering me my tms in mid january were absolutely wonderful ctc 0 ca15 3 31 cea they have continued to drop since may 2011 when i started chemo my scan at the end of june 2011 was excellent liver lesion could not be detected tumors on skeletal system were mostly gone except for three on my spine which were reduced by half september and december scans showed stable which is wonderful i will have my next scan in march and then return to work ugh my full time job which i love but not where i work kitchen design at the home depot i have been working my part time job at home oops off topic my joint pain has me very concerned i just got the results of the lyme tests done and they were negative i cried not because i was happy but because it would have explained things weird what this disease does to a gal pas so has anyone else experienced this the only thing i amgetting is zometa every other month my onc said that the joint pain should not be a coninuation of any s e after 2 months off which leads me to my next question of you all who is stable or ned but is on maintenance chemo what kind and how often my onc want me on any chemo until i need it because of the toxicity i understand but really like being out there with nothing he feels that i am doing very well and am being monitored closely so i am not really out there with nothing i trust him implicitly and respect his abilities not really the word i wanted but i suffer from he studied under larry norton at sloan he is very good but i always question which he just loves about me we actually get along very well and i feel that i am a part of my care team thanks so much theresa my port was put in during surgery but i would felt twinges for months afterwards then i realized one day i had forgotten it was in as for taxol and appetite the day of my taxol infusion i would have not appetite starting as soon as the infusion started i nauseated sick or even queasy just hungry although my taste buds were altered from the time i started ac through the end of taxol thetwo days following my taxol infusion everything tasted much worse than the normal weird taste bud thing bathroom thing i did go to the restroom a lot but i also drank a lot of water and they gave me saline drips during the infusion too chickad have you tried imodium next time when doing taxotere try sucking on ice chips starting about 15 minutes before through 15 minutes after i had a mouth sore the 1st time my onc told me to do this never had another i lost all my hair on ac but when i went on taxol my hair grew back never lost head hair but did loose eyelashes eyebrows ugh i came here looking for on too i started tamoxifen about 2 weeks ago followed by lupron 5 days later daily headaches started within a few days and i never get headaches so blaming the drugs felt very lethargic i have no energy my legs feel like wet noodles this week i started having nausea and body aches and felt like i have the flu i feel like absolute crap depressed and i feel like crying all the time and never been like that i know how i could go on for 5 years if i feel like this i called my onc today and they prescribed effexor worth a try so i picked it up today thanks barbie about the withdrawal warning anyone stop taking tamox or lupron seemed to me that my onc said the lupron was just a suggestion not a requirement i may see about stopping that temporarily to see if i can feel somewhat normal just when i thought gotten through the tough stuff i think this is worse than surgery and radiation thanks for letting me vent my husband understand laura wheely taxane agents both taxol and taxotere have nail lifting as a side effect other agents damage nails with ridges lines and peeling i iced my fingers and toes during the taxotere portion of my chemo using bags of frozen peas i brought them myself in a cooler and did this for each infusion in addition to taxanes causing lifting they can also cause neuropathy neuropathy can be tingling numbness or pain particularly in the extremities i used some supplements to try to keep neuropathy at bay 30g of 10g of powder dissolved in a cold drink 3 times a day and a capsule of b6 daily you should check with your mo on the icing they may say it work or necessary but i would do it anyway hurt only help and the supplements some will approve some hello i finished on i was on dd act i had a much harder time with taxol than ac the bone joint muscle pains were bothersome to say the least i am still experiencing muscle and bone pains especially in my back hurts the most when i move my torso from side to side i guess i thought it would be over with the end of chemo but that seem to be the case my 3 year old twins love to be picked up and i love to hold them so that adds to my pain i am sure then my husband hurt his knee and shovel the snow for a few days so i did a little bit of shoveling then i fell on the ice last tuesday pain in back was getting better yesterday then i got up at 3am in pain first time i got up from sleeping with pain so my question is for those of you who did taxol how long will this shit last i know cumulative but what the hell does that mean i need timelines of course i am sitting here thinking it has spread to my back and i am just angry and sad these days not sure what to do with myself i am not ok at home i am not ok at work why me why us then i think to myself that i never ask i me when good things happen to me so i am i question why me with this it just sucks i am sorry i am complaining i am just really in the dumps right now hello nisa welcome to our thread i was glad that i was able to help with the osteoporosis i was surprised that my name came up when you put in osteoporosis but we have discussed it on this thread and i have posted quite a bit on those other two threads that i mentioned in fact it was well after my breast cancer treatment that i discovered and it was through looking up hyperparathyroidism that i met sam 52 on the high calcium thread she then started the other thread about parathyroid problems and the connection with breast cancer of course an parathyroid causes osteoporosis and i think i have read that the same can happen with an thyroid the drug anastrozole arimidex can cause bone pain and osteoporosis and can worsen osteoporosis if you already have it the other side effects are anxiety depression diarrhoea headache hot flashes and weight gain so all in all not a nice drug but it is used to lower the level of oestrogen in the body so is an important drug for hormonal breast cancer this drug is given to women whereas tamoxifen nolvadex istubal valodex is an oestrogen antagonist a drug that blocks the effects of oestrogen is given most often to women however i have people i know here who were and were given tamoxifen for a few years and then switched to anastrozole tamoxifen also has nasty side effects which include possible blood clots strokes cataracts and uterine cancer it can also cause weight gain vaginal dryness leg cramps hot flashes and joint pain for this reason i have always said that despite all the dire comments we get about triple negative breast cancer i have always tended to be positive about being triple negative because there are no drugs available for us after the standard treatment of surgery chemotherapy and radiotherapy as for diet i think all we can do is try our best it is good that you are eating vegetables and fruit on a daily basis and you are lucky to have easy access to organic in california i do quite well in my local supermarket but organic for everything is not easy there is a lot of information about dairy products and growth factors igf in them that might be a risk factor in breast cancer especially hormonal one of the first things that my breast cancer consultant said to me back in 2005 was that she thought that dairy products were a risk factor and should be avoided i was not eating much in the way of dairy at the time anyway and i have been completely dairy free ever since diagnosis i know some women with triple negative breast cancer seem to think that dairy is not connected because it is but my oncologist told me long ago that cancer cells mutate and that triple negative does not necessarily start off as such and may start off as hormonal anyway concentrate on the good things that you eat with reference to carbohydrates we all have to be careful whatever our receptor status because the starch in carbohydrates is converted into sugar and we all know that we should be avoiding sugar we have to remember that some carbohydrates are fine and we need them for energy but what we need to avoid is the simple carbohydrates white bread white pasta white rice sugar etc we do need some complex carbohydrates such as whole wheat bread whole wheat pasta and whole grain rice of course fruit is fine but fruit juice is not so good because it is too concentrated as for soy there are differing opinions about this but i have read that fermented soy such as plain live culture yoghurt is fine i know that women with hormonal breast cancer tend to avoid soy but i think there might be some confusion about phytoestrogens in plant food which are supposed to be beneficial and the oestrogen from other sources i think as in all things we have to inform ourselves weigh it all up and make our own decisions i was wondering how it is that you lose weight fast do you lead a very active life it is such a pity that the drug arimidex causes so much damage women are vulnerable to bone loss and osteoporosis so taking this drug can only add to the problem ten years seems a long time to be on any drug but i think that is the way the standard treatment is going i would definitely try to find out what alternatives there are there are other drugs also aromatase inhibitors such as aromasin and letrosole but they probably have the same side effects but you could research them and ask about them here in the uk women with osteoporosis are offered bisphosphonates or strontium ranelate but i have always refused both because of nasty side effects i have made up my own treatment for osteoporosis as i said before and try to get my calcium from food i think everyone going through cancer treatment should request a dexa scan before and after their treatment this is the only way to know how your bones have been affected by your cancer treatment you may be interested to know that steroids can cause osteoporosis you may also be interested to know that the worst cases of osteoporosis are in the countries where lots of dairy products are eaten i hope this helps keep eating your broccoli and fruit such as blueberries keep in touch fond thoughts sylvia xxxx greetings to all my buddies i am sending lots of extra hugs out to jo june mamav marie sandee sherri paula alica and anyone else i have forgotten to name sounds like you all need some singlemom i had a lot of problems with depression when i started tamoxifen and actually quit taking it after a couple of months with that plus pain issues when i started it again i took half dose for a week then half dose twice a day for a week then full dose in the am i know if that helped or if it was my imagination but it seems that my body adjusted to it better with this approach great to hear from you carolyn and maureen carolyn send prayers and positive energy that all your tests come out ok i have a close friend who was 10 mos after me and went through lumpectomy chemo and rads she is on tamoxifen and she complains about the arthritic type of pain too wondering if it is a combo of us getting older and what our bodies have been through oh well past us now three years woohoo maureen do you have osteoporosis or osteopenia i was surfing the net one night gathering info about yoga and osteoporosis and found a study being conducted by become part of the study and am anxiously awaiting the dvd so i can start doing it on a daily basis hope i can be that consistent at home i think great you went back to school and changed careers good luck everyone have a wonderful thanksgiving and holiday season it will definitely be a busy time after thanksgiving love cathy tamoxifen was the drug that wiped out my brain wow it was profound i went on lupron and arimidex and had horrible joint too active for that changed to femara and did fine with that decided had enough at the 4 year point just more depressive stuff mild and i was already on zoloft a year later i had another cancer so i started aromasin mild aches but tolerable yet at the 2 year point i quit it with my blessing i promised to keep my weight down because those fat cells that store the estrogen it is a huge quality of life issue for those of us with early stage cancers and low risk of recurrence lifestyle changes and sticking to them may be a good alternative for people with more advanced cancer i presume to say i did tch x6 and i smelled it too not bad just different dh did not notice anything but i could smell it on my pillow and in my clothes my sense of smell was heightened too and made me nauseous too i am 5 months pfc now and on tamoxifen i sweat like a pig during hot flashes but a weird kind of sweat like all water no stink thank goodness cuz be impossible to be around i smell or taste the drugs during chemo but i can taste and smell the heparin used to flush my port too kind of nauseating and i have to look away while they are doing it hi all forgotten you just been feeling so exhausted and such sore tingly fingers difficult to type claire how are you doing with the abraxane do you have hand and foot trouble too my feet are ok mostly but monday one went completely dead and when i stood up i fell over am really bruised now still having some skin problems too though nowhere near as severe as with the taxol not sure if down to the abraxane or avastin or both i had any of the bone ache you mentioned though am also addicted to my hot water bottle helps me sleep very impressed by your arranging the party well done my hair fallen out completely yet i shaved it pretty short but just seems to be shedding slowly due for weekly chemo no 5 on thursday tina i hope the rads have done the job for you too margaret glad your throat is getting better have you tried manuka honey been eating it and is very soothing for my sore mouth have had some ulcers and stuff it is a natural antiseptic antibiotic i mix it in tea or soya yogurt which is lovely sarah great news really pleased for you hi to everyone else hope all doing ok xxx k8 this will not be what you want to hear i had 4 rounds of taxotere cytoxan 2 years ago my last treatment was in early june 08 and my lashes fell out about 3 weeks after that last infusion i think i had 4 hairs left on each of my upper eyelids and all my lower lashes were gone my brows thinned badly but at least a few brow hairs hung on so i could with eyebrow pencil like faith and crisct my brows and lashes fairly quickly then fell out a few months later and fell out again etc i think finally after enough cycles they got so i no longer noticed when a few of them would fall out the bad news my lashes never did grow back completely i used to have fairly long thick lashes but my lashes are now short and considered using latisse but i have blue gray eyes and latisse can permanently darken your eye color i did not want blue eyes with brown spots i also had other concerns about the lashes growing out fuzzy growth which heard can happen with latisse and of course i rarely bother to apply mascara anymore because my lashes are so darn short afraid stick that brush in my eyes and hit my contact lenses as for eyebrows the story is slightly different my individual brow hairs are as long as they were but they seem to be blonde instead of medium brown worse though is that they are much thinner than they used to be the growth used to be so thick that i had to prune them constantly to keep from looking like leonid brezhnev now they are so patchy that many of the individual brow hairs even overlap oh and the brow hairs i do have like to stick out in all different directions so do i pluck them or pity them the good news is that i have mastered the use of brow stylist pencils to fill in the gaps and even things out one thing i learned courtesy of our beloved alaskadeb was to use a color that is at least one step lighter than my hair color my hair is so i use a dark blonde eyebrow pencil of that particular brand as i said i am 2 years out from chemo and still drawing in eyebrows something i never had to do some of my may 08 chemo sisters are having this same difficulty one complication is that i have been on arimidex since finishing chemo and the are known to contribute to hair thinning i imagine i will need to help my brows and lashes forever the brow pencil actually works really well and it sure makes my eyes look better than if i use it my lifestyle is too casual too simple to bother with things like false eyelashes or hello so happy to find this thread after a lengthy discussion with my onc i have decided to go for the tamoxifen after everything readabout the was very hesitant ihave a history of a thrombosis blood clot which is also a side effect of tamox soi did not want to rush in to taking it but it seems that the benefts outweigh the risks for someone like me with an estrogen positive tumor and i found out yesterday i am pre menopausal i also have high cholesterol and i found out that tamox has been known to lower this wow an added bonus about the hair thinning my paper work nothing about that maybe it will be on the actual packaging when i pick up med today from pharmacy but i did read it can cause facial hair what wondering is howare we suppose to know ifwhat we are experiencing is a symptom side effect of the med or just a plain ole sign of menopause more things to have tothink about and probably loose sleep over i am 43 years old and i was diagonsed with breast cancer in october 2006 i had 8 rounds of chemo and 30 rounds of radiation i have been on tamoxifen for 1 year and i have put on 20 pounds since everthing most of the weight gain occured when i started the tamoxifen i was also put into menopause by the chemo i was very slim when all of this started and am beside myself i am grateful to be once again healthy but very very upset over this weight gain i also feel super healthy i am constantly tired i was very very healthy can someone give any advice on how they coped or lost weight and did this happen to anyone else log in to post a reply i just met with my oncologist on friday as i am starting tamoxifen now that all of my other treatments are over with i mentioned this test he was very familiar with it but said that the test is fairly new and they have enough information on it yet my oncologist did say that if i did not have any side effects to tamoxifen hot flashes joint pain etc that after one month of being on tamoxifen he would order the test he also mentioned that if tamoxifen was not working for me then he would put me on an ai instead but he wanted me to try tamoxifen first i am premenopausal or at least i was before i started chemo i had a period since march and started chemo the 2nd week of february i was disappointed to find out that i might actually start having periods again or spotting as i have liked this time away from them i have had hot flashes for years now but i know they will get worse from the tamoxifen which really bother me that much since at least i will know it is working i take my first pill tonight tangles i have dose dense taxol x4 then done they said the first tx takes the longest by tx 4 it will be 4 hours still a long time my cold is still hanging in there still feeling like crud hoping these antibiotics start working soon glad you had less bone pain this time around that is great news lisamm i have not exercised in a week and i think be doing any in the next couple of days my np said to lay low no working or anything and just rest my counts were very good so i am happy about that i have to listen to my body this time and just let it rest i have no energy anyway being sick on top of chemo really sucks the big one i know some of you have dealt with this in the past like getting kicked in the head when you are already down i hope all of you are well soo thoughtful to get all of those gifts great ideas congrats diamond yay no more ac i had a tough time with it too the last one put me in the hospital with antibiotics and transfusion thank god that was it so you plan now taxol doing 12 of those much easier for nausea i used xanax and heard of others using something stronger but from the same group on here ativan it relaxes your gi systems i was surprised when my dr prescribed it but definitely worked too bad your not in wa co ri you could get thc oil that works great there is a pill form less effective called marsinol good luck my gi is starting to get back to normal after a month from last ac taxol makes me so constipated so new side effects yaaaaay but take it over ac jo congratulations on being done with reconstruction that must just be a huge relief i too am on the same stupid little pill mo switched me from arimidex after the knee joint pain stated affecting qol i walked like an invalid the tamoxifen is a little easier on my knees but those hot flashes fun thought i was over and done with them so much fun to take a pill you have to take and bring those flashes back hi everyonewas about to write something just ended up putting in another quote when my friends came to take me out to a celebratory dinner for finishing my rads had a good time but went to a place none of us had ever been so have the charm and substance they were hoping for it was ok with me we could have been at kfc as long as it was with friends did enjoy the margarita though i never tasted alcohol probably a good thing for someone who had a drink since her diagnosis that way i stayed in my chair and laughed at the appropriate places had an enjoyable day not through yet in my pantry and kitchen trying to give it that hgtv minimal look the pantry make it but ok needed to clean by starting in the pantry forever it seems and all of you would agree if you had seen the giant dust bunnies trying to attack me julie how fortunate that chemo is not on your list it can be very difficult for some and nice to hear that you will be able to avoid it good news too that you have other pain meds hard to feel decent about anythingwhen you are in distress you have had a rough time so hopefully the new meds will give you more stamina for your road ahead wendyty it is good to hear from you and about you sure is good news that you only have one a c left to go i think i mentioned maybe here just recently that 4 a c were about all i could handle of course now that essentially through txs they seem like they were as bad as they really were but at the time the last couple were a struggle partly because they were a which too hot but knowing too that it the end of chemo since i had the 4 taxotere to go those were basically a whole lot a much shorter infusion time as well but it still seemed like chemo was forever hope your taxol will be much easier my biggest complaint was a bad mouth flavor for two or three days and some mild joint bone pain which enough to keep me awake so bad at all jan i got your card as well and wonderful to be done i still felt bad about being done or depressed or much of anything maybe it is still too thrilling not to have to always be planning for the next step and so wonderful to be back in my own if it is majorly filthy with dust bunnies half as big as me not working hard loping along more than anything else but i can quit when i want too instead of when i have too i never thought be so anxious to clean but it feels great well i hope you all have had a wonderful you did and i hope you have a great day tomorrow full of life and love jackie mel no right after finishing a c i was suppose to start taxol i did the first taxol and had such horrible bone pain that they decided to switch me over to taxotere every three weeks so i only had one infusion of taxol i wish i had done the ice thing we traveled two hours to get to treatment so it would have been worthless to try and bring ice i did chew ice though while getting tratments and i think that helped some i am soooo craving donuts now going to eat a protein bar to stave off my craving lol i had letrozole to shrink the cancers prior to surgery after 15 years of hrt early complete hysterectomy yes it was grim instant menopause complete with etc however because i am retired i think that made it easier to cope with just go my own pace etc these tips may help take tablet at night not morning junk the memory foam mattress they reflect heat back to your body thin double duvet with an extra single one for his side of the bed thin layers of clothes not big jumpers easy to shed a layer buy a chillow via google bit pricey but worth the money they suck all the heat out of your body coffee even decaff and alcohol set off my flushes also i was changed to anastrozole after 15 months and that suits me better than letrozole flushes are more of a glow and much rarer could your original hrt consultant offer advice menopause clinic or something it is awful and like adding insult to injury but it does seem to ease off over time hope this helps grumpy my nose runs a lot my understanding is that cytoxan brings on sinus issues for some plus lost many of my nose hairs so nothing to catch the drips welcome suebee 48 there are many days this board has kept me sane and helped me figure out what questions to ask plus we dispense hugs freely my burning issue du jour i find myself stressing about work stuff keeping clients happy keeping the money coming in i know we all have different situations and some are job hunting i know regaining my health is most important so why am i letting this cr bother me maybe no great answer but welcome and trust your perspectives in return i promise to catch up on posts sometime this weekend shazza great news that doing so well on taxol on taxol every three weeks and my hair has grown back so hopefully yours will again soon btw started having having nosebleeds again for no reason changed my routine anyway good luck and fingers crossed about the hair xx i have invasive ductal carcinoma grade 3 size x x and i recently had a lumpectomy they removed 24 lymph nodes and found cancer in 2 of them i am 46 yrs old and have not had menopause yet also on my diagnosis the er receptor is pr receptor her 2 neu negative and ki 67 is high the first oncologist seen is recommending my chemotherapy include doxorubicin vesicant infusion therapy cytoxan and taxol he told me i will lose all my hair for certain including eyebrows eyelashes etc and he also said i have a 50 chance of the cancer coming back i have already scheduled 2 appointments for a 2nd opinion but i have to wait over a week and i am very curious if you think this is the correct treatment for me log in to post a reply i saw my onc last week and asked about effexor for hot flashes he said it has too and maybe i should try tamox or femara i was stunned but say anything because i think tamox has more right i would like to keep on the arimidex as it is generic and the best tx for post menopausal estrogen positive breast cancer patients i meet with the np next week and will talk with her should i try tamox or switch should i give it a few more months for a few days the hot flashes seemed to decrease but now they seem to be on the increase again and i definately want to have to deal with them for the next 5 years vjsjl just saw your post on pristiq so i will ask about this too thanks hi maria i am one of these who took anastrazole for 16 months and i was becoming literally and quickly disabled with all these joint muscle bone pains started losing my hair again thinning could not sleep and became walking zombie falling asleep at the wheel gained weight hot flashes could not exercise and was so miserable and depressed i decided to not to take anastrazole anymore my oncologist was ok with that i refused to take tamoxifen because it has such a horrible and risky se like thrombosis and uterine and ovarian cancers and i tried to switch to aromasin however from that med my hands were so much in arthritic pain i even write or wash my hands without pain i literally felt like 80 years old i am turning 53 this year i am almost 2 weeks off the anastrazole and i lost 5 lbs in first week i still have lost of pains and tired easily not sleeping well and still have hot flashes however my husband noticed that i have more energy and complain much about pains also for some reason i think about cancer much anymore i think that pill was sort of reminder for me that i had a cancer i am taking a risk of reoccurrence but i am surgically menopausal so have tons of estrogen in my body i would like to have a quality of life and if i live long so be it i also try to find alternative herbal and untraditional methods to heal detoxify eat right good luck with your decision if i would be 10 years older i would never even tried this adjuvant therapy aftersurgery chemo and radiation with stage 1 no nodes involved i think was enough for me to prevent reocurrence raisa kalyla i had 4 rounds of taxol and was told that it could cause peripheral neuropathy i did getit but it too bad my fingertips were numb and sore at times and i had aching here and there sometimes when i take a hot shower my fingers tingle and ache i finished chemo in feb and i notice these as much anymore i know anything about how cancer recurs in any particular case but a good chance with treatment that it take it a day at a time and try to focus on the good your treatment will do for you in your mind picture those little cancercritters being totally anililated by taxol keep them off guard and on the run sugarplum where is kelso i have an aunt and cousins in kirkland and my husband was born in bellingham happy day to all you moms my mom would have been 90 today may 11 i miss her every day julie for what its worth tamoxifen can bring on any symptoms that go along with menopause if depression feeling blue is one of these and i believe it is that can come with the territory you might want to consider asking your oncologist about cyp 2d6 gene issues and how you in particular metabolize tamoxifen i have just been reading about this on these forums so you might want to read up on it as i understand it it turns out that some people have a genetic predisposition to metabolize some meds better than other people and tamoxifen is one of the meds on the list that can be effected by gene issues these are not the same gene issues as brca 1 or 2 i have been on tamoxifen for five years now and have just been with a very unlikely recurrence with bone mets stats were likelihood and am wondering if i might be a poor metabolizer of tamoxifen as far as being distressed by your talk of getting more aggressive i completely understand your desire to move on but so much depends on the specifics of your unique situation your personal risk assessment and how aggressive you are willing to be only you can decide these things with the guidance of your onc your husband and others you trust be afraid to seek out 2nd opinions especially when considering more aggressive options or irreversable ones like removing your ovaries hang in there orchiddiagnosis july 2004 dcis and 5mm tumor stage 1 er her 2 mastectomy 04 tamoxifen for five years brca 2 dx mets to bone 09 firstly mary i am the most easily influenced person so now all day i am going to be ooooooooklahoma ing thank you thank you very much elizabeth more waiting ughhh just enjoy being grandma to aubrey and know that all here pulling for you ruth and mary louise so sorry for your losses retriever hope everything is okay with your pup theresa you have to experiment and find out what works best for your body as everyone metabolizes differently i take my femara at lunchtime and i switched to evening as people were saying how they slept better doing it at night well i was amped up and awake all night doing it that way i did go to the gym last night and did my rpm spin class but i had a miserable day evening as along with those santa ana winds came allergies woke up sneezing at 4am and had dripping nose sneezing and a pain in my eye all day anyway after class came home took a couple of benadryl and went to bed even turn on the computer which is a first patoo forget going to working out full time in nicaragua so you need to do a little before you go so be ready for it ruth in case you forget anything i have it on good authority they have shops in iowa girls this is my mantra for traveling stress if you forget anything just buy it when you get there i go up and down i spend a few hours certain a relapse and planning for that then i spend half day thinking probably nothing and not worrying then i go back to tension and nervousness than i wonder how i could have wasted time thinking i could get it again i plan for surgery and chemo and then i realize that most people never have it recur i had an easy time with everything chemo herceptin etc i was very positive throughout there were parts i even enjoyed has been the most difficult because of my frozen shoulder and tamoxifen aches i have not had a healthy day in two years and that is beginning to get me down and my mind starts to believe i am having a relapse i was sure my cancer had metasized to liver or ovaries due to the bloating and weight gain i have but as soon as i had my ct yesterday i stopped thinking that way weird the way your mind works sometimes i checked a couple of websites that review the effects of tamoxifen all of them mentioned that sometimes tamoxifen caused women to experience bone muscle or joint pain usually this pain disappeared after continued used and was associated with good tumor response pain meds like tylenol were suggested to treat the pain however life is too short to take a medicine that makes you totally miserable and cancer is too risky to not take anything if you are at high risk it sounds like you need to talk with a breast cancer oncologist specialist and go over what kind of cancer you have what treatments might work as well or better than tamoxifen and see what your options are some of those options not suit either but at least you would have an idea of what else you could do i am on exemestane an aromatase inhibitor i get joint pain from it but the nurse practitioner had me tested for vitamin d deficiency treatment with prescription vitamin d worked pretty well though the stuff is not working quite as well if that worked with the tamoxifen it would be a cheap and easy fix one blood test and then one pill a week if you are on the prescription vit d good luck hi sal yes i get the lot at times been on tamoxifen since april this year and aches is my main se it seems to go between hips back etc my legs get stiff if i sit down for too long and takes a while hobbling about to loosen them up yet i can walk the dog for several miles without issue once i get going i was warned to expect all this and more so i feel pretty pleased to only suffer with the aching side sure alls ok but natural to worry xx thanks for your response i have been hoping those not necessarily older but those wiser about these things would have responded been on arimidex for 15 months now and new complications such as hashimotos other autoimmune and osteoporosis are now in full flair that my other medical issues and conditions and then treatments mask or obscure lots of my blood tests how would i know where i stand other than a vacation the only way i can think of is to take a break then the question becomes for how long my other issues are neuropathies and osteoporosis with the cancer stuff on top of it it well gets to points rather quickly any help here please would be really greatly appreciated thank you all in advance and later too i have been on tamoxifen since mid oct 2013 5 months my worst se is dry eyes got so bad i ended up scratching the surface of both eyes i like to wear contacts but now only can wear them about of the time i used to and am always using drops i have night sweats which wake me but i am able to fall back asleep quickly once and awhile i will have a hot flash during the day but they seem to be increasing i had some joint pain but that goes away with exercise and it seems to be getting better i am constipated and will be very bloated at times which is my second biggest se complaint i never had a problem before i was nauseous the first week i started but that quickly went away my nails are now brittle but hair seems ok been taking biotin so sorry stuck with such crummy neuropathy stuff how i hope you get some relief and all the rest of the women on this thread that deal with painful debilitating nerve issues mine are just numb issues but join your rant because i had foot neuropathy a year before my bc diagnosis my onc gave me ac instead of tch she hoped i could handle taxotere w herceptin later the ac increased my neuropathy after the first 2 tx doubling the numbness in my feet to my ankles used to be just in my toes i iced my feet for tx 3 which may have kept it from increasing but after tx 4 of just adriamycin and not icing my feet thinking that omitting the c would help my neuropathy went to my finger tips and even my face felt slightly numb and still does just had brain mri and clear thank heaven going straight to herceptin more hoping the numb feet is all that will stay it runs in my family so been prepared for this but i had 30 years to get to this point instead of within 3 months dang it worried it will increase further than my and foot neuropathy they were able to walk and do things despite the numbness but i may not be so lucky due to the affect of chemo i have a neurologist that told me last year there was nothing that could be done for me since i experiencing pain and the cause of neuropathy was unknown also feeling more clumsy and dropping things too i think chemo messing with our concentration and nerves in our extremeties doing feet leg xercises from the site i paste the link computer issues but if you go to the site and type in exercises for idiopathic peripheral neuropathy it should work basic exercises that help your balance etc is anyone taking acetyl l carnitine or lipoic acid these are usually taken during chemo to prevent neuropathy but my onc neurologist and pharmacist advise it i think on the fence about the issue of amino acids building strenthening cells including cancer cells but the studies in the us going on now about supplements will help get them off the fence soon i think despite my doubts of their advice i chose to go along with my dr s and hope i regret it anyway supplements are ok now that done with chemo so thinking of taking them been taking b6 othe b vitamins already please let me know if they are part of your medicine cabinet thanks for any experience or opinions joanne allison i just read your post i just took my 5th taxol today the metallic taste went away for me quickly as you can see by the time the steroid is killing me too i sleep i am hungry all the time it really stinks i haev gained ponds a week since on the taxol starting tomorrow i will write down everything a weaight watchers approach without dieting the steroids stayed in my system only a couple of days the first time was worse because of the higher dose i am sorry about your huband i hope you feel better gapeach there is always hope ibc is aggressive and mda does those clinical trials but in my opinion have made her wait 2 months to start a treatment since she is ibc recurrence see if we can help you make a list of questions and ideas for the doctor tough to do but this is the beginning so talk with you mom if she wants to go all in help her by advocating for her if the onc says she only has one or two more options help give onc ideas suggestions from women on this board who are living years past stageiv and yes stage iv is terminal but can you see all the women here on this stageiv forum been here 15 years possible there are many chemos for er so you may have to turn the onc around and tell him keep focused on keeping her alive and not statistics or other she probably first had adriamycin cytoxan red devil with the taxotere and then you said she was on arimidex so that means the arimidex stopped working time to switch to femara or aromasin which are the other two ais aramotose inhibitors ais blocked the estrogen that was feeding the cancer er ais cause neuropathy what helped me is taking glucosamine with chondroitin in capsules dissolve and work quicker than pills caplets do you know what her her 2 receptor is positive or negative negative is good but if positive there are drugs for it like herceptin that work miracles bone mets usually get zometa or xgeva is rfa an option for her spine nerve pain an outpatient procedure that burns the nerve endings i just had it done in my c3 c7 and it has made a great difference for me in my neck if your wish is to fight the cancer then tell her doctor not to give up on her and that mom wants to live as long as possible it becomes a qol quality of life issue oncs have told me this for years and still going when mom is ready to stop then you should all support her decision and not tell her she has to fight i use the word fight but it is not a sign of weakness or quitting or giving up when a patient decides had enough i had my 5th taxol last tuesday my white countsis down so i had to come in and get a shot for 3 days otherwise i had to delay 5 i still think that t h is worst than i expected nauseous have stomach ace and the night sweats together with theinsomnia makes it difficult to get a good nights sleep at least when i was on ac i slept a lot and i had more than 1 day to feel okay before the next infusion hi kelly minimacsmom is rightthat the fac is suckier are you getting your chemo at mda or do you live elsewhere dr alvarez is my oncologist at mda but i get my chemo here in nebraska toward the end of taxol i started experiencing neuropathy in my toes and fingertips also my toenails started turning purple once the neuropathy started i began taking l glutamine and acetyl l carnetine as well as gabapentin the neuropathy is better and i hope it will eventually clear up you might ask your oncologist if any of those medications are right for you there is information on these boards about icing fingernails and toenails to keep them from doing what mine are doing i just find it until very late in the taxol treatment hello everyone i have read your posts for awhile but this is my first time posting i am 34 years old with 3 small children i was diagnosed with breast cancer last nov stage iia no node involvement i had a double mastectomy since we have tested positive for the brca gene i went through 4 months of chemo finishing in april i am now taking tamoxifen and getting used to the idea of being in menopause at 34 i am preparing for my second stage reconstruction next week throughout chemo i have tried to keep life happy and normal for my 3 children however sometimes i am overwhelmed with first the shock of it all anxiety some fear of recurrence these feelings come and go but my issue is that my parents keep telling me too negative not being positive enough and i should just get over gone and i need to move on i am just not there yet i am still trying to make sense of everything and adjust to this new life new body and all the changes menopause brings anything you can share would be apreciated log in to post a reply gaynor it was interesting to read that you switched from arimidex because of acid reflux and sore throat you might have read some of my posts about having a sore throat for the whole 5 years of arimidex it was listed as a side effect so i just dealt with it never imagined it might be from acid reflux i am now on nexium for acid reflux as the sore throat never went away after stopping arimidex also i took ibuprofen for joint aches and that made the acid reflux worse about getting your cholesterol checked i can not imagine that has not been done arimidex is known to cause elevated cholesterol and blood pressure i think if i were you i would be pushing for those tests i never had high blood pressure in my life until i went on arimidex now 7 months of being off i have cut my bp pill to half and my bp is almost normal cholesterol went down 22 points after being off arimidex 2 months still too high but i am losing weight finally and trying to get it down with diet asl far as i know there are no symptoms of high cholesterol you can get dizzy and or a headache with high bp but usually there are no symptoms my bone density was checked after being on the arimidex 1 year then again in 3 years as it was really good the first time i will get checked again in another 3 years jo your doctors are insistent about tamoxifen or similar estrogen blocking drugs because you tumor was no doubt estrogen positive so it can be fed by estrogen and therefore recurr i too take femara similar and deal with hot flashes i have an overhead fan that i have on every night even in the dead of winter if i have a sleepless night i take an ambien sleep medicine and it will put me to sleep i only use them if sleep becomes a real problem and notice that i can usually sleep without them the night after my radiation oncologist told me to try vit e tablets short term to help with the hot flashes and it did until i was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and lost my thyroid but i would rather insure that my cancer stay under control and use a fan or other means of addressing the menapausal symptoms but this is my choice erica and maryann i had taxotere three tx then a three month break because of a second surgery and three more tx all with carboplatin and herceptin too so i got to lose my hair twice the first time my head was really sensitive and cutting it short helped but i stand the small hairs falling everywhere so i got it shaved not all of my hair did fall out that time so when i noticedit was beginning again to fall out i cut it short andwore a hair net when eating or fixing food and to sleep six months after the last chemos tx i had my first hair style cut appointment by that time my hair was very thick curly previously straight as a rod and full some of my friends say that while the first time it grew back the color was a beautiful white gray and the second time it is a darker color with some gray for sure that is about the same amount of time it took for the horizonalchemo lines to grow out of my fingernails i felt that hair loss kept the cancer sign on my forehead for people very glad that sign has been removed even though still in tx with herceptin it is nice to not always be treated like sick hello ladies sitting here after reading all your posts feeling i maybe can put up with the horrible femara thank you for all your experiences and ideas on self help have had 5 years of tamoxafin and now into the 2nd year of a 5 year course of femara i also take medications for high blood pressure and osteoporosis i hate taking pills tamoxafin worry me apart from the hot flushes but femara is not good first numbness in my hands at night which would wear off with movement now i have constant pain in both hands throughout the day sometimes like a red hot poker especially in the joint at the base of my first finger fingers stick like but the mad thing is that different fingers all the time sure the dr thinks imagining things lately been getting sharp cramps in the arch of one foot and stiffness in my hips and back after sitting or driving 68 and walk like a crone sometimes i keep playing the piano and hope not doing too much damage and have just started swimming in a heated pool but hey girls still here thanks again hi ladies hope everyone is doing as well as possible i had a bone scan done last thursday my oncologist said to wait until after taxol was finished but my family doctor said to do it and her office made the appointment i am 60 and have never had one i was suppose to be getting one every 2 years after my last period the last one was long ago after the lining of my uterus was lazored out due to heavy bleeding at least now i have something to compare the next scan to the oncologist ordered a mri with and without contrast on my brain having it done tuesday he said what is going on is not chemo brain i think allergic to taxol or what it is mixed with while i was having my last treatment i have 8 more my brain went blank several times it felt so strange and scary i have been having neurothopy in my feet legs hands and face he said he has never seen it in the face before but i read it could happen in face too everyday it seems like something different happens to this old body my blood counts are still so low neutrophils count was after 2 neupogen shots now they say i have 3 again after the next treatment if there is one the oncologist will decide after the mri if the treatment plans will change there is an end to this journey one day read on these boards how some of us get changes in our vision due to taxol has anyone gotten floaters when they never had them before called the mo as it put me in a total panic getting scheduled for brain mri and appt with eye doc want to make sure this is not mets to the brain ugh yes i was taken off taxol because of neuropathy even though it was working and getting rid of my liver lesions it got to the point i was falling down or passing out then falling down it was also taking a toll on my whole body my bloodwork was bad there are other chemos you can be put on in place of taxol i e there are other safety nets for you perhaps your onc is planning on you having the surgery and if required to go on another chemo after that if you scan is good perhaps an ai ok i worry too much about this elizabeth hi ladies been on here for a long time but am having problems with anastrazole and wonder if anyone else is the same boat had a lumpectomy and snb oct 2011 no chemo then rads and anastrazole the hot flushes fatigue joint pains and headaches were manageable as they seemed to take it in turns but over the last few weeks all been coming together plus a new wrinkle dizziness this is freaking me out funnily enough not so much because of the obvious paranoia it must be a brain tumour aaaargh but because my dad died of dementia which started as a series of dizzy spells and got worse tias there seems to be quite a lot of stuff on us sites about anastrazole causing dizziness but not so much here seagull i too have no problem with hair loss and was doing a lot of cycling and the joint pains were not bad i go to yoga once a week try to do it times at home it helps with the joint pains and with stress i think the stress and anxiety is as bad as the physical side effects and probably makes them worse so anything you can do to reduce it is going to help you beat the big c the breast cancer haven charity in leeds london and hereford provide all kinds of support to bc patients fantastic and all free however if too far away they also have great relaxation cds on ah anastrazole the gift that keeps on giving happy new year and good luck everyone monicas fdm taxotere definitely causes nerve issues be sure to share the comments with your mo keeping a daily log of symptoms can be helpful too jacquie it sounds like heartburn that has worsened for me with each treatment and prechemo i never had any issues with heartburn it does make my throat very raw as some have suggested tums may help but you may need something stronger too zantac helped me a little and my mo suggested prilosec as well i hope you get some relief if not do not hesitate to call when you work in medicine you know that somedays you work the holidays just the way it is our side effects do not take the holidays off so if you need something call teamkim i hear you on the rant sc i am so sorry to hear that you lost your father to stomach cancer so recently you have had way more than your share to deal with in these past few months your father sounds like a very wise man the finger pain can be from the taxotere or from neulasta but it also could be a sign of neuropathy especially since it is affecting function you definitely need to mention it to your mo prior to your next chemo because sometimes they will adjust your dosage if they believe it is neuropathy it is thansgiving i am thankful for a lot but specific to bc i am thankful to have had all of you here to get me through these challenging times you all just get it venting here has helped me to keep more positive with my dh and kids and such because once i let my frustratious out i generally feel much better i am thankful for my bs and ps who have always been incredible through this ordeal both talented and compassionate and very willing to do whatever they could to get me back to my job i am thankful for my mo though he really really frustrates me sometimes when he does not take some of my odd symptoms as seriously i do feel that he gave me a voice in my care and some of the more typical side effects which could have been more serious he did evaluate thoroughly to rule the bad stuff out i am thankful to my coworkers they showed up at my house with a fire truck 15 minutes after hearing of my diagnosis bearing flowers ice cream and pie 24 of them shaved their heads with me i am also blessed with an amazing group of friends who have filled our freezer with more food than we can possibly eat without ever being asked my dh and kids have been amazing as well i am feeling very blessed today hi ladies new to this thread but not new to cancer and the many treatments i just finished rads on thursday and i picked up my arimedex yesterday but am so afraid to take it i did tamoxifen for 5 years starting 13 years ago and did pretty well except for the hair loss and hot flashes just finally got rid of hot flashes and hate to have them start again i also have fibromyalgia and hate the thought of adding more pain on top of that i know i have to start soon thanks for this thread and for letting me vent stephanie claire in answer to your question about the port my cousin and i had our ports implanted in the same week she started chemo within days of having the port implanted she had no pain and no infection however i started chemo weeks after my port was implanted and i found the needle painful the first time it was inserted into the port i read later that scar tissue forms and may cause pain in starting her chemo treatment right away my cousin probably have the chance to form much scar tissue so she felt no pain at all she also never had an infection inher port but i ended up with an infection in mine that spread when my counts dropped so the possibility of infection seem to depend on how long you wait after the port is implanted to start chemo you just have to pay close attention to the port the nurses also will check your port before every treatment if the area looks redor hurtsat all tellthem or your oncologist when i was first diagnosed the idea of taking all of those medicines worried me too i never was the type of person who took medicine i never had to like you i questioned if i needed steroids but all of that medicine and the chemoturned out to benecessary like theothers have stated youwill only be given steroids decadron along with emendfor a few days when having an infusion assuming be receiving a c treatments after a c i was giventaxol and with taxol i given steroid pills to take instead the decadron was infused as a right before each taxol infusion i was told the steroid helps to combat nausea as chemo patients not givena high enough dosagein steroids to cause the side effects you mentioned i was on zometa since june 2008 i always had a fever with zometa and joint pain the last time i had zometa the joint pain because really severe they switched me to aredia this time around and i felt great no joint pain and no fever or flu symptoms make sure you take alot of calcium every day like 1800 mg or more it makes a big difference with the bone pain jennifer hi all well still in plaster have been back to clinic and again had to have the bone reset as still not healing properly must say im really fed up as so cant manage to do a lot for myself lymphodemia seems to be ok just the usual swelling i can feel it as my cast suddenly become tight strange feeling hopefully it will heal in the next 3 weeks or i may face surgery to pin the bone together a side effect of arimadex is thinning bones as my doc mentioned i should have been prescribed bone strenghtheners unfourtunatly i wasnt so who knows wether this is the case but worth looking into i think pamelakay i am so happy to have chemogate return to our board thank you my argument with the chemo nurse on wednesday was that the nausea i was experiencing during chemo could not have been caused by herceptin or taxol she had no nausea meds on order give me compazine since i was driving myself etc besides these drugs cause nausea i finally took one of my own nausea meds they turned off the herceptin infusion until the nausea was under control finally i got to go home geez tmi alert a week ago my dh was at the mo with me she told us that chemo can affect all mucus membranes including tearing down there so dh afraid to touch me for a week i told him last night let him know if the pain was bad and darn it all after a nice time together i was bleeding thank god it last long but was a bit disconcerting taxol 2 day 3 missed the mac truck exhaustion just started right in with the pain today is pretty bad no vicodin for me they are keeping me on a lower class of drugs but at least i have refills of it please assume that dentists are aware of problems associated with biphosphonate treatment i had been receiving zometa injections since january 2003 right after my bc metastasized to my spine in august of 2008 my dentist recommended that i have my left lower wisdom tooth extracted i wa very worried but my dentist assured me that the risk was vanishingly small and that the entire onj story had been vastly overblown by the media long story short the pain from the extraction site continued until february of 2009 along with a painful earache at which time i went to a maxillofacial surgeon who did oral surgery and found dead bone in my jaw at the site of the wisdom tooth extraction i had gone back to my dentist three times complaining of pain in my jaw and ear he kept assuring me that the site was healing albeit slowly and that the pain in my ear could not be related to the wisdom tooth removal although i had never had an earache before in my life in addition to enduring excruciating pain having to take antibiotics for sixty days and use an oral rinse that turned my teeth the color of tobacco my oncologist will no longer give me zometa on which i had been doing very well because i have a confirmed case of onj had i known what the outcome would be i would have chosen to live with the wisdom tooth but i trusted my dentist instead of myself my ear and jaw still hurt hi guys well almost 4 weeks post chemo and feeling better a little more energy i feel better however i still have muscle weakness in my legs so i do excercises every day to strengthen my surgery date us april 22nd it was decided that i will have a mastectomy and no plans for recon yet joma so sorry for your mom this is not normal side effects taxol is very hard on the muscles and joints i had a hard time after 11 and 12 very tired sore legs itchy burning skin but no paralyses maryfox i get hungry either but my taste buds are coming back thk god and i am gladly eating stuff i before i actually gained a few pounds oops had to buy some new jeans that fit last weekend all my other ones were too snug lol worry it takes at least a month fir all chemo a d steroids from decadron to leave your systems so its normal that our appetites etc are screwed up septmom not much you can do for fatigue remember taxol is accumulating in your system just eat well and rest rest your body needs it take care cheryl between my eyes and my nose a regular fountain it is very pleasant not i had my final tch today actually it was just hc my doc pulled the taxotere because my liver function was funky it changed from last go round so he decided i need it and pulled it no hard feelings on my part he thinks the funky liver may be why feeling so fatigued and out of breath at times and pulling the taxotere he feels will help with the leg balloons had an ultrasound to check for clots and nothing go for an echo in 2 weeks just to rule out any heart issues so happy to have this phase behind me next herceptin every 3 weeks through march 2011 and tamoxifen and i start on the biphosphonate study tomorrow for 36 months i have been on tamoxifen for over a year now last month i had my final reconstructive surgery and on that day my blood pressure was high all day just figured it was the stress and anxiety because of surgery but a week later it was still high and 3 weeks later it was still high and now my onc thinks it may be from tamox i am seeing my primary dr this week to discuss has this happened to anyone else i had a year of herceptin too after ac and th thanks log in to post a reply had my final taxol today so i guess finished with chemo i am having a terrible time with itching taking benadryl and helping a bit but still itching i wonder if the taxol i start having this problem until a week ago and it has gotten progressively worse just sick of the from this chemo in the minority but ac was a breeze compared to this my feet and sometimes my fingers tingle i am praying that this neuropathy goes away like they said it would i just finished my last chemo a little over 14 hours ago and already nervous about the next step do radiation so on to arimidex and shots to shut down my ovaries i had a chest ct scan prior to chemo in october and they saw a couple of nodules in my lung that was probably nothing but the radiologist suggested a follow up scan i had that today a little upset about this and i now realize that in the future any scan or test is going to make me think cancer i used to feel this way about mammograms a sense of dread with my mind going places it this is going to be happening for the rest of my life the fear and anxiety that they get it all or that chemo taking now to clean up any cells that might have been missed work like it should have or the hormone therapy work i recurred on tamoxifen sorry to ramble like this but you guys are the only ones that get this everyone i talk to is congratulating me for being finished and i truly hope i am but i feel happy like i thought i would maybe in 4 weeks or so the will start to go away and have more energy be happier but moving on and trying to get back to a normal life is going to be a challenge mentally hope everyone is doing okay and hanging in there allison yes on ac then taxol later hair was thinning badly starting day 13 and now day 16 like a of hair i had it cut to about an inch all over happy to hear the brows may hang in there going to try cold therapy on the brows during the infusion to see if that works like the cold caps do carla thanks for the info on facial hair i will have to check those strips out hopefully your husband will be fine and your daughters can take turns staying with your husband so you can go to new york feeling the ups and downs of anastrozole i was really happy sunday and into monday then monday afternoon i was in tears and i know why rather depressed last night now i am ok not up or down first treatment with zometa on 6th may have had a bad reaction too bone pain muscle and joint pain high fever sore throat blocked nose back pain i thought taxol was bad but this is worse have used up my paracetamol allowance already will try ibuprofen next how long will this last i am on zometa as preventative 2 x year am thinking i have the next infusion cannot handle this when will i feel better actually spent most of the night crying in agony anyone give me some good news that this last long wow you are all troopers much respect and love still on iv abx after 5 days in the hospital on it now been on home iv abx for a week infection over right tissue expander is looking better was quite the scare of if i had to have it pulled out since prior to the hospital i did max mg of amoxicillin pills last bag of abx is tomorrow night then on prophylactic abx all through chemo not cherishing that as not a pill popper even though i know chemo wrecks more havoc than abx just the combination i think is upsetting before this cancer shit i rarely even took a tylenol for the very occasional headache i got much less anything else so this is like wow for me 5 am in ca in 3 hours i meet my new mo not sure have a plan with schedule and details on meds though the other one was thinking ac 4 rounds every 2 wks and taxol 12 wks after that appt i go to office for them to see infection is ok now per ps and infection doc so i can get a date for port sx once all this is in place before port sx getting my hair buzzed short going to miss my nice wavy curly shoulder length hair i have androgenetic alopecia so i know all mine coming back been thinning at the top pretty badly for 10 years but with my wavy type of hair able to do brush backs comb overs to hide it sometimes needing some scalp makeup to cover the areas so trying to prepare myself that my hair be coming back in all glory after all is said and done wishing you all a better day than yesterday read your stories every day helps me prepare for when i start which thinking is in weeks xo there is a great thread on taxol with lots of information about ses including effects you might want to check that out and ask for feedback there too been getting lots of good information as i go through taxol myself i completed my four dd ac and will be having my fifth of 6 dd taxols this coming thursday after the first taxol i had no neuropathy at all after the second i had a little tingling in my left thumb and first two fingers after the third i noticed tingling in both hands and a little in my feet my mo reduced my taxol a little bit since the fourth been a little more difficult i do notice however that by the end of the two weeks after treatment right before the next tx the neuropathy gets a little better no one has offered me neurotin or anything else at this point and i realize i could ask for it so i may before the next tx i stopped taking tamoxifen at 3 years into it the joint pain extreme weight gain and many other side effects were not worth it to me my onco did not believe that the drug was causing any of the side effects i complained of he told me to go back on it ask me what i thought or how i felt i decided i will not go back to him and i stopped taking it for me its been several months and i feel much better i am trying to lose the 35 pounds i have gained in that time my question is how to deal with menopause with no hormones its coming fast i am 50 this year thanks for the advice my hot flushes had diminished over the past two weeks been using sage tablets starflower oil chillow pillow minerals and acupuncture and either one or all or none of them has worked and just my body recovering from chemo i started tamoxifen a week ago and the flushes are now back with a vengeance and i am demoralised all over again not prepared to stick this for the next five years rather take my chances with a highly er pr sensitive breast cancer than live like this i will try to talk to the onc although i see him for another two months or so it does appear that really knows anything which is so frustrating thanks helen tsundermann like you i will get getting my implants first april 25 and then radiation mid to late may my onc said she would recommend for me not to start tamoxifen until i am done with radiation that way they will know if i have an ses if it is from rads or tamox also i am in chemopause so she did not think it there was a rush for me to start tamox sciencegirl i have been doing acupuncture on and off for a couple of years i started again as soon as i was dx with bc going in about every two weeks my insurance cover it so i only go when i thought i needed something extra to help me deal with this i think acupuncture has helped me deal with the stress i took a break after my bmx as i was having issues with chemo i went back again i personally think it has helped me especially when i started in with the taxol i have had no signs of neuropathy and after a acupuncture treatment my hot flashes really subside also when i had issues with my liver enzymes they went back down really quick this could be do to other things also but in the end after each treatment i felt really good energized and that i was winning the battle if it is all in my head that is fine what ever works hi guys i had taxotere carbo yesterday had taxotere before but they dropped the benadryl this time no steroids had dex in the along with kyrtil and no neulasta things have changed in five years of course five years ago i also had the nasty allergic reax but have it yesterday tg sure as fast as the halaven tho onc had actually floated a study with imtelstat a first in class drug that inhibits telomerase with taxol but it was a randomized study so if i get the study drug and sure i wanted to all i got was a dose of taxol which i have had already since mets so wound up with my suggestion taxo carbo i love it when we direct our own treatment actually my ideas usually work out ok hoping this does wonders elizaeth going to try the ice thing next time and jan your theraspheres treatment really interests me my tumors lend themselves to the surgery unfortunately thank you all for being here been a strange and scary week sharing your support and your experiences but i got my nail hardener on got my for neuropathy only have half an inch of sparse hair so it be much loss so ready to do this and i have to do this and drag myself to the office and what my onc said when i told him about why i opted out of the trial that this new drug seems to be having good results altho he says just phase 1 that since a new approach he thinks the fda might ok it in a year or so optimistic i think but the most important thing he said was this basically that he believes be around to get it after it comes on the market so optimistic for me too and that felt good sorry to ramble on blame it on the steroids paula hi ladies i posted about a week or two weeks ago as first time those who are new here welcome i am still new here so i will introduce myself again i am 33 years old very young but not youngest no kids have a wonderful husband for 10 years and have a adorable dog i was dx on 13 and went lumpectomy and sentinel lymph nodes biopsy on dec 16 2013 all margins and lymph 2 came back all negative and i am stage 1 yesterday was my first ddac chemo day it went very good and much easier than i was thinking about no significant side effect so far at the beginning of chemo i got sodium chloride saline solution a lot for hydration and it helps a lot so very recommended my option for hydration was if i can drink 2l a day or get this saline solution impossible for me to drink 2l so i asked for it then anti nausea medication thru iv plus zofran and compazine before ddac start it took about 1 and a half hr with nurses and pharmacist explain about all the medication and plan for today it was very nice because i have plenty of time to ask all questions i had and curiosity of choice of medications after i took all of them i went bathroom twice at this point then finally adriamycin started it was just about 10 min before i move on to cytoxine i went to bathroom and my urine was already reddish and about 3rd time of bathroom right before i finish cytoxine my urine back to normal i bad at all cytoxine have other side effect that nurse warned me that i may have tension or sensitive nose during infusion i felt some but it bad at all this was my first day of chemo and my husband was with me all the time and one of my friend stop by a min and i had a lots of interaction with nurses and other staffs so i had to focus on many different things that it may help me forget about side effect after 20 hrs passed now and i feel fine i have a minor feeling of nausea but it still under the control the iv for anti nausea is supposed to last for days so it may be helping significantly i hate feeling nauseous anyhow i have minor muscle sore about my body but nothing really a problem i still can do normal daily activities today i will go back to the treatment center and getnuelasta then my mo told me to go bone scan and ct scan for just in case she said i should have nothing there would you ladies done those this is beginning of year and my deductible and out of pocket back on so i have some worries about my financial i had to leave my job because i am working at nursing home as cna my doctor told me the job is too physical and worry about to get seasonal sickness flu and gi track infection which i knew those are always the issue at work and many employees get sick this time of year so i am on fmla leave for 12 wks but my treatment will be longer than that during those 12wks i can keep my insurance without premiums but without job it not easy my husband is full time student now so he is not working either we are already applying for financial assisting and grants and some other services but i am not eligible to be std short term disability from my job benefit and not eligible through social security either at ss we are not poor enough do you ladies have any suggestion for financial support i already applied to relief local ss not eligible at my work not eligible but fmla is good financial assistant program through my hospital thank you marshmellow cream sounds so much easier i will buy some today i had to resort to swallowing it without anything last night because i swallow anything bigger than the actual pill even then it go down at first and i had to take a second sip of water to get it down so far i have been on the drug for 5 days and i have 4 mouth sores they as bad as the ones i got on ac th but they are still painful for me the worst side effect is fatigue and a general feverish feeling until today i actually running a fever but today it was up to until i took motrin how do i tell if the fever is just a side effect so the sign of infection my chest has belt a bit heavy for the past week i have lung mets but it was starting to feel that way before afinitor i also had a mild case of what we think was pneumonia 3 weeks ago i had lung pain and after a round of antibiotics it went away but wheezing continued nothing too bad just annoying i emailed my doctor just to let her know i have a question about this drug how long after you started it did you do your first scan to see if it was working i have been doing pet every 8 weeks but i had a longer break this time due to an insurance gap is this drug considered to be slower acting than a regular chemo i want to scan too quickly and give up on it too quickly i am hoping my body can adjust a little to this drug and that it knocks back my cancer thank you to all of you for keeping this thread going and for paving the way for the rest of us una your daughter is precious ladies here is are a few tips you need at some point in your treatment you may receive neulasta or nepogen sp to increase your white blood cell count this drug causes severe bone pain in many people there is no research on why this works but many recommended this to women on here the combo is claritan the one without the decongestant zantac and a pain reliever not sure if it was tylenol ibuprofen or asprin one of the other sisters will see this and let you know which one there we different recommendations on when exactly to take it i took it the day before the neulasta and then four days after i had no bone pain and pretty amazing for an old woman if you feel queasy eat something small like a couple crackers when i read that tip on here i thought it was nuts but it really does work not one to drink a lot of fluids but during chemo the advice from everyone is to drink drink and then drink some more i was told a minimum of 96 ounces per day during chemo i would brew green tea and ginger and put it into gallon containers the day before chemo and for 3 days after i made sure the container was empty by the end of the day i also want you to know that how chemo affects everyone is different i was 57 when i had my first chemo 12 taxol 4 ac my side effects were minimal i got queasy a few times but never vomited two weeks after my last chemo i celebrated by doing a trapeze swing this is definitely doable ladies horrible she know you were a recovering alcoholic honestly i wonder about people who work in the medical profession sometimes been taking effexor xr mainly for my hot flashes caused by tamoxifen and as kaloni said it works great be a total basket case without it i still have my feelings of anxiety though wanted to get on a wait list for a nursing program but terrified that start school will have racked up student loans and my damn cancer will come back i know i let fear dictate my life but soooo hard blessings to all of you who are suffering emotionally from the aftermath of this damn disease hugs karen hi all i might be a little premature here but i am and as expected a lot of crappy thoughts are running through my head i was diagnosed with ibc in 2008 lymph nodes clear had a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction and tamoxifen but i stopped it after about three years because of side effects that affected my ability to do my job specifically memory loss for example where i would call a coworker and by the time she answered remember what i was calling about having to write everything down just to be able to do the job etc i never had chemo or radiation because i was part of a study that randomized the participants and i was placed into the group that received tamoxifen only i felt fine until a few months ago when i began having bad shoulder and hip pain and mri suggest likely mets or less likely chondrosarcoma or disease i have a pet scan tomorrow and will go from theremy question is if it does turn out to be mets what should i expect as far as pain side effects generally how will i feel for the next few months the reason i ask is because i just spent a buttload of money to get my paralegal certificate and was just about to look for a job do you think i should hold off on that or do you think i will be able to start a new job and perform up to expectations if my prognosis is what i think it is ugh thanks for any input and good luck to you all thanks diana can i just say again how glad i am to be dealing with the hair loss in winter while i can wear all of these cute toboggans a pain to have to be so cautious with cold and flu season out there though become a hermit thank goodness for the internet far to social a person to be home so much pure i have one more ac then start 12 weekly taxol the side effects for taxol list hair loss specifically including eyebrow eyelashes etc hoping be able to bounce back faster with the taxol it certainly was a shorter list of side effects than the other two keeping fingers crossed hi cas i just finished my 3rd round of taxotere aka docetaxol yesterday my protocol is called tc because i also get cyclophosamide at the same time i lost most of my hair and just buzzed it down to stubble i have not had any problems with veins or vein pain my blood counts have been normal each time maybe it helps that i get a neulasta shot the day after treatment i am good the day of infusion but start to crash the next day this involves bone pain i take pain meds aleve and tramadol for that feeling exhausted a few spells of mild nausea and it feels like my legs are filled with sand i also have had a mild headache that can go on and on aleve helps me with that mainly i sleep a lot i can sleep all day for one or two days after treatment and sleep at night too my doc prescribed a sleep medication lorazapam and it works great i only need it for about 4 or 5 nights after my chemo each time i know for sure but compared to the awful side effects that put some of the girls from our thread in the hospital i think the docetaxol might seem easier that what you have been on so basically i have the tc every 3 weeks for a total of 4 treatments and in my case i feel pretty crappy for about 5 days after treatment mostly exhausted no energy and then i feel pretty good for the next two weeks i hope yours goes well vickyni truly believe that some docs and nurses try to act like they know the eye issues surrounding chemo tamoxifen i really have any problems with my eyes during chemo but tamoxifen was definitely my culprit i have been off of the tamoxifen taking a holiday so the oncologist says for almost 2 weeks and my eyes are great i like you had thought i had pink eye a bad infection something wrong because there was a lot of gooey matter in my eyes they were crusty in the mornings i see and thought i was actually going blind i spent over 700 on eye exams new glasses and gels drops etc i started cruising the internet regarding tamoxifen and eye problems there has been proven research back to 1978 that tamoxifen can cause ocular toxicity when i tried to present that info to my ophthalmologist she was too busy to read it and told me to leave the info when i spoke to the oncology nurse on the phone she said she had never heard of it she was at the computer and i told her google tamoxifen and ocular toxicity then she tells me wow i know that i asked my oncologist the beginning of june if she knew anything about it and she sort of gave me a weak yes but it probably the problem i contacted the office after finding the literature and was told i could take a tamoxifen holiday to see if my eyes got better they did and i am thinking i really need new glasses but too late now i will not be going back on the tamoxifen or any other onc drug i am now realizing that the tamoxifen was doing more than making me blind my neck and shoulders were always extremely tender to the touch and now they are not i am also losing weight without guessing the tamoxifen was the culprit there as well i had a complete right breast mastectomy with nodes all nodes clear chemo radiation and tamoxifen for 2 years if i get recurring cancer at least i will be enjoying quality of life and that is very important to me i want to live to be old if it means compromising actually living my life i have grandchildren that are young and i want to keep up with them as well as many other things done with the treatment i hope you get your eye problem resolved it went on for months and i was miserable hi ladies first jennliza just wow speechless i mean whaaaaaat what on earth is going on over there i have zero useful advice like idea of tracking if you are up to it but i can only imagine how frustrating this must be i know how frustrating i found my own hospital stays and those were relatively coordinated baffling that one hand has no clue what the other is doing altho should be somewhat clear that you are on iv antibiotics no i mean read the chart people ugh feel free to moan here any day stupid cancer next pink mrsa appearing as folliculitis double ugh sometimes i feel like the petty indignities we all suffer that get me down for me the taxotere rash back with a vengeance sleep for scratching and wake up to bloody bed sheets and holes all over my body and it scars like a b have no clue how to deal with that but will have to wait till tx is all done to even think about it really hope you can clear up the spots soon ugh stupid cancer mumford i am so sorry about your liver numbers as i am sure you know all likelihood is that they come down and you will finish to be end of month but i know the pain of tx delays very well can imagine this is super multiplied as you are looking forward to your last tx i am thinking of you and hoping you can finish on 18th stupid cancer wallegator oh no i can imagine just what that drawing looked like i am struck by how manifest the impact on our loved ones is i am 39 no kids but a very loved dh and he is clearly struggling and quite know what to do he has been wonderful but it hurts me to see him hurt and know i am the cause of the pain so complicated stupid cancer i seem to have finally brought my fever down today no one knows what it was just hoping some infection rear ugly head like mumford i am just ready to be done end of the month if nothing else goes wrong big hug to all july sistersrain i think there are several reasons for our weight gain one is the steroids even tho we only take them around our treatment time they add weight taxotere will make you retain fluid even if it obvious there my onc nurse told me that it unusual to gain up to 20 lbs while on taxotere also since out taste buds are so messed up we tend to eat things that are higher in calories juice instead of water ice cream smoothies instead of oatmeal for breakfast canned fruit etc then of course felt like crap and laid around for up to 6 months with surgeries and chemo that never helps with weight either so depending on how inactive been and how badly been eating weight watchers may or may not help all the weight from steroids and chemo has to resolve itself with time it is good to know that each one of us is not alone with this problem i myself have gained another 3 lbs after finishing chemo gained 23 lbs now not happy i know a lot of it is water weight but it seem to be going away i thought it would after a month frustrating arimidex or not like many i am having a rough time on arimidex with lots of aches and pains weight gain etc despite an active life style with trips to the gym and yoga in addition i also have the trots i have been told this is a usual side effect and should settle else so afflicted i took arimidex for almost 5 years started out on tamoxifen i had some hair thinning at first that stopped after a few weeks and may have been related to stress at the time and not just the arimidex i did get hot flashes but they were only problematic at night and neurontin took care of it i did get joint stiffness and sometimes pain but i found that taking an drug loratadine available over the counter helped a lot with that as did keeping moving with walking it exactly fun but it horrible either i want to repeat what has all ready been all women have side effects many have none there are lots of things that can be done if side effects crop up dear warriors okay my oncologist gave me the green light for another 3 months she said i look great and although my white count was a tiny bit low no surprise been stressed out switched back to vegan which can cause white count to be a bit lower and my white count seems to be at this lower place normally anyway everythiing else was really good i had been worried about hip pain and she confirmed that if it is persistent and gets worse to be looked at mine since intermittent hardly noticeable most times and seems to come when i walk on it depending on what shoes i wear she said not to worry at all my husband got when she gave me a hug and sent us on our way i went in the bathroom and sobbed for about 1 then we went for a run with the dog in the red rocks of sedona and came home putting me on arimidex and taking me off tamoxifen since officially in menopause and she says that arimidex is more effective she said 40 of women have aches and pains and stiffness from it but that 60 of women have no problems heat stretching and glucosamine all work well she said i asked her if bikram yoga was her rx and she said yes because she knows a fanatic about it anyway and haave been for 6 years not excited to swap meds but if it keeps me alive do anything she also said that losing weight is harder b c of meno and not to blame it on tamoxifen darn thank you all i express how relieved i am right now exhausted xxooclaire i will have my second ac today and after two more rounds will start taxol for four cycles i have the chemo every two weeks i have been taking claritin not claritin d to prevent bone pain after neulasta and have not had any pain whatsoever i take it twice day for a week after the neulasta shot i have been told by my hospital dietitian and my med onc to take every day one scoop in my protein smoothie to prevent neuropathy from the taxol already started taking the and will continue during taxol heard from others that it really helps my med onc also recommends b complex every day to prevent neuropathy congrats heartnsoul yay mhp 70 i can totally get why you would feel sad this is such a loooooong journey and when we reach one hurdle there is still another one right there thanks everyone for your support this is day 3 of round 1 of taxol and i will say that i feel like i have the flu the body aches are bizarre its weird that i felt totally fine yesterday but then i wake up today feeling like i have the flu its like night and day its not so much painful as that i just feel achy and my throat feels swollen not sore but swollen ugh hate stacya rackie and eileen how you guys hanging in today my mom called me and said that it is korean thanksgiving i am korean today and that when she woke up she overheard my dad crying while he was praying asking why god had not spared me from pain i kept trying to sound like i was fine but she caught me right when i woke up from a nap so i was super groggy it is nice not to feel the constant nausea from the ac though altho gotta say not a fan of the achy flu feeling yes you can do it i was on 3 weeks of taxol withone week off for 5 months and made it through i did get neuropathy but it went away for the greater part aftertaxol was stopped just sometimes my baby toes are numb no big deal if you do have problems with neuropathy the taxol can be adjusted the aches got me down but i handled them with pain killers i think yourpain management is working my aches stayed the same right through but were the worst at the beginning you will definitely make it through rockym i had cmf so mine only thinned but i hve to admit since i am now on arimidex it is thin on top if it helps to put this into perspective this txtmnt is to get you here to raise that precious little girl and your hair is dead cells honey you are alive your hair will come back beautiful thick and long again mine came back like crazy gangbusters and even changed colors got curlier etc not all over at all sweetie merely a pause and a whole new and beautiful head of hair perhaps take your little one with you and go have some fun getting a very beautiful wig try a color always wanted to try but keep the same style if it makes you feel more normal i ruefully remember just before my 2nd dgnosis i thought to myself i am 55 well at least i have great hair great boobs and nice teeth that all had to take a beating but now i have a gorgeous new boob even better teeth since i treated myself to veneers and my hair is again my crowningglory just like yours will be so please do this to yourself just a pause while you do this to get your health back we cry when all over how women cope whatever you do will be just right for i also had a recurrance while on tamoxifen and like gk2bc0i had 8mm tumor at the three year mark i also did mastectomies chemo again reconstruction and iwas doing arimidex but my joint pain was severe so i was just switched to aromasin my surgeon also thought that there were somecancer left behind from the first cancer and appeared years later because they take that long to show up on a mammo my onc disagrees i agree with my onc my second cancer had completely different components my first cancerrequired me to take herceptinwhile my second did not who knows why this happens sometimes i think the drugs but helping us right but treatment for the second cancer was hard to figure out taking your ovaries out depends on your age i was 38 when this happened to me and my gyn said not to do it because the sudden loss of estrogen wrecks havoc on your body menopause is more severe and can lastfor years so that sold me on keeping my ovaries but if your older or already in menopause this may be a good option so you can avoid theais really your decision and good luck chances are you know what you need to do but your just looking for reassurance worry whatever decision you make will be right for you but let me throw this at you my gyn said do the ais first if horrible you can also get your ovaries removed but if you do it the other way first there is no reversing it i have been lurking on this thread for a while as my onc is getting ready to put me on the shots at the end of june after scans so about the neuropathy i have had it since my chemo six years ago mostly in my feet and ankles i was told if it lasted longer than three months it would be permanent then two different times i was given lyrica which works for some people but not for me it makes me very dopey and the neuropathy remains as it did for my late diabetic neuropathy been on a bunch of the ais femara arimidex aromasin and no new neuropathy it does sound like it may have happened during surgery what anaesthetic did they use and does it have after you talk to the surgeon you might want to talk to a pt but pretty sure they blame it on an ai though god knows they are the cause of a bunch of good luck s good afternoon well today i was due to start my taxol but my trial drug was not ordered in error so i have to wait until friday apparently the pharmacist read the trial protocolwrong realize it had to be ordered after i finished the ac portionof my treatment my rbc and hemoglobins dropped again which explains my complete exhaustion but the good side is that finally dropped low enough that my insurance will allow me to get the procrit shot procrit helps increase rbc production in the bone marrow and hopefully within a few weeks start to regain some energy janet my mouth sores actually started in my throat and moved to the back of my mouth however i had mouth sores in a while but still am sensitive to spices carbonated soft drinks and such i did suck on ice chips the entire time they did the ac push donna i was talking to the dr today about finishing the ac and starting taxol iam having anxiety because i know the routine of how feel with the ac as bad as been and am afraid of starting something new i am a triple negative and from been toldher medications offer benefits to tnbc patients you may want to research it more or put the question on the triple neg board there are a lot of women on that site that may be able to help you and i just have to say i wait for this crap to be over with unklez i am in the trial you posted information on and did talk to the doctor today about it thank you for the information i was glad to have been informed about it before they pulled out their paperwork i elected to stay in it because i am past ac treatment mixed with the trial drug which iswhat they are reviewing and all of my heart scans and function test came back fine no changes from my initial testing done before chemo i am a little worried and am still doing to do some more research because i can of course still elect to drop out if i feel uncomfortable about it yoyo i getting ready to starttaxol and i sure hope i have the se with the feet and hands it sounds painful so glad you had yourmom helping out it does give us a sense of relief that someone else is there to take over mymom and mil havebeen wonderful well my daughter is home from school and i want tovisit see how her day was hope everyone has a wonderful afternoon been on tamoxifen for a year now started with hip joint pain in october so bad sometimes it wakes me up at night from a deep sleep difficult to get up out of bed in the morning or if been on a long car ride tough to get out of the car always been one to walk or hike over the last many years decade or so i walk about 3 miles every morning so not like been sitting around but this easing up or going away from time to time my knee joints have the same deep intense ache as well as lower back but the hips are definitely the worst if anyone has medical found articles published regarding findings that tamox does cause joint pain could you share the link here love to take a copy to my dr for my next visit thanks hello to everyone 2 years since my mast reconstruction had chemo act first month off then surgery free flap tram flap then 2 months later began radiation have been ontamoxifen daily andlupron shot every month for the last 19 months having oophorectomy in 2 weeks to eliminate shots oh also have implants added after a year due to radiation flattening my tram side anyone on lupron wondering if the 40 lbs i gained is normal could have used this weight for the flaps lol still dancing and enjoying every moment my warm regards to everyone cat log in to post a reply hi everyone really busy today trying to get tim situated and on the road as he starts a new job in kentucky on wednesday amazed at all you ladies who were able to tolerate tamoxifen and the i only lasted one week on arimidex and six weeks on tamoxifen that shit made me so sick enjoyful i am so sorry about your hair loss i did some reading on tykerb and alopecia is listed as a side effect in 13 of the women who are taking mg a day apparently that is the highest dosage hair loss listed as a side effect in doses lower than that it really sucks that your hair is coming bren i took tamoxifen for 26 months part of why i stopped taking it was due to lingering ill effects that i first thought were from chemo or rads but 2 years later i wondered if it be the tamoxifen my top complaints at the time were hot flashes fatigue and nausea hot flashes were the only side effect that disappeared from discontinuing the tamoxifen that was nearly 2 years ago and i finally began to realize that my primary care physician was not up to date on thyroid issues and not sure anyone in my community is been on a self help learning curve ever since i recommend you start learning about iodine an active iodine thread in this section and find links to other information where you can learn more so good to hear from many of you and see where you are now praise god for healing and seeing us through it all i had my last herceptin dec 2 port came out dec 5 i had a hysterectomy oopherectomy in october the tamoxifen already caused problems with my uterus my endometrial lining was 4x thicker than normal and i had 2 very large ovarian cysts that did not resolve after 8 weeks of watchful waiting my cancer was estrogen positive so losing the ovaries was therapeutic to prevent recurrence too if you all could send some prayers positive thoughts good vibes my way i would greatly appreciate it i was in the er friday night for bad abdominal pain they did an abdominal pelvic ct scan and unrelated to the stomach pain they found 2 lesions on my pelvic bone one is a cm ovoid heterogenous mass the er doc said it was suspicious especially considering my history of bc so he told me to follow up with my oncologist first thing monday for a bone scan and or mri just praying not mets this is the part of being a cancer survivor never get used abnormalities in my body and not instantly freaking out so glad all been able to meet on this journey and support one another it truly makes me happy to hear how everyone is slowly getting back to normal and living life again annfromatlantai am also in a tdm 1 trial although had a number of side effects aching sore muscles dry mouth mouth sores sniffles fatigue i have not had major trouble with nausea just a tiny bit unsettled on days 1 2 and have taken no meds i get nauseous easily and had lots of trouble with it during ac but none with tdm 1 interested that they warned you that you would be puking your guts out my doctors assured me that nausea would not be a major issue i hope round goes better for you omg everyone has to take time off for being sick from chemo i worked through chemo but was up to a week off post when it finally ended taxol is not a breeze to have and please do not think that it is also call your office to get some zofran to help with the nausea some onc prescribe compizine and that makes you more tired then you already are if you feet anre going numb tell them because taxol can cause neuropathy and that can be treated with gabapetin expect too much of your self at home either the house work can wait it will still be there for you if someone ask what they can do maybe prepare meals housework i had 4 rounds a c and just finishing my 3rd round of taxol i only have one left i am finding taxol to be easier first 2 days i wonder if they did anything to me at all but days 3 and 4 are harder cos of the bone pain and tiredness i have a neulasta shot the day after chemo which also causes bone pain so that might make the bone pain worse i also notice that i get weepy on days 3 and 4 possibly because i feel well as far as hair i lost mine after 2nd a c but kept my lashes til the taxol now they are almost gone i bought false eyelashes and trying them out this week a pain literally but feeling so much happier knowing i only have one of these left there is light at the end of the tunnel good luck yes it does go away as soon as the nasal hairs return remember both the runny nose and the nasal hairs act as filters to help you get rid of bacteria and stuff without the hairs you naturally produce more mucus and with me it took close to 3 months for the hairs to return and the nose to stop running after 3xfec 3xtax but i do find still that my nose runs quite a bit more than it used to when eating hot food elisabethi was wondering about the depression of arimidex i am also in otherwise good health did fine with six rounds tch surgery a breeze traveled worked felt generally optimistic now 4 months after arimidex severe hip pain severe depression i decide if the depression in arimidex or post traumatic stress disoder i cry and cry feel generally negative chemo put me into menopause early i am 43 and just know the have prescribed effexor but i feel that is just another pill i am on herceptin arimidex and the bisphos trial too not to mention all of the supplements please everyone weigh in i would love to hear from all of you on arimidex and your experiences hello all i have finally gathered the courage to stop lurking and finally post the bainbridge girls all know me funny how i am even more shy online than in person just to introduce myself i had two primary cancers in one breast one er pr her one triple negative bilateral mastectomy micro met full lymph node dissection on the right side i finished tc in january and had a hell of a trial on tamoxifen fevers and nausea for 6 months the three shots of lupron that was unbearable no sleep at all in between horrid hot flashes and am now taking a supervised break know what is next i have an appt with a gyn at swedish to discuss a full hysterectomy in a couple of weeks bounced around to a few oncologists and finally found a good fit i have 2 teenage boys 9th and 12th grade and a fisherman husband i am just so comforted with connecting with you all out there i do need the support i am considered premenopausal 45 stopped my period twice such fun once during chemo and now after lupron have a feeling it will come back again hence the talk of hysterectomy anyone out there that has exhausted the tamoxifen and lupron i just want to be back especially for my boys they are about to fly the coop christl hi feelingthe magic i am so thrilled to hear the stronger steroids have helped with the side effects of doctaxel taxotere i also seem to be highly allergic to the stuff and have had some horrible side effects the worst being the excruciating joint pain i must admit i was rather dreading the 3rd one as allergic reactions quite often get worse and not better with other drugs thought i would pass this tip along to all you lovely ladies in case you have also experienced this problem i found my scalp was feeling really sore it even hurt to move my head on the pillow i read somewhere about sweet almond oil i put some on and let it soak in for a few hours and then washed the few wisps of hair that are left and guess what it feels better already cheryl i have been where you are several times over the past few months one time was during treatment i had finished 4 taxotere i shared with my doctor how tired i was and what a hard time i was having i work all day i would make dinner at night and literally crash in bed for the rest of the night only to start it all over again then depression came my oncologist lowered the dose of my next 2 treatments i was still tired and such but mentally i think it helped not being knocked down with the count of 10 because we are metsers there is no light at the end of the tunnel sure we get breaks or switch therapies but in truth there is no end to just make it through treatment we have that to look forward to like we did before two weeks ago i went through a horrid horrid bout of sadness i was recovering from surgery the stomach virus was hitting our household one morning i want to get out of bed i just want to face the day i either called in sick for the boys or school was canceled they were down stairs and i just hung out in bed crying i literally had to pull myself out of bed and do something anything no matter how bad i felt i cleaned the kitchen sounds silly that was round 1 round 2 i was all alone at home overwhelming sadness hit we too are buried in snow i really been out of the house except for dr appointments or the grocery store i actually had a screaming crying fest for about 15 minutes you know the kind of cry that you just scream omgosh was that cleansing i needed to get it out i needed to feel sorry forr myself and just scream the crap out of it this crap fricking stinks and i refuse to be cancer girlwith a good attitude cause attitude helpwhen you are so fricking tired all you can do is lay there i say have a good scream or sob fest then do something totally indulgent eat something totally fattening watch or read something that is so funny or stupid that it makes you smile or take a good long nap then say tomorrow is a new day it about the attitude but about hope see if you can lower the dose and get a bit of energy back with out quality of life treatment sucks too much out of us hang in janis had my first of 12 taxol treatment on friday 28 i wrote out this whole long post yesterday but left it in preview and navigated away from the website so it never posted here i am trying again thursday night i was directed to take 1 over the counter benedryl 25mg 1 xantac max 150mg and 12mg of decadron 3 pills i slept fine and my appointment was at 10am i had some blood drawn friday morning then saw the doctor who assured me that these treatments be as horrible as a c i had been participating in a clinical trial with avastin but dropped out because a c was so hard on me that i no longer wanted to put anything in my body that did not absolutely have to be there after dropping out of the study i learned from the research nurse and another oncologist that people who receive the avastin during the study always report worse ses that is a little tidbit that i would have liked to have known prior to entering into the study but the water has long since flowed under that bridge taxol infusion was 90 minutes compared to my usual 3 hour a c infusion and i felt fine a little sleepy from the additional benedryl that was administered via the iv but other than that nothing friday night i slept well saturday we had our usual weekend routine with no injection interruptions on a c i had to return to the hospital every day for 8 days to receive a neupergin shot sunday afternoon i started getting a little sleepy and feeling some fatigue i fight it so i napped off and on through the afternoon and into the evening monday i came to work first time since starting chemo that i was actually able to work after chemo i stay the whole day because i was getting very tired but i did stay until a bit after 1pm and then went home and napped i did not feel nauseaus at all from the taxol i did throw up yesterday but that was because i took too many vitamins and not enough food for breakfast my fault been taking 100mgs of b6 and 60mgs of zinc daily along with my i also take a perscription nexium daily to combat the heartburn that the steriods cause ask your doctors about doing the same wait for issues to become a problem like the heartburn and the neuropathy before you address them i am so happy that the ses been bad and i did not have to have a neulasta shot this first and i hope that continues my hair growing back yet but the peach fuzz i never lost has started to get a bit longer maybe that is a sign that the rest of it may start poking through any day i tell you how often i stare into the mirror almost willing the hair follicles to grow dammit so sick of being bald i just want enough coverage to feel confident going out of the house without my scarves i have a wig that i worn even once been so hot here this summer and the wig is terribly itchy and hot my fingernails have started doing really peculiar things but someone who traveled this road before us suggested cutting the painful nails down as short as you can and that has helped not sure what can be done about the bumps in the nail bed or the digs and ridges i much care about it being unsightly as long as it hurt just finished up my 5 years of tamox about 4 months ago i tolerated it pretty well with relatively mild hot flashes and insomnia some the way i look at it i probably had similar issues with natural menopause anyway which i was nearing i was 46 when i started taking it and i wanted to be proactive in trying to prevent an invasive bc in my future i am high risk from lcis and family history i had any further bc problems so for me it has worked well my mom took it years ago had ilc lumpectomy and rads and is now a survivor of over 22 years without a recurrence so that had a lot to do with my decision making too i did end up with immediate surgical menopause lost by cysts my oncologist feels any ses i have are more due to the depletion of estrogen from the loss of the ovaries not the tamox anne paxton hope the mouthwash works quickly welcome tuck and patricia and kim sorry but welcome cleob no se i am but get on that later when my hair goes my husband offered to shave but he already has a receding hair line so afraid it grow back and told him no ok 3rd treatment of taxol is in about 8 hours se so far nausea taste changes constipation runny nose and fatigue usually feel better around day 4 after treatment but i am still working so probably more rest would help with some of the se just one more week of work then the family is off for vacation ctherese made me lol sounds like you are handling it well can i come cry on your shoulder when mine falls out fotopet ugh sacphotomom i am going also but i get into the class until july really need it by then too be on vacation for the one in june so hope i can wait redbarb hope your concert was fun today yesterday hello there my name is lynda and i have been taking tamoxifen now for about 4 weeks i havnt noticed any weight gain what i have noticed though that the hot sweats have stopped for the time being i had more of the hot sweats whilst i was having chemo and radiation is there anymore side effects that i may need to know about also is there any of you ladies suffering with lymphodema mke glad to hear your report from a year out i finished chemo in april and lost three toenails soon after i finished taxol over half of my fingernails are looking like going to go also i just keep telling myself that in a year be back so thanks for reinforcing that idea only nails after all survival is much more important my taxotere se have not been too bad mostly fatigue iam having some mild nuerapathy some pain in my nail beds and ichy hands but i have met a woman who got really bad nueapathy and having finished treatment is still using a walker for long distance and a cane for short distance and the numbness in the tips of her fingers is still there she expects to be done with the walker in a few months she still has trouble with turns every medicine has possible side effects we weight the pros and cons and roll the dice much like life i made an appointment for a reikie session on tuesday night it should at the very least be interesting i am learnng so much about the none physical parts of myself as i travel this most interesting journey remember the old chinese curse may you live an interesting life i have spent the day resting dh has the day off and he took ds swimming and to school picked up the food for dinner and prepped it i have eatten showered watched a wee bit of tv and mostly read in bed my important calls can wait till monday thanks for the joke bev i have a couple to share later but they are not quite as on point but laughter is one the best meds so lets share away oh no more bad news had my first ct scan after just three treatments of abraxane the chemo has not worked at all except to give me neuropathy new spots in the liver too many to count was expecting the treatment today but doc is taking a week out to consider new treatment for me or possibility of a trial so disappointed everything was pointing to the treatment working and they just explain to me why this has happened in effect had no treatment at all and tumours are just continuing to grow may move on to gemcitabine and carboplatin but at the moment just thinking if abraxane work whose to say anything will docs had such high hopes for it therefore so did i continue to feel well physically but very down in my head need some words of wisdom encouragement from you lovely ladies please the title of this thread is a misnomer because there is no life on aromasin i am having really bad joint pain to the point where i function i am going to try hard to stick it out until 90 days cause my mo said that is how long it usually takes for the body to adjust but i am doubtful i will make it that long before i ask to be switched she said tamoxifen would be next for me she does not like femara or arimidex for dcis so i really want aromasin to work for me cause i feel comfortable taking tamoxifen with my history of dvt and ugh it is so wonderful to hear about some women doing well on this drug i wish it were me i had the same chemo regimen as you did and i also worked through it no i as productive but i liked the fact that it kept my mind off of cancer i felt more energetic on taxol than ac though taxol gave me mild diarrhea i also felt more on taxol which is important to me because i teach even though i had my last chemo infusion on december 3 i feel normal as getting ready for surgery and rads not sure i will ever go back to the old normal but will have to adjust to a new normal i do try to do some of the same things like swimming and scootering with my kids but pretty slow and take things easy hi everyone dawn and cyndi be here a while too i am doing the weekly taxol and herceptin and will be receiving the herceptin until next july i just received tx 4 today anna my only problem with the taxol is a gi problem too live without the imodium i just had a stool sample tested to be sure i have something else going on and it came back negative so i guess i just keep the imodium with me at all times and pray it does the job i started back to work last week since the taxol affect my concentration so much i work as a court reporter and i miss a word when in a deposition with ac there was no way to concentrate for any length of time but last thursday i did fine not going to be working as much as i used to just start slowly but i really think this taxol herceptin will allow me to get back to it as long as i get the neuropathy in my fingers that may cause a few problems for me anyway it just feels good to do something i had to give up for a while i just want to feel normal again garnet ann with you as far as the hair thing i want to toss all my hats and my wig asap my hair is starting to grow with the taxol it is patchy and growing slowly i took a ruler to measure it as it sticks straight up i swear it is inch but when i told my family how long i think it is they laughed maybe only inch but it is definitely growing i even have to shave my legs again oh yeah and facial hair is back i hate it but in a way i was happy to see it these steroids are horrible on the night of treatment i never sleep seems silly to even go to bed but i guess give it a try best wishes to all xoxo kathleen ed2012 when i was diagnosed with adh 14 years ago at 35 no one offered tamoxifen i was told to just get my yearly mammos well that work out for me i had yearly digital mammos had ultrasounds saw a breast surgeon yearly and the gyno yearly and after 12 years i was diagnosed with cancer that was never seen on the mammo only then did my oncologist tell me that tamoxifen could have helped me prevent getting cancer if i knew then what i know now i would have taken the tamoxifen in light of my surveillance woes i chose to have a bmx instead of the recommended lumpectomy radiation because i feel that mammos and us work on me i started tamoxifen in december and really point to any se i do get hot flashes but that started during chemo so i am unsure if the tamoxifen is the culprit i lost weight and i have tried but i also gained weight my knees get achey when i stand after sitting but my knees have always had issues i do go to spin class and zumba and have no trouble so perhaps my knees are just being 49 and having a history of lots of tennis that put me in pt when i was much younger all i can say is that it is a personal decision but ask yourself how you would feel if you could do something to prevent cancer do it and then got cancer cancer sucks chemo sucks being bald sucks i forever have the big c hanging over me not fun hi all i love all the hair pictures so much everyone looks so amazing love the colors too it will be interesting to see my natural color i am on 7 of 12 taxol and see my hair starting to show a little itchy is this normal i still have no eyebrows and eyelashes though i too am a cat person my simba is 19 years old he has be so lovey and attached to me these past 5 months love him so much i will try posting a picture of me taken last week if it is too big i know lago will help me out liberty nope had a chance to look for your sister yet re hot flash triggers i did a menopause support group for several years so have had some experience in explaining and counseling on this issue it is thought that estrogen helps regulate the thermostat so with decreasing or in our case eliminating estrogen causes the autonomic nervous system ans to overshoot as it attempts to regulate as you might recall from hs biology class the ans regulates all the body functions we have to think about including breathing many things can effect and stimulate the ans and trigger hot flash hf including stress alcohol spicy foods some people find that doing paced respirations or yoga breathing can calm down the ans to reduce hf with practice i have had some luck with this this also works with overactive bladder there is also some evidence that acupuncture is helpful for hf as well i have not tried this but may consider this if my hf get any worse i have had hf for over 10 years but they have been manageable and were almost gone before i started anastrozole 3 mo ago last night was terrible i woke up soaked in sweat i am hoping this was from my recent reclast infusion and will subside we shall see ps studies have indeed shown that women with more severe hf during menopause do have a lower risk of bc but what is to be done about that dear cathy sure everything will be alright gotten you this far if it were me and if breast cancer was er be asking the doc for a hysterectomy take it all ovaries and everything i know that may sound a bit radical but once out no more periods and nothing left to worry about my hys was the best thing i ever did your md can tell how well the tamoxifen is working by getting some blood tests fh fsh lh this lets you know if the tamoxifen has put you in a menopausal state the same thing happened to me i was on tam for 1 year then started to break through they wanted to give me shots but i said no and opted for the surgery not for everyone but gives you something else to think about best of luck and god bless tbyrd bjham i think important to get a baseline dexa bone density test when starting ai treatment i believe standard procedure for many cancer centers are known to reduce bone density and that can lead to osteoporosis or fractures some menopausal women at high risk for osteoporosis have to take tamoxifen for that reason if i were you just request one from either your onc or gp how else will you know if the drug is causing rapid changes thanks everyone on the input concerning the nasty taste i will try the cranberry juice i read somewhere that if you drank a little of fruit juice before you ate it would wake up your taste buds and food all taste like cardboard the only thing that i have found lately that has actually tasted good was ceasar salad so guess what i eat kimbe i did the taxol 12 weeks and it was not bad at all i felt tired sometimes but i have any nausea hope it goes well for you thanks again wow sounds like we are doing well great sarah hope that heals and you can move to the next step these wounds can be brutal sometimes i had one that took a while as well not fun lisa i would be afraid to shave it even though been through this and know it comes back just would be so happy to see hair anne you might keep your new hair on taxol fingers crossed karen glad to hear not serious and i love the picture i had a lot of weird pain after my mast and it did end up being the nerves and i did recover feeling when it was first done my underarm was completely numb down to my elbow i had pains for what seemed like months sharp ones too and after a while all the sensation came back there now only a small patch on the back of the arm hope the case for you as well but you know your body and should do what you think is best sounds like a good idea to get the girls matched up and 50 you look fabulous cindy smiley faces are a good thing glad the radiation is going well for you although i imagine walking two miles every day good for you i know exactly what you mean about what if it i had a similar revelation a couple of months ago what if i survive this i had spent so much time mourning my life that i never thought about living through it after a while on this board i realized that i can and needed to get back to living it has been much easier to go through it with that end in mind i feel so much happier now and like you waste time on less meaningful things erica so happy to hear your surgery went well a big relief for all of us to hear sure good luck on the mast in a couple weeks it will be good to get that behind you as well as for me now four weeks post chemo and 2 weeks into hormone therapy my hair is still white fuzz but feels a bit longer to me the remaining hair from before is now falling out eyebrows and eyelashes all six of them are also falling out taking that as a sign that new ones are growing since been there for 5 months i had to pluck the chin hairs although they were pale several eyelashes and eyebrows poking through yay yes we are easy to please i cannot believe that even in my situation i really just want my hair back the hormones seem good so far had some joint pain at first but that has subsided i did hit my top limit in weight at the last onc visit but then again i spent three weeks eating cookies and fudge and oh so decadant holiday snacks spent the last couple of weeks watching more and hope to get back in the middle of my range i hear the hormones may cause gain so i want to keep on top of it since i do not want to buy a new wardrobe it is nice to feel better it took a week or so but man i feel so much better more energy stomach is better more positive outlook such a nice change after all the crap hope you all continue to move forward in your recoveries hugs ginney warriorprincess 24 i just finished dd taxol on wed i did not have problems with neuropathy but do have hot flashes am officially in chemopause know if this will help or not but since i started chemo back in january i have been taking 50mg of b6 and b12 twice a day along with powder 5mg twice a day also i did take more of the when i started the taxol regime because i was so afraid of neuropathy but had issues with high liver enzymes so i decreased it i also do acupuncture every two weeks i will continue with this for several months because i read that taxol can still effect you several months after finishing and my oncologist said that it was fine just need to clear it with the ro i think the acupuncture really helped me with the hot flashes still get them but they have not as bad it might have also helped with the neuropathy i never did the ice bags during transfusion as utmom suggested but i have heard from several people that it really helped them so definitely give it a try with your next infusion also with taxol i took vicodin on days because of joint pains am on it now since it is day 4 for me hopefully i am making sense with what i am writing since i am under the influence good luck and i am sending you hugs hi el kat did you get flushes with the chemo i had flushes all through fec and tax and then the five weeks wait to surgery and then of course ever since dear old leprechaun tam came into my life for a while i found i was getting period pain but no periods a decade older than you ancient but family hisotry suggests a decade off natural menopause as well as flushes i tried the naked under a thin duvet for a while bet not many vicars tell you that and often ended up with arms and legs stuck out at right angles looking like an oversized pink dog have you tried a fan i stand the whirring keeps me awake but others find it helps jengoll the neulasta shot contains a hormone like product granulocyte factor that some immature white blood cells neutrophils need to mature and be released from the bone marrow since our bone marrow cells get zapped by the chemo the neulasta shot the marrow to make it begin producing wbc again heard the bone pain comes from the fact that lots of neutrophils are crowding in the outer layer of bone the periosteum all trying to get out into the blood at the same time like beachmom lee i am also on taxotere cytoxan and i automatically get a neulasta shot with each chemo treatment the tc combination causes just as much bone marrow suppression as ac does apparently i think taxotere alone causes that problem although you are right in pointing out that taxotere causes bone and muscle pain sometimes hard to tell why it the taxotere or is it the neulasta the neulasta injection must be given subcutaneously some of us get it in our upper arm others get it under the skin fat in the abdomen it cannot be given through a port because that would be i v hope that helps otter i would like to add my two cents in since this topic is of interest to me i was on actonel for five years before being diagnosed with bc my gp at that time told me i am losing bone density and need it did not request the actual dexa reports until last year found out i was slightly osteopenic so probably should not have been put on actonel but the dexa test right before i started arimidex was normal so it is possible that it was the actonel that reversed it now after being on an ai for a year i have osteopenia again and the onco wanted to put me on reclast reclast is used for osteoporosis and zometa is the same drug but different dose used for bone mets i have an appointment with an endocrinologist next week to get her opinion and see what else can be contributing to my bone loss thyroid could be one i am not planning to go on any of the bone building drugs at this time if i can help it fearless why not ask to go on tamoxifin instead of an ai i am going to discuss this with my onco i know she will fight it my hair is starting to thin out on the ai hi there i had fec for 6 rounds 5 weeks of rads and have been for 3 years on tamoxifen my leg pain started hand in hand with my last chemo and the start of tamoxifen i call it the weird pain syndrom as it just make any sense my feet hurt all the time whether i walk on them or not sitting make it any better i have butterflies in my calfs and it seems they always burn especially at night time i have a sharp pain in my right calf and we did a veinogram spl to make sure it a blood clot my achilles is always sore my big toes are somewhat numb i have weird muscle pain in my upper arms as well as some bone pain some of it i know is arthritis but the weird stuff is the tamoxifen this summer the cancer centre here has change the supplier manufacturer of the drug and since then my life has been more or less hellish the side effects are just so incredible strong it took me a while to figure it out that it is the new drug that is causing the problems my onc recommended to stop tamoxifen for about a week to see whether the side effects go away they got better but i only stopped for 5 days i will have to go back and ask for the old drug if at all possible i sure hope they can as the thought of taking tamoxifen for another 2 year is just horrible i have my annual exam scheduled for next week with my physician and there will be lots to talk trust me i know some of us have really bad side effects on tamoxifen or any other drug but up until now my side effects were annoying but tolerable i want anyone to think that they give this drug a try after all these drugs are there to safe our lives so i hope you will find out what is causing your symptoms if they persist talk to your doctor christine i have been on femera for 2 months and have minimal side effects other than the joint pain and ocassional foot pain i alsohave been taking glucosamine with chronroitin as well for about 3 months and it really helps i also where orthodics in my shoes and can really tell a difference if i where shoes that do not have them in i have fewer side effects on femera than i did on tamoxifen ifi over do it on a given dayi will take analeve and that has been able to take care of any pain i have had jill hi all thanks for the eye info i wear glasses for computer work been to my ophthalmologist since i started treatment guess i should go get checked asap eleven weeks pfc today and 2 weeks post rads i was starting to feel better more energetic less irritable at the end of last week and over the weekend but today marginal started tamoxifen last friday and i think that is the cause i am a bit short of breath and my dreams are waking me up at night so i am tired way different feeling than the fatigue which has subsided my acupuncturist told me that vivid dreams are a side effect of tamoxifen have not researched this but boy have i had some doozies the last couple of nights no nightmares but i wake up really believing my dream took place in real life so weird my skin is almost totally cleared up it was crackling and painful the last week of radiation and the first week post rads i did not get blisters for those worrying about recovery weird being done with treatment i have a doctors appt for another month my center has a survivorship program to help adjust to all of the issues we will have post treatment medical and otherwise check with yours or maybe some of the support groups can offer advice canuck i think it was you who mentioned for every month in treatment we need 2 for recovery which puts me maybe back to normal around this time next year this seems superficial but i think i would feel less sickly if i had my hair back cheers to all of us i did not qualify for the parp trials in southern cal so onc put me on the combo i would have gotten had i been in your situation accepted but not in the parp arm currently on cisplatin and gemzar it is apretty easy chemo combination and i think cisplatin is a bit tougher than carboplatin so you should be good tiny bit of hair thinning but no hair loss slight nausea and tiredness but very few problems with taste buds neuropathy etc best of luck to you and hoping a winning combination for us both hi everyone i just wanted to post that been having acupuncture for hot flushes and they started to fade after the first session i believe it had 3 sessions so far and almost gone 44 taking nolvadex which my gp prescribed after discussions with my onc to reduce the likelihood of ses as allergic to loads of things and my onc recommended the acu sorry i spend more time on here supposed to be working love to all bella xx jasi had 4 cycles of ac lost my hair on day 15 then 4 cycles of taxotere i have any nausea and agree with moodyk 13 that the mouth sores fatigue bone pain and constipation were the worst of it for me i did have a port and i feel for me that was the easiest to deal with during trouble with access no ruining my veins etc having it in did bug me for a few weeks until i got used to it and i wait to get it out after chemo so they removed it during surgery all in all although it certainly fun the chemo experience as horrible as i was expecting it to be jeri hi all sorry about the dental woes i had some crown trouble during chemo my dentist said not uncommon because chemo drugs so often cause decreased saliva he said teeth can be at risk for cavities and crown damage i cracked a molar and was in the chair for four hours during chemo my blood was apparently not clotting normally and he could not get a dry field to apply crown i had a cbc at office hour before and she said it was a go but not so much as it turned out i correctly dx pain swelling and headache as beginning infection and called dentist at home the next evening peroxide topically and antibiotics did the trick in 24 hours yikes what a miserable experience took my mind off of chemo though leesa and calypso so happy called your doctors i know how hard it is but everyone here is ready to help every way we can i had discolored nails for a long time after taxol finally they seem back to normal i have any fall off though i know some people who did have that problem foot neuropathy is very persistent and my eyes water a lot right more than left i had a lot of eye swelling during tx but it is almost gone now so far ned so it was worth it but i remember being depressed about it at the time nancyla your husband sounds like mine with that comment i was dead set against tattoes but my rad onc said he only uses two or three at most i finally consented and i have two one on the middle and the other kind of under the arm my middle one is so small they had to turn the light on each day to find it for the boost they did another simulation and i had blackmagic marker all over me for two weeks tattoes are blue ginny and sabrina not sure if you mind but anyone on internet can read our posts and see your address lauragto is keeping a private and information list for us if like you can send your info to her and she will add you to thelist then automatically get pics and stuff or you can send pm if you wish and your address will stay private have to go outand play in the snow the sun is brilliant and it is warmer here than at home big hugs to everyone pat hi cat i am so sorry to hear that you have recently been diagnosed with extensive bone mets this must be a difficult time for you please know that you have come to the right place for support and input i have been living with bone mets for over a year now and am feeling so much better than i once was bone pain can come and go sometimes due to the weather temporary side effects of hormonals and even due to healing it is hard to say whether the pain is a result of new bone mets this is an important issue to discuss with your doc i was initially on tamoxifen after my initial diagnosis five years ago i absolutely hated this drug and was not always consistent in taking it when bone mets were diagnosed i began taking lupron aromasin and zometa after 7 months i had my ovaries out for me the lupron seemed to make the bone pain worse maybe you might want to discuss with your doc the side effects of lupron bones do take a long time to heal zometa is a wonderful drug for many but it still takes a while for the bones to begin to recover hang in there it will get better many wishes for more comfort are being sent your way i been here for awhile as some may recall this is my second time with bc and second time with chemo separated by 4 years i was on t c since what i had previously with few not so this time round 1 developed hives it was the last day of the olympics by pm we were off to the er after a few hours of iv steroids etc everything went away but what misery beforehand for round 2 my onc removed the one thing different from before neulasta hives returned but i had all the meds to deal with it and they spread beyond scalp and neck three or four days later started running temps of 103 off to the er again this time my blood counts were so low they admitted me had massive doses of antibiotics and 2 units of blood onc said i had developed an allergy to taxotere and could not have it again so now am on a c plus neulasta which i got five days ago round 3 so far are utter fatigue no appetite and when i eat everything tastes like cod liver oil hard to force myself to eat anything so been a little rougher this time but my last round will be oct 3 and i cannot wait to start feeling more like myself again i cannot wait for a martini and raw oysters i cannot wait to have my nails grow longer i cannot wait to wear my skinny jeans i kind of like not having hair though anywhere to you all hi debs i was diagnosed like you in july 2010 with grade 3 idc er pr because of the size of the lump and the fact that not a big chested lady i had a mastectomy and limphnode clearance followed by ec tax like you i remember a succession of bad news everytime i saw the consultant first the cancer diagnosis then the grade then lymphnodes involvment etc i was literally petrified of going to the hospital but it does get better i have just finished my last tax and waiting to start radiotherapy worry about the tax like julie said the pain is more in the joints and bones just ask the onc for strong painkillers and you will get through it i had no sickness nor nausea at all on the contrary i was always hungry as far as the mx is concerned i thought it was going to be worse than i envisaged but i got through it pretty quickly with no pain at all the only bummer was the arm movement for the first month i also had full node clearance i cannot comment on the recostruction as i am having it done next year are you having yours done at he same time as the mx you will get through this i know how bummed you must be feeling right now but it will get better p s my hair started growing with tax debs x amelie rose lago is mo said the same thing althoughthe pathology may indicatethat there isno vascular invasion no nodes etc which is very good news some women with her 2 still end up with mets over time and they just know why hence chemo and herceptin are our best weapons to eliminate this from happening anafoefana i was anemic throughout tch which added to the fatigue as well as my weird chemo skin color it seems like many of us were anemicand crept close to transfusionsbut ultimately avoided them so it must be will be keeping aclose watch on those labs yaya thanks set many goals both big and small throughout this treatment process to give me something to really look forward to during the difficult times my next one is a trip to paris england to celebrate the completion of chemo and wait wow glad i am not the only one i do have to disagree about it just being the menopause thing because they had me on tamoxifen for 3 years following chemo and no problems weight ws down was still working out pretty normal stuff and i see how it has been cumulative just creeping up on me i know i need to work out but i am just so tired well put that my get up and go has got up and went the dr suggested super b complex for energy but have not seen much difference but then again maybe i am just getting older and am expecting more out of my body at 50 than 45 i know plus my onco said he plans on keeping me on arimidex indefinately because studies are showing the longer the better did i mention that fatigue means no energy for fooling around good thing i have a pretty understanding hubby because it has dwindled down to once or twice a year sad huh so what do you do goes back to that famous quality of life of life i just found this page i had finished chemo radiation about a year and a half ago still dealing with chemo after effects one of the drugs i had was taxotere i wish my oncologist had told me i would be dealing with the fatigue still and now the muscle pain i used to be pretty flexible but now i bend over without pain in my hamstrings i also still get very winded just doing regular yard work the taxotere had caused me to build up fluid in my lungs and lower body when in chemo i had to have the fluid in my lungs drained i still have numb fingers and toes only 48 and feel like 80 most days will i ever get my body back the way it was before chemo hi i was on 4 cycles dd a c and 4 of taxol i have been told that taxol and taxotere are very similar in the side effects my biggest problem was joint pain i learned a regimen of 2000 mg of tylenol for 2 days prior to treatment and days after treatment helped considerably narcotics did not help at all and i tried several neuropathy tingling feels like when your foot falls asleep i had a very minor bit of that in my fingers and toes my taste buds were off quite a bit but that might have been cumulative from all the chemo my nails got discolored i did actually lose my big toenail which was painless and really bother me i have the ugliest toes my skin on the bottom of my feet would peel very painless and i looked at it as the ultimate pedicure what i noticed most was that i felt more normal a c really messed me up i was very tired but clear headed it was also winter so that help i hope this helps keep checking in this is a wonderful resource good luck and remember you are halfway there warrior_womanis great that you were able to loose weight and stay active i have had a similar experience before breast cancer i was the ultimate couch potato no exercise at all i also gained weight during chemo i started exercising the same week i started chemo when i say exercise i mean just walk slowly and not for very long i wore my wig to the gym with no issues since i did not break a sweat after chemo i started taking tamoxifen that was three years ago i continued to exercise and also changed my diet i lost the chemo weight and some i started doing weights and for the first time i feel toned i am 51 years old and i am in far better shape that i was in my 40 s i found that the gym classes work for me because they keep me on track i love bodypump and hitt high intensity interval training the fact that i feel good does not mean i have not had side effects from tamoxifen i have learned to live with hot flashes and vaginal discharge the joint pain has been annoying i can no longer do pushups or dips because my wrists hurt so i do lots of planks tamoxifen affects us in different ways the important thing is to find ways to do those activities or lifestyle changes that can help you i was 47 at diagnosis and was perimenopausal with hot flashes and sexual difficulties already starting i developed persistent knee and neck pains while on tamoxifen and hand and hip pains that came and went as well as stiffness if i stayed in one position too long i also noticed that on long drives i would get an annoying ache in my right buttock i took a couple of short breaks from tamoxifen during the 3 years i was on it neck ache improved with 1st break stiffness surprisingly got even worse for a short while with 2nd break when i quit for good in feb 2011 not much difference in aches i had a period in almost 2 yrs at that point i waited a few months then started aromasin which gave me foot pain that made walking difficult and overall dryness so i quit that after 2 months was afraid it would speed up the overall aging process 53 now been a year and a half since been on any medication and i still get bouts of arthritic type pains in feet that come and go but no longer any hand or hip pain find that i have to be more careful at the gym can pull something much more easily than a few years ago and then the pain from that seems to stay for weeks when i do mile hikes with my walking group or spend the entire work day on my feet i always start to feel some type of foot pain by the end i have kept my lower back limber with yoga and weight maintained with lots of stair climbing and since i recently started using more hand weights and stopped using the treadmill right now nothing aches much of what i was previously feeling could possibly be attributed to the aging process and having gone through menopause while on tamoxifen hard to say which was the culprit things that definitely have improved for sure though are no more right buttock ache on long drives no more neck ache less knee pain going down the stairs less hot flashes and better immunity had some horrible colds and kept getting eye irritations burning and chalazion bumps while on tamoxifen i also agree with turmeric being helpful for reducing aches and pains my onc had suggested it to me welcome to the board lynne i had 12 cycles of taxol and 4 cycles of fec on the taxol i always had a salty taste in my mouth i lived off of unseasoned eggs it was the only thing i could taste i had some nausea but no vomiting i was never tired but all of that came to an end with the fec i had nausea vomiting and fatigue thankfully the neulasta did not cause any joint pain it was not horrible but it pleasant either luckily there are solutions to the side effects i stocked my medicine cabinet with over the counter remedies for mouth sores constipation diarrhea you name it i had it they came in handy so being informed about the potential side effects can help you be prepared to manage them hello annethank you for your post i was so sorry to read that you have been having a difficult time with your boiler and at the hospital these appliances such as boilers are there to bring us hassle and it is absolutely awful when they pack up we are so used to our hot water and central heating our boiler also packed up when i was going through chemotherapy and my husband raymond had to give british gas hell to get them to come out and repair it as an emergency we were paying for their gold service but even so they wanted to take their time raymond said i was ill and that made them move if it is any consolation our packed up when i was going through radiotherapy and travelling to exeter in a heat wave every day what a time you had at the hospital six hours at a hospital is exhausting with reference to the parking you should be able to get a free disabled pass for the duration of your breast cancer treatment the hospiscare nurses arranged all this for me when they first came to see me prior to my treatment they arranged it through the local council and i got it in no time at all it was valid for three years but i returned it when i finished treatment these things should be advertised a patient does not want to be worrying about parking costs when going through treatment with chemotherapy there is no knowing how long you are going to be at the hospital it is a good thing to have hospiscare nurses throughout your breast cancer journey i was sorry to read that you have a cough and i hope it clears up since you were breathless the oncologist was right to check it out and to order an and ct scan we have to remember how toxic chemotherapy drugs are and every little symptom needs to be checked to be on the safe side it is awful to have to traipse around hospitals along never ending corridors i cannot begin to imagine how you must have felt having one cannula put in with a lot of pain and then having to have it taken out because it was in the wrong place you must have been absolutely exhausted especially after a late night trying to get the boiler to work and having a bad headache the good thing is that you had a happy ending with the ct scan and and that all was revealed to be well now you can go ahead with the second lot of chemotherapy and get that behind you just think ahead and think of wednesday evening what a good daughter you have to have taken the initiative and started getting dinner i bet you were relieved that the heating engineer turned up and i hope you now have heating and hot water do you have a combi boiler we have them in our apartment complex and some residents find it difficult to cope with them the secret is to keep the pressure gauge at the required level and not to fiddle with it too much i hope you are feeling better today and will manage to have a good sleep so that you feel in good form for wednesday rest assured that we shall all be thinking of you and that we shall wishing you all the best i was doing a bit of reading about the different chemotherapy drugs and read that cyclophosphomide cytoxan and fluorouracil efudex do not cause hair loss but that epirubicin ellence and doxorubicin adriamycin do the taxanes docetaxel taxotere and paclitaxel taxol also cause hair loss have a nice dinner tonight and get plenty of rest and hopefully sleep tight a cup of camomile often ensures a good sleep i recently read that it was also a good preventive let us know how things go tomorrow thinking of you sylvia xxxx i stopped taking tamoxifen at the end of september and my constipation lessened quite a lot i take other meds that also make me constipated i still get nausea was hoping that would end but it i have no joint pain now that was the tamoxifen making me ache sure i took tammi at night and that helped with the flushes and upset tummy as long as i slept on a high pillow chick glad you literaly survived the first infusion how lucky we all are to have sherrie to guide us through this tough one as one sister put it someday we most likely will have our turn with it i was adviced to have all fresh veggies fruit soaked for half an hour rinse well with apple vinegar mostly did fine while on taxotere still suffered every now and then from the constipation despite all that fiber consumption i hope it goes easier for you with each infusion hugs love ebru second rachel on this one the one thing that is sort of keeping me in check about my feeling like a slug is thati have to remind myself that since jan 2nd of this year my body has had to deal with something toxic in it of course why tired why mentally sluggish why feeling things physically that are different if you think something off in your liver have it checked out our livers have been working overtime you tell me that after all of this we earned the right to be a bit paranoid dreading the next timei catch a serious cold or flu finishing treatment is one thing but there a whole lot they can offer for what we are going to go through mentally for the nextfew months except therapy and you know your body more than anyone if you feel like something is wrong make someone check it out and yeah i feel a bit of a hypocrite because i should heed my own advice more often than i do in the back of my mind i think okay i just finished all the treatments for bc i just take a pass on anything that could be serious just for a while couple of months funnily enough my onc turned out to be sympathetic to this as well when i went formy recentone month post chemo he finally mentioned my taking tamoxifen but he was going to hold on prescribing it until next month he thought that i could use the break after rads and also wanted to see about giving my ovaries some extra time to kick back into gear what slaps me mentally i realize that i injected my body with something that shut down my ovaries so the time it takes for us bounce back yeah going to be a while not the doctor we know what is something that be alarming or what is still the effects of chemo or rads if you know who to consult consult everyone and see who calls back first reread your post yeah i know what you mean by crappy before bc i would ascribe howi feel to being in a blue funk not a whole lot of energy and even less motivation to do something about it just sort of eh blah i wonder if it could be likened to post partem depression the situations completely dissimillar when you think about it hmmm time to google forward to the mind clarity i think i need to do a detox cleanse but need to have at least a week where i can be home and close to the bathroom since you end up urinating a lot and i m a little tired of the little projects that i would like to get done like weaning myself off of ambien weaning myself off megestrol before starting tamoxifen getting my cat through his month of liver meds jeez i just started whining i know the rads are making me feel funky becausei know inthis company i should be am extremely grateful that my rads experience was a cake walk and while i know it sucks that others are feeling this energy malaise if you will sort of comforting to know that you guys are feeling it too because honestly catch up on posts and sometimes think how are they doing that a slug oh and the commitments isssue yeah had to cancel on so many things this year which came with own set of mental disappointments and been really hard to hear of fun things going on with friends or having to decline invites because i knew i going to be able to make it or thought that i would but on the day having to cancel another transition to work on being able to make commitments and feel like i can keep them but i know that will happen just going to take time hell it took me 6 months to get to this point the least i can do is give myself 6 months to get back to where i was and lastly i know today is a holiday and an important one that i truly respect but today just felt like another day not a monday in particular just another day hmmm see what i mean about the apathy i know the fatigue talking and ugh now pissing myself off because that sounded so pathetic argggggghhhh just last night i went to a concert where i literally laughed nonstop for two and a half hours and today sounding so tragic what is up with that catherine ok this is bugging me i started weekly taxol back in september by the third tx my longish hair was falling out by handfulls so i had my dh give me a buzz cut the hair continued to fall but there was still quite a bit hanging on my hair exceptionally thick i had an allergic reaction to the third taxol then a sinus infection that delayed tx for a week instead of the usually one week break between infusions i had 2 weeks today i will have tx 3 of round 2 doc switched me to abraxane the hair on my head has quit falling out i still have my eyebrows and i have a partial brazilian thing going on dh says he thinks at least some of the hair on my head is growing all the documentation i received on both the taxol and abraxane said that hair loss on these tx is 100 what gives my girlfriend is even doing an eyebrow watch sort of freaking out that maybe the tx working because the hair is hanging on not only that sort of peeved that my hair was finally longer than it had ever been before i buzzed it and now it looks like i might not have needed to ugh i have more scans until december or maybe january hugs diane my hair started to grow back on dd taxol but lost my eyelashes and brows they grew back in quickly but have lost them 3 more times post tx last chemo 09 this last time the brows just thinned and the lashes fell out slowly while new oneswere coming in hope the brow and lash thing stops soon hi sunshine not on tamoxifen rather an ai the thing that works for me for the bone pain is claritin or its generic loratidine in the form nobody seems to be sure why it works but it does for a number of us if i run out for a few days the bone pain is right back only to be relieved again once back on it for a couple of days unfortunately it help with my numerous other joint aches and pains a never ending quest to get relief from that my mo is ok with it and my allergist says its safe to take long term you should check with your pharmacist to find out if any interaction with tamoxifen if you do decide to try it it also of course helps for its intended purpose allergy relief anne welcome as well i would be in much worse shape without these women what protocol are you on as there are some on the board with different regimens you might find one similar to yours and side effects are side effects no matter what the drug roxi i do hope you get something that works for the bone pain advil and tylenol did not touch mine before the claritin but neupogen pain i know if different from taxol pain what a pain in the ass sometimes literally and yes my under the armthing is better but i will be calling some office tomorrow i know if i should call the onc or my pcp in charge of underarm nipples anyone yes suddenly it seems like pink ribbons are on everything i applaud the effort and i think they have achieved their goal of raising awareness i am supportive but would not wear or buy half probably more of the things that end up being pink i have to watch my sarcasm tone as i alerted my older dd to this phenomenon and now she notices as well i think it is more for people without bc than those living lived through it i personally do not need pink ribbons on everything i own to be reminded i have had bc i experienced this over the past week because my mom has a sticker from the komen foundationaffixed to the windshield of her car which we used to drive down to anaheim so i had a pink ribbon staring at me on the passenger side screaming breast cancer every time i was in the car i realize until just now how really unnerving that was hmmmmm maybe time for bed sorry for the soapbox rant basia the preventive immodium is my usual defense against the big d when i want to get out be cause it can strike at any time with very little warning my oncologist also gave me lomotil to take in top of the immodium i seem to be able to buy time with the combo she seemed perplexed that the d never clears up for me even toward the end of a cycle but on a recent visit she said i am not the only one of her patients and that the persistent problem may be the perjeta also ended up with a blocked tear duct which means tears stream down the right side of my face constantly my opthamologist tried to open it with a little instrument but no luck so going in for an office procedure to possible snip it open somehow if that work it is outpatient surgery it keeps my vision blurry most of the time when i was examined i told her i had bc and was getting chemotherapy she asked me if taxotere is involved since it is notorious for blocking tear ducts yes taxotere is certainly involved radical i hope your taxol went more smoothly this time and that there has been no hospital involvement hi again before bc i was fit and active no weight probs etc was 50 at dx 3 yrs ago since then was on tamox for 2 yrs that was not too bad had a few aches and a bit of tiredness but i could cope then as new regieme they changed me to exemastane thought at begining was ok the joint pains are not nice but again can cope with them funny you mention a dry mouth but i have noticed i am always thirsty my breathing is not good have had ct scan to rule out any thing else that was fine and now am being checked for asthma which is all new to me i dont want to change if i can help it and like you have another 2 yrs to go have lung function tests tommorrow it is all making me feel low and always feeling tired sorry to rant and thanks for listening hope you stay fit and well hugs annie x hello ladies i just found this thread i started chemo 22 with adriamycin and cytoxin x4 i am now on taxol and herceptin with week 5 of 12 on tuesday i was lucky with a c for se as i was mostly just tired with very mild nausea the cytoxin messed with my sinuses but none of it was horrible now with the taxol and herceptin i feel like i live in a desert my sinuses are so dry and a bit bloody my skin is like paper sometimes i just keep up the mantra drink more water like every 5 minutes for the ladies who have gone from chemo to rads did you already have surgery my tumor was really big 6x6x9 cm so i am doing chemo to shrink it then surgery then if needed rads i was just wondering about the order most go in hang in there linny i am also doing fec i have had 2 treatments i have any problems with my finger nails while doing taxol i noticed after 2 of fec they started to pull away from my nail beds i hope you bypass this side affect nancy good to see you post again please take care of yourself brenda i have also joined a workout club i try to go everyday that i am able i know for me it gives me a little more energy to do the things i need to do everyday keep it up you are brave about doing jazzercise bareheaded i keep my hanky on my head and breathe extra when i am sweating and having hot flashes jenster i pray for fall also i spent sometime in dardanelle ar a couple of summers ago i thought i was going to have a heart attack i imagine how you can handle hot flashes and the heat i am please that you were able to volunteer as you wanted to what part of arkansas are you from pray for cooler weather for us all everybody take care hi great news about your friend i hope she can skip chemo have a great time in mexico counting the days until my trip cathy i hope you get good news on your blood counts i will switch to an ai in the fall after my hysterectomy i was dreading the joint pain but i am so sick of the hot flashes from tamoxifen willing to give the ai a try my doc says i can switch back if i need to carolyn so glad the scare was just that my pts kicks in now and then i visited a friend in the hospital after her double mast about a month ago and it really kicked in then i have decided to go with the robot i really want minimal scarring and recover time waiting until fall because my mom is retiring this summer and she can take care of me and i want to give the doctor more time to practice with the robot as of now only done the surgery about 10 times jazz festival time in new orleans our old neighbors in portland are coming this week for a visit and go next sunday for the closing day great food multiple music stages jazz blues gospel plus big names onthe mainstages i am most excited about seeing the racontuers and the neville brothers who traditionally played last but who have not played the fest since before hurricane katrina sure be an emotional set nice to hear from everyone mary debbie 53 i have to say my first treatment with taxo had the worst of the diarrhea same as you had treatment on tuesday and on friday yikes but i was also on percoset for the body bone musle pain that caused constipation needless to say neither was pleasant however the diarrhea was the worst my doctor gave me something lomodil sp which is just a bit stronger than immodium it worked wonders but i still struggled with both until about 6 weeks after treatment ended the other thing my nurses suggested was the brat diet bananas rice applesauce and toast just remember this is all temporary just popping in to say i know scary but doable if it is positive i started treatment october 17 2012 3 mets to my liver treatment was weekly taxol 18 weeks country may have different standard and herceptin and perjeta every 3 weeks which i see you have had taxol and herceptin but there are other combos too i guess my question is why did treatment stop in february or whenever seems odd to me but not the dr anyway the point i initially started to make was i am here 3 years later almost ned and very stable since finishing taxol in february 2013 i plan on continuing this treatment for as long as possible my fatigue is quite debilitating but could be worse hang in there terber i have been on femara for almost 6 years i have had some tiredness in the beginning and hot flashes of course but nothing that has impacted my quality of life i have had some bone loss for which i was taking fosamax but started having issues with that so i recently stopped taking that i continue on the femara for me it is my security blanket when i hit my 5 year mark my onc said it was up to me if i wanted to stay on it or not you can either try the femara and see if you have any side effects or you can say enough already there are no rules that you have to follow you are the patient and you get to decide whether or not you want to take any rx noone knows for sure whether or not you will have benefit from the femara it would be really easy if we knew for sure there have been decisions all the way thru this cancer journey and it is no different for you now make your decision about what you feel would be best for you and go with that once the decision is made it is the right decision go with your gut hang in there hi ladies have not been on board since 5 feb since just trying to deal on my end constipation is still a very painful problem despite the laxative protocol so bad it has me doubled up and the pain feels like child birth otherwise just the same old fatique with the weekly taxol the b6 works great for the neuropathy and advil as needed for bone joint pain treatment after my week off seems to be the worst which are the days i am going through right now i am so glad to that other ladies have completed the mark i will be a lonely gal as i go through the 2 years of taxol boohoo on me ursela hortense i do the same thing with the squirt bottle for the first few days it really did help the days i was in the hospital and have the option were really bad so i know it worked vicki please check in when you can you are smart to leave i know hard but we need you as healthy as possible here did hubby join you yet fierro i am sorry you are still not sleeping i am feeling quite done with this whole thing and i know i have almost a year to go my stupid trick of the week hubby decided to my buzz cut with scissors no biggie when he was done and it was hot out he got a wet paper towel to wipe my head with it was cold and the shock of it stunned me and i burst into tears it hurt but in a way i feel like my body is in defense mode i am just so tired of hurting sade my nails have darkened on ac too i thought it was taxol i had to worry about stacie i hear you on the fatigue i am barely getting out of bed these days i keep trying but i am just so damn tired all the time sandi i like that you passed out last week either melrose love nothing more than to have a bed and sleep away the infusions going to attempt to work today wish me luck hi klynni have been on lupron for 4 months i too have terrible joint pain if i sit for more then 5 minutes and get up it takes me a while to loosen up 37 feeling something much older supposed to be on tamoxifen but have been bad about taking it so it is all the lupron i have a hard time believing all this stuff is good for me when you can do things you normally do i to share some of the other s e thatyou are mentioning fortunate though that once i start moving around i notice any pain a postive thing about lupron i hear it may be good for alzheimers karen i have no idea what your diagnosis is but i will say that the more advanced your cancer was the more important it is to take tamoxifen i urge you to go to the cancermath site which will help you understand the true benefit i also believe that diet can do the same thing that any of the hormonal drugs does the np explained this concept to me when they perscribed acidophilous pills to me with an antibiotic i asked about yogurt and she said i would have to eat something like 50 gallons to get the same benefit i may have the quantity incorrect but you get the point these really are wonder drugs for any of us who are er i have a friend who get tamoxifen at the and got lung mets she is just fine as long as she takes hormonals and has been ned for more than 10 years it can be that important remember too that most of us do well on any hormonal therapy a minority of women have severe symptoms but most are minimal with arimidex i have a slight dry mouth and a bit of achiness all i think it is well worth it as i am 50 more likely to be here in 10 time if i take it a major no brainer claire i did almost nearly exactly what your wife is doing i did 6 cycles of tch and was ned my onc wanted me to do a year of tykerb with my herceptin i also was am still on tamoxifen i took my tykerb in the evening i took 4 pills on an empty stomach i take my tamoxifen in the morning i just had one bad day of diarrhea i am not at all a fan of immodium so i changed my diet and went to my naturalist for some supplements that stopped the trots i took this combo for year and now i am just back to herceptin plus tamoxifen i never really found anything that helped with the rash however the finger tip splitting is a real bear i would get some udder joy or similar cream to use as a preventative on the hands good luckjennifer i have been on abraxane avastin since i go 1x week for 4 weeks then have one week off i also have thursday for my chemo day so i can work mon wed the nausea medicine they give me before the abraxane usually wears off friday evening other a little numbness in my toes some joint pain and fatigue also hair thinning loss pretty tolerable with pain meds and anti nausea oh and also i have bone and liver mets started with 50 or so liver mets now down to 10 small ones and bones are stable my tumor markers started at 1100 now down to 50 and still falling soooo good luck strength and courage i usually post on this thread but i did posta bit back when it first started 5 years ago today i took my last tamoxifen it honestly went by pretty fast my only were hot flashes and insomnia i am supposed to start on femara now for the next 5 years now that this 10 year tamox study came out i am wondering if i should just stay on it rather than switch chemo put me in menopause hugs to all you ladies going through this once i told my doctor that i wanted to be regularly tested he started testing all of his patients over 50 years of age the last time i was in to see him he told me he was shocked at the number of his patients who were very low in vitamin d he said it was over 60 of his patients as i started taking over the counter d i went in for a blood test every 6 months to make certain that i taking too much d that is how my doctor and i came up with the correct dose for me i am not suggesting that 4000 iu is the right dose for everyone it depends on how the body processes the supplement the minimum level of 30 ng ml is what is needed to prevent rickets it is not necessarily the ideal level since i have had my level at around 55 ng ml i have actually had improvement in my bone density arimidex had put me into osteopenia throughout my spine and hips and put two of my vertebra into osteoporosis getting my vitamin d level up has improved my bone density enough that one of those two vertebra is now out of osteoporosis and all areas have improved slightly i was on arimidex for 4 years and now i am on aromasin quite frankly the ses are the same three more months and i get to stop taking it hooray hi everyone 44 and had a biopsy last june which showed i had atypical hyperplasia cells i went ontamoxifen and just stopped last week because it caused horrible mood swings and depression stand it anymore not the kind of person who can just sit back and do nothing because i would worry myself sick decided to have the double mastectomy and reconstruction my surgeon is recommending the latissmus flap reconstruction which would be done at the same time as the mastectomy she said it was a little more painful but the recovery was easier since i already have a scar across my abdomen from a previous surgery not sure they could do anything but the latissimus flap i have two appointments on tuesday to check out a couple of plastic surgeons has anyone had this type of reconstruction that can share their experience with me any and all input would be appreciated thanks carolyn my first chemo was thursday january 20 cytoxan and adriamycin every three weeks for four sessions and then on to four sessions of t everything went well the usual you are a hard stick followed but an uneventful 2 and a half hour drip felt ok friday just tired saturday was a roller coaster however woke up nauseous and headachy and sad and depressed it was the first day i thought that i might not be able to do this cried it out and then oncce again moved on smoothies movies naps friends thought i was ok even went back to work monday but i was very sick vomitting and diarrhea all wednesday night would love to have a crystal ball to know if it was coming regardless of what i did or if i ate something wrong is this part of the pattern but i again am feeling well enought to work business office in a automobile dealership played cards with my friends last night no drinking though any opinions on that so on saturday i will be wig shopping i may get my hair cut very short on friday bear the thought of it coming out in clumps i still hold to i must count my blessing and be grateful for all i have been given i will not go down the pitty path i will be strong as all of you before me and come through this changed but healed and whole may 29 2011has it been that long since i started this adventure finished four sessions of ac had minimal side effects just exhaustion had two of taxitiere terrible mouth pain and loss of taste exhaustion changed to taxatore this week my toenails are lifting and coming off of my big toes ugly and painful amy suggestions or

stamina to finish this encouragment please nettie i had the pain like a hammer hitting the scalp when i started losing my hair but i recall anything when it came back in i see you started aromasin in january experienced some weird sensations on anastrozole nothing in the scalp but some other weird feelings i e motion after being in a car for several hours kind of like sea legs never had that before in my life and i feel certain it was the anastrazole and getting used to it av2 welcome to the group as brena mentioned there is a lot of information from other ladies who have gone thru or

loose track of everyones doeses i too have had a number of panic attackes while in the hospital after surgery is when they started feeling trapped claustrophbic like it was strang for me never having experienced that before also with some of my treatments this claustrphobic feeling of this medicine in my body that is killing cells and i get it out of me crazy sh t hope it gets better for you i am happy you are getting real hair i wait i too have had nite flashes but i always had them occasionaly in the past now just more and more often sleep well either i feel like i am just laying there looking at the clock i have ambian but i hate to take it if i have to take care we can do it polly hi bevrog i was dx jan 2015 at 41 had wle anc followed by 16 of chemo 20 rts also put on tamoxifen as er pr status was 8 periods came back in dec but i decided to have ovaries out instead of zoladex as had enough of side effects from meds and like you had completed my family so now going through menopause for the 2nd time and have stopped taking tamoxifen for 2 months to let hand rash caused by tamoxifen tosettle before going onletrozole i want to take another med zoladex with potential side effects and contra effects with tamoxifen also having the ovaries removed gave me peace of mind re ovarian cancer and irregular periods and pms the keyhole op itself was very straigh forward only had discomfort for the first few days and then back to normal exercise within 2 weeks since started taking sage tablets as a natural approach to settle hot flushes and been even more effective than i expected having ovaries out has worked for me but you need to decide best for you good luck with the decision x been on tamoxifen for 6 weeks now have aching joints and a very sore back if i stand cooking baking etc i frequently have a pain like a headache above my right eye socket i have tinnitus and itching deep inside my ears i also have a sore bottom like nappy rash which stings dreadfully if any urine gets near it using sudocreme and canestan cream but nothing seems to help any advice gratefully received please let me know if anyone has similar problem i think at times i am becoming unhinged all of this from a drug which is supposed to be helping me i had previously tried femara and another similar drug arimidex but the side effects were even worse hi joining you all for those that just started tamoxifen started about weeks ago with the watson brand so far no hot flashes but noticed some joint stiffness age 33 so blaming it ontamoxifen taking biotin daily and using nioxinshampoo several times a week i go through chemo but had thin enough hair already so want to take the chances of it going any thinner statdown like you just waitingfor theother shoe to drop in terms of ses thanks hils as far as i know there is no group for lesbians with breast cancer in christchurch probably one for straight women but i checked as far as i am concerned it is the tamoxifen that is playing havoc with my moods as did the arimidex even though the gp said he seen this as a in 20 years of general practice and nor does it appear as a side effect in the literature at the same time there seems to be a great deal of anectdotal evidence from women taking it or who have taken it that it is an issue i have had issues with oestrogen around depression anger aggression irritability irrationality and so on and right from the start of this breast cancer journey i was a tad concerned that taking any medication that modified the oestrogen or the effects of the oestrogen i know what it feels like to be in a big way it was a way of life for me until i was prescribed the contraceptive pill even at that stage late 1970s early 80s the only thing the docs were interested in was whether or not i could get pregnant assuming i wanted to menopause came as something of a relief and i have been relatively stable since i went through that process iknow there is something going on with my body and also that it has been obvious only since the completion of the radiation therapy and the beginning of the hormone therapy and now i think i could easily get into a major rant so i will stop here and wish you well as you also continue your own journey with this the thought of starting chemo is terrifying i know that because been there my journey started with stage iiic so the treatment was hard they are trying to eliminate the cancer so it never comes back i did 7 months of chemo had my surgery had my 33 days of rads and then since i had no response to the original chemo we tried to do another round of chemo after all that yes it was scary at the start but once i got started i found out it was doable for me i started off taking it a week at a time i just fathom 7 months time went by much faster than i had imagined it that scary after i got started and found my routine you can do this there is an advantage being stage iv if the chemo is too hard then you can switch to another chemo you get that option in the lesser stages and there are lots of chemos to try currently i am on xeloda and it is treating me well and seems to be doing the job on the cancer i also wonder if a lot of your current pain is due to the tamoxifen it is very possible i also would caution you to ask your docs about radiation side effects i currently have a lot of lower back pain i just went through a ct scan and the onc see anything new he said that everything looked stable so now he is chalking up my back pain to the two sessions of rads that i had to kill the tumors in the lumbar sacrum iliac area initially the rads took care of the bone pain but now the lower back feels so stiff and i figure out what to do to get any relief just be aware of the potential effects of your treatments take small bites try to take it all in at once you can do it kitty i just did my third of 12 weekly taxol yesterday it is much better than ac my only are bloody nose when blowing and sores in nose and acid reflux i have my treatments every wednesday and i only take that day off from work i sleep good the night of treatment probably because of steroids etc i take no nausea meds at all usually by friday night after work i am pretty tired and go to bed early but other than that i am fine knock on wood i have been taking a glutamine pill daily to help with neuropathy so far so good i also rub tea tree oil in all of my nails once a day so far so good with that also hope this helps hello everyone me again 2tzuz i feel your pain and frustration i have days like that too but luckily for me theyhave not been somany that they seem to not end i think it just gets to you sometimes carrying around this load i did read that one of the side effects of arimadex can be depression maybe that is what you are experiencing since it does not seem to subside for you other people have said they switched to the other meds as it created too many problems for them i think one of them was aromasin if spelling it correctly and the other is tamoxifen might be worth talking to your oncologist about oh and the restless leg thing that reminded me last night i experienced a little of that just for a short period but you know what i also experience that when i take benedryl not always but it has happened and that was before the arimadex funny thanks patoo i do try to be positive about this whole situation carolyn i wish you luck with hair regrowth i had taxotere 4 years ago and my hairregrowth consisted of a pitiful baby fine muff around the bottom of my head none on top and no regrowth of eyebrows or lashes just the hair on my legs grew back but even that was sparse i had permanent makeup tattoos done for my eyebrows unfortunately i was just diagnosed with a local recurrence and have started chemo all over again 3 infusions of halaven which i could not tolerate and will start cmf in 2 weeks so now i am once again as bald as kojack hoping a side effect will be that my hair regrows after i finish chemo this time around good luck to you no one understands how devastating alopecia is until they have experienced it jo congratulations so happy you got the good news wrenn the long post this because ive not been able to stay awake long enough lately to get a post out that addressed everyone i missed previously figured first thing in the morning was my best bet and because i had a later start time for chemo i took advantage and got my normal post out so happy you got the blood builder i have to tell you my mo looked at my blood tests they did just prior to my appt w her and she said you must be doing something right because you are just 2 points shy of your hemoglobin being back in the normal range i reminded her about the blood builder and she was very impressed by it remember it was just 3 weeks ago i was told i was anemic began taking blood builder and look how far its gotten me in such a short period of time i love that stuff well we finally did chemo today had a little anxiety start as we were waiting they were about an hour behind but that was because i had a really bad headache and was fearing chemo might do something to aggrevate it and the blood draw was a little ok much more uncomfortable than i anticipated that hurt when then accessed the port damn nobody prepared me for that and it was most unexpected found out later its because its a large needle being used i will definitely be using lidocaine crme in the future to get it numbed up about an your before going in i felt as good leaving chemo as i did going in no problems as all port worked very well had no bad effects from the sucked on ice chips during adriamycin infusion and they ran the cytoxin over 60 minutes just to make sure i had no allergic reaction was a very long day from am to pm and im beat but no ses at all that can all change by tomorrow but im not going to worry about it if something comes up i either have been given meds to handle it or i call and get advise on what to do or what to take it really was no big im sure fatigue is going to be an issue given how many problems im having w fatigue and the lyrica already and i do worry a bit about bone pain after neulasta injection tomorrow because i take loratadine every day for allergies that is the generic of claritan so i fear it will not be as helpful to me as it is to others because my body is so used to it already ill just have to wait and see and i have the weekend to recoup should i need it falling asleep here ill post more tomorrow i was on tamoxifen for a year with no sign effects except hot flashes night sweats i was switched to arimidex in april of this year after i had a complete hysterectomy i can honestly say i really had any significant side effects on this drug either except hot flashes night sweats although this could be just natural menopausal stuff i am able to deal with those and feel blessed that is my only se alot of people do have significant side effects but let that scare you you very well could be one of those who do not have any significant side effects think positive dianamarie i had my first round of tc taxotere and cytoxan on feb 11 this is my 2nd breast cancer diagnosis first was in 2005 age 41 and now again in jan 2014 49 i had 4 a c and 4 taxol first time around i remember absolutely hating the a aka red devil made me so ill this first round has wiped my butt i had the neulesta shot on wednesday afternoon and let me tell you the pain and achiness was everywhere my face my teeth my head felt like someone was drilling into it my shoulders legs back i had two horrible days on friday and saturday i am taking claritin and two tylenol 3 with codeine at night for pain how can someone have diaharrea and constipation in the same day sorry too much tmi i am extremely exhausted forgotten how much this crap zaps the energy from you i have been taking 2 hour naps in the afternoon or i would fall asleep sitting up loli had no appetite from wednesday until this afternoon i have lost 22 pounds since my diep reconstruction surgery in december and post chemo treatment i did manage a protein shake today and an english muffin with peanut butter on it for lunch i feel a little hungry so will most likely get some dinner into me three more treatments i can do this is my silent mantra hugs to all you ladies having a rough time michele my gosh it has been a long time since i posted here if you mind i have a question has anyone run into an allergic reaction to the taxotere after 10 days past their third treatment i was sitting in court the other day with the typical runny nose i have from days through days 14 when i started to feel like sand mites were biting me all over i feel any tongue swelling or anything but the time i got home from work my feet were so swollen i could hardly get them out of my heals i took my clothes off and found what looked like pink bumps turned out to be the bg of hives starting to blossom all over my body of course call my mo office and they told me to take benadryl i told him that i had already taken two he gave me a prescription for hydroxyzine plus more ativan by four in the morning i could feel my through closing and i got out of bed covered in hives all over my hands and feet especially a trip to the er resulted in an all day event where my office even going to come see me until the next morning the doctor who looked at me reassured me he spoke with my mo the nurse in charge impressed and made the practice doctor come take a look at me at pm his took pictures then he said i was probably done with taxotere what does that mean i am supposed to have another round of chemotherapy any one else run into this thanks kimberly aoibheann sorry you are having so much trouble with neuropathy and your nails i am not having any problem with my nails though i do experience neuropathy i take gabapentin twice a day been on taxol since december 2012 3 weeks on 1 week off i had the nail issues with taxotere and had to stop the chemo because the neuropathy got so bad hated to stop because it was working well on my cancer robin best wishes with the doxil we just keep trying til we find something that kicks some cancer butt been on doxil before but will have to look back at my notes to see why i was stopped gail dear gail i agree with latte only you should make the decision when not to try another chemo lost track of the number of chemos tried some have worked for a while some not at all but we keep looking for one i can tolerate that works and has minimal it is your life your decision will be thinking of you as you struggle with the decisions you need to make who knows maybe megace will be your magic bullet just finished my 5 years of tamox and it really so bad mainly hot flashes which i had anyway eventually from menopause a baby aspirin 1 mg can be used to help prevent blood clots if ok with your physican i take it and was fine but now doc recommends it with the evista taking maybe cuz now 5 years older 51 anne noticed lately a little pudgy belly before it would always be just a temporary thing that would eventually deflate after a day or two and always had a flat belly even after 3 kids but the past several months noticing that it gone down at all and my weight has maintained steadily for over 2 years where i want it to be i think also a menopause thing not necessarily a tamoxifen thing been on tamoxifen 21 months but i had a period in 6 months so thinking that maybe this time i am possibly in full menopause went previously for 9 months with no period then it came back for a few months and i get any belly fat then hello ladies i have not posted in about a month but have checked in daily and kept up with all your posts i am glad to hear that you are all doing well and have either started the last phase of your chemo treatments or have finished them all together i was invited to join a private fb page for young women with breast cancer there was a lady who completed her treatment 1 week before me same stage as myself but triple negative i do not know if she had any nodal involvement about a week after her last treatment she was having issues with her arm went for pet scan and it was revealed that shehad mets to her brain last week she had a stroke and was in a coma i found out she passed away yesterday she did briefly come out of her coma and was lucid for about 5 hours and was able to spend that time with her family although i did not know her personally only briefly through the fb page it has hit me quite hard and very upsetting i hate this cancer and that we anyone has to deal with it pmr 53 i have not had my reconstruction yet but i had 2 drains from my bmx i had made a lanyard and safety pinned the drains to the lanyard that way there was no risk of me accidentally pulling on them plus it was nice that it was adjustable for when i had baths i stripped my drains every couple of hours and right before measuring the fluid spookisgirl i am happy to hear that you are starting to feel better and your blood counts are back up i hope your cold breaks soon and you will be back on the road to recovery i

back on your dancing feet stillstruggling i hope you start feeling soon how many more rounds do you have to go hopefully you will be able to negotiate your mo down on the neulasta shots i fortunately did not require them so i do not know what the se are thecolorpurple my onc is also recommending that i either have an oophorectomy or chemically shut down my ovaries due to the positive results that came from the soft trial i meet with my onc this friday to discuss hormonal treatment i made up my mind which way i am going to go but i would like to know what the long term affects will be if i have my ovaries removed at the age of 31 i am lucky in a sense that i really get pms or mood swings but i am definitely in chemopause and have hot flashes only at night when i am trying to sleep almost every hour on the hour i am scared to see just how bad they will get if i rid my body of estrogen tennisfan thank you for checking up on me that is wonderful of your sister to join you for moral

they are but look like it i try to keep my nails as dry as possible and always wear gloves when doing dishes as they seem to hurt more when wet now that they are growing out it kind of looks like there is a new nail growing under the old one there is a bump on each nail where the old one meets the new one i hope i loose the nails but small price to pay rvgal that is a very cute puppy makes me want to get another dog please posts more pics when you get her as i mentioned above i too have been experiencing hot flashes they were worse during chemo all day night and the dexamethasone made me have horrible night sweats now that i am done chemo the hot flashes have subsided but i still have them at night when i am trying to sleep i have not had a solid sleep since february i will be discussing this with my mo as i am sure not healthy to be awake all day and then have interrupted sleep at night i did read the soft results and they look very promising i do not think i will go with an oophorectomy right now i will try the pills that will stop my ovaries if i am able to handle menopausei will then look at surgery i want to make any drastic decisions that i cannot go back on other than the hot flashes i have been feeling pretty good but the fatigue is definitely still there it is getting better but i do get tired very easily i am hoping exercise will help with that i meet with my plastic surgeon tomorrow to discuss my reconstruction he uses a 1 stage tissue expander that stays in and acts as a permanent implant once filled to desired size i would like to have my surgery in sept to give me the summer off to relax and get strong healthy my insurance company wants me to go back to work in june and then will give me sept end of the year off recovery from surgery this has me quite stressed out as it will not have been a full year since my diagnosis nor have i even began to deal with my emotions that cancer has caused i understand where they are coming from but at the same time i feel like they are ignoring that there is more to recovery than just chemo surgery i will be discussing this with my mo on friday and hope that she will agree to keep me off work for another year to complete all my surgery s and get better mentally physically i apologize for the long post and wish all you ladies the best hi purplegurll i also had a c four rounds dd but it was hard on me i am currently on 12 weekly taxol 9 tomorrow it is definitely easier on me except i have been developing neuropathy and edema i sure hope you do well with your treatments hugs to all lilyrose hi mostlysew i have had problems with hair shedding in the past i had no problems with hair shedding or eyelash shedding with radiation are these gals at your radiation taking hormonal therapy arimidex and tamoxifen etc have side effects which include hair shedding you know people forget about the compromised immune system there is nothing wrong with gently telling people sorry not kissing anyone while on immune surpressing meds if this person is a friend they will understand if not they be kissing you anyway and as for taxotere with nulasta i had rough leg hip and foot pain and mild nosebleeds all cleared up except foot pain within weeks of finishing up the chemo foot painn subsided with orthotics river i wish you all the best the bone pain is rough i just laid on the couch and watched dora the expolorer over and over with my 2 yr old at the time and then watched sex in the city reruns nonstop after she went to bed annie hello everyone i have been reading but not writing for the past couple of months just no energy i finished my last chemo yesterday 4ac dose dense 12 taxol i feel so relieved i am getting avastin for the next 30 weeks 10 treatments every 3 weeks what i have now is a horrible rash on my body taxol related neuropathy in the hands and feet and no taste for the past 2 months some peach fuzz on my head all white but no other body hair anywhere hot flashes and depression and night sweats but being treated with effexor for that i want my life back how soon do all the side effects go away thanks for being here it has helped to read everyones stories kathy jodi glad lulu is better petrified of this mess coming back i know a normal reaction but getting obsessed looking up stats this is tearing my family apart this was a hard weekend cancer drains you of everything mentally financially spirituality the finance side caught up to my hubby this weekend as we are still fighting insurance and we have help with the kids like we usually do after a chemo treatment so everyone in our house was just crazy overwhelmed peach rant away had some of those same feelings it helps me know not alone i have one more dd taxol left have found the taxol being harder on you mentally i feel more and more depressed with each one after about day 5 or 6 able to drag myself out of the funk but it seems more difficult maybe just the cumulation of everything maybe just the bone and joint pain my friend pointed out been at this cancer fighting thing for 6 months already having trouble remembering what life was like before i had 4 rounds of ac and 4 rounds of t my onc told me because i am tn she wanted to be really aggressive taxol was easier in terms of nausea and fatigue but that bone and joint pain was pretty bad for me however percocet really helped in that regards and i was able to make it through you should really talk with your onc about getting taxol i think with us tn women we have to through everything at this anita writinghelps i have a reaction to the steroids similar to acne that rivals that of a 14 year old boy they gave me cleocin t which helps a lot i put it on my face and head i also get a lot of benadryl at infusion too i react to taxotere went to prompt care today ear infection and sinus infection they gave me zpak a couple weeks ago which obviously do the trick we have moved on to augmentin we shall see what happens hi all sorry i have been mia i went off the tamox and have basically have been having horrendous anxiety attacks they last all day i think straight and panic when they happen i went to the doctor and he put me on xanax for now but also on an antidepressant that will take a couple of weeks to kick in i powered through bc and chemo powered through a lot of things in my life and have never felt like this like welcome to your nervous breakdown kel i felt myself for a couple of weeks but last week was the worse i want to relive it just say i almost passed out in the office i think after seven months of the adrenelin and all kinds of stress chemicals being released i guess my body just get normal now even though it was normal during that time this is a horrible feeling i just want to run out of my own body when it happens and it goes on all day sometimes i cry and not angry or anything just terrified of something i cannot even put my finger on or talk myself out of i think having found this last lump really did me in plus my recovery from it has been difficult the lump was right on the muscle that runs from the collarbone up to the ear so wondering if that has been a cause of my vertigo i taken any today and been okay just so done with it all taking ativan also terrified of becoming addicted to drugs but when i take them because really totally unable to function as in lying in bed totally frozen and paralyzed with fear and happening to make me afraid i will be seeing my doctor next week and discuss the tamoxifen again but at this point i imagine adding that back into the mix i never had these issues ever in my life before this rather have my ovaries out than live like this also lost about 8 pounds since i started the tamox at the end of december it ruined my appetite almost right away and i thought maybe that was a good thing and it also made me jittery which i mind because i figured it was extra energy but it finally built to the point of overload for me i guess i find it difficult to eat and nauseous with the panic today having a good day and i just wanted to check in i been on the boards in a week or so i am just trying to distance myself from the whole bc experience just temporarily until i can get back on my feet again this whole thing is just so unlike me i am just praying that the medication kicks in i like being on xanax and ativan but right now i need to do what i need to in order to function i hope everyone is doing well thank you everybody for your encouragement and wisdom i had a terrible visit with my oncologist after i got the news today he was smiling ear to ear and offering me options like tamoxifen i told him i wanted big guns liked taxotere and he told me that work because i already had taxotere it was my first know the prophalactic one i do not trust him at all i will never see him again and he offered to do nothing for me done taxotere it was pretty strong and i had a lot of problems with infections but wiser now and do it in a heartbeat if i thought it would be effective i am very puzzled because my latest biopsy from the recurrence under my arm in july was 90 er i think the liver cancer is something different maybe just liver cancer not responding to the ais but the tumors under my arm did i have an appointment next week with another oncologist at a different hospital got great credentials and i think she can help in the meantime scared to death i read my original petscan report i had to get copies of everything for the referral and it described the cancer in my liver as innumerable small spots on both lobes that was when my tumor markers were only at 38 now they are 97 i am afraid the cancer is spreading everywhere sorry for being so negative it seems like just had one bad break after another with my treatment sloppy surgery oncological incompetence taking me off the ais for example lots and lots of mistakes and delays that are too numerous too mention i believe how unlucky been and how badly been treated but not the only one whose gotten bad treatment on these boards so i guess i complain too much i just wish something good would happen for a change thanks for all your posts hopefully have something nice to post before too long kind of like this thread to continue somehow as i would probably get lost on some blog that i understand surprised i figured this discussion board out totally computer illiterate graycie wish your hair would begin growing back it should mine has been growing but the other day stubbles on the top started falling out seems to have stopped it happened on the same day that a bc friend of mine went into the shower and came out totally bald on ac now had 2 treatments we decided my hair falling out was a fluke as it happened on the same day and we had seen each other that day very wierd i still have my eye lashes and brows though the brows thin out and then fill out all the time make up their minds i have one more taxol and then go on to rads my husband made some comment about how just breezing through the taxol i have to admit that it could be worse but i slept in weeks and today i just exploded out of sheer exhaustion i told him that just breezing through because he stop to see how dang tired i am got mad at the whole family today as i was cleaning up and cooking and they were all sleeping or whatever they were doing was really pissed got numb toes and fingers and last night my toes were tingling every time they touched my legs as i tried to curl up to sleep in bed my whole body was a bundle of jitters and i had to finally get out of bed and not sleep for a few hours i had my 11th taxol on yesterday and today just was so fatigued no sleep and chemo i think at the end of my rope also so weak legs can hardly climb stairs anymore and i itch like anything because allergic to the taxol but they take me off of it so i have all kinds of creams and antihistamine quit that though because i was just too tired from it so so very uncomfortable sorry venting needed to was pretty pissed with my usually very nice family i think wondering if the chemo is working worked i talked to my onc about it and she said there is no real way to know and that i just have to be confident and remember that my nodes were negative and that was a good thing she tried to assure me that the sentinel node that was removed yes only one was negative and practically 100 accurate not so sure i agree and read of women on this board who had neg nodes and got recurrence i keep thinking about this what if there was a positive node after this one neg node and going along with keeping in touch i will give my to anyone who pms me i have it listed on my profile because of lurkers have a good weekend everybody ravdeb hi ladies i am a dec 05 chemo gal did 8 treatments 4 a c and 4 taxol for those ladies doing a c and then moving onto taxol a c is the worst of the two chemos so if you can get through that one things will be alot better once you move onto taxol i felt really awful during all 4 a c treatments had no energy the emotional withdrawals after each infusion around 4th day during taxol i had more energy and could see light at the end of the big long tunnel hair loss for me was the hardest thing but once i got use to the idea and knew the chemo was killing those little nasty cells seemed better i had no hair from dec until june 06 when it started to sprout come august my hair was coming in dark curly and really really thick i had curly hair before but it is curlier this time and i love it i thought for some inspiration i would post a picture of my peach fuzz in april 06 hair grew back slowly while on taxol my avtar was taken a few days ago so you can see how much hair grew back try to keep your spirits up surround yourself with positive people all the best ladies you can do this have a wonderful holiday season michele wenz april 06 question has anyone else experienced the ses disappearing after an ooph tamoxifen has been wreaking havoc on my body arthritis 40 lb weight gain fatty liver plantar fasciitis brain fog panic attacks etc all medically confirmed to be directly caused by tamoxifen i am 3 days out from surgery and have not felt this good since my tamoxifen break my debilitating pain is gone including the plantar fasciitis i am feeling like my body was fighting menopause and the estrogen sucking properties of the medication hi i had this watering eye problem on taxotere mine was due to scar tissue build up on outside of tear ducts i had to have stints put in i am much better i still have issues if i get a sinus infection but drops help clear it up i would reco seeing an eye doc if the other suggestions here work my onc recommended one that he knew who did this procedure often good luck i want to bump this thread up as i am definitely having blurry vision issues on tamoxifen i have been on it for 5 weeks and have noticed decreased vision i already suffer from dry eyes so this is putting me over the top at work i find that by 2pm i am totally bleary eyed long ago when i was at my eye doctor complaining of dry eyes he told me to use systane i have recently bought another bottle due to the irrritation just checking in since it has been awhile hanging in there getting ready for my 2nd taxol on tuesday not as bad as a c fewer overall ses but much more joint muscle pain than i expected not easy but not impossible confused by one thing i have been toldby my ps that rads would damage implants and he will wait until at least 2 months after radiationto do my swap to allow for complete healing fromrads he said no matter what kind of replacement implants ormy own tissue the rads are too risky in terms of damage to new tissueor to implants it makes sense so i guess i am wondering for texasrose what the differences are for you maybe dosage or procedure just asking not trying to cast doubt but am trulycurious i am not looking at rads until beginning of may so have my swap surgery til september probably you know my daughter is looking at an august 11 date for a wedding not confirmed yet but i told heri kinda wanted my new boobs for her wedding not evenofficially engaged but close and we love him and their day not about me but oh well glad i found this threat it gives me hope i had a miserable response to my first tc so the onco reduced the taxotere by 25 2nd and 3rd tx were okay but the 4th one i had last week was worse than death i have bleeding sores 1 week of extreme nausea i have blood clots am anemic with low potassium my chest port hurts and it goes on and on i am worried also about the long term implications on my health from the chemo i have only 2 treatments left but think it might be best to just consider it done now that 67 completion which i think is enough i am interested in focusing on the healthylifestyle protocols going forward that people have mentioned in this thread i truly believe that megaining 70 pounds led to a cycle of unhealthiness in my body in which cancer flourished hi kasey sorry getting a lot of problems with doxil definitely mention them all to onc some of them he may be able to help i still believe your dex is causing the gi issues i did get that indigestion too on the firstfew cycles usually started onday 5 and lasted about 2 weeks it was too uncomfortable too they had to put me on protonix the np told me it was the dex so we discontinued it now i suffer that indigestion anymore and i was able to take myself off protonix as well in fact my side effects seem to be easier with each cycle as far as mouth sores they say to gargle salt water 3x a day i have too much problem with it but been really careful on what i eat the first week also watch the fluid intake may help a little bit fatigue i do get too and i have a solution for it i get knocked out day 1 after infusion day 3 4 basically i schedule anything important on the first 4 or 5 days crossing fingers and wishing for a good scan hugs kerry missed your post on last page yes the doc thinks my arm problem is from the taxol i have too many chemo gifts very stiff achy hands achy legs parts falling asleep and oh so tired happy canada day to you i am jealous that you are getting your bathrooms redone actually that you have more than one bathroom we share 1 bathroom with 5 people it gets interesting jaimie hope the weather is getting better there it sounds like the surgery although it will be another pita is for the best and at least it laparscopic those are a bit easier to recover from besides the gas they pump inside you but that last long bethie no for you find yourself a good man you deserve that just remember he may be all nice now but he will most certainly revert to his old ways grace i actually refused to put on a gown the last 2 visits said i was sick of undressing they had just seen my chest last week they were ok with it i was being difficult and moody i guess sure your doc is just covering his buttby orderingthe mri when is it going to be done i have arm pain all the time too on my lymph side so it is my typing seems to be most affected by chemo brain i have to retype alot my ds was laughing at me as i was trying to fix his computer and was mistyping everything so frustrating i used to type 70 wpm am lucky to get out a sentence now without a mistake we are in the process of switching my care to another doctor hospital which is very we like the hospital she is with but not the doctor they are too clicky there so we just switch docs but now we also have to switch all of her home care too but i have been very happy with her old one so that worries me they want to put a jpeg feeding tube in her now and that makes me worry my other dd is showing signs of having endometriosis too and that worries me plus our insurance still switch us from condition even though i have sent all the paperwork right now i owe over for my cancer tx maybe why fatigued to much stress right now hi wise experienced ladies you all have a great group here i wanted to ask you about fatigue i finished rads on jan 21 and started tamoxifen about 2 weeks ago even though it has been like 6 weeks since the end of rads i still have that weird drained feeling that started during rads how long did it take you all to recover i really thought i would have my energy back by now i have been walking on the treadmill daily for 30 mins to increase my energy but it makes me more tired i am 52 btw wishing you all well dawn aha this must be why my onc and the onc at msk are not hot on oophs right away my onc said that it is better to have ovaries remain because there are some estrogens that are not as bad as once thought but of course he elaborate because his next sentence was his stock but the studies are not in yet this is why he prefers natural menopause so he can give the ais while letting the ovaries remain instead of forcing a fake menopause by an ooph which is also why they push tamox first and then we graduate to the ai when meno is reached thank you for posting this love g dear ann i do hope that your drain went well and that you are feeling much better and able to breathe again definitely a tough call deciding about treatment and things but have faith make the right decision for you the good news is i found the taxol was much much easier than the taxotere it cause horrible muscle pain or so much lettuce leaf syndrome days when you are super fragile not had gemcitabine it sounds less potent than taxol as it cause hair loss generally have you looked them up on the macmillan website got all the info on side effects there everyone has different survival techniques for chemo mine was to not be tempted to run about when i was on steroids by forcing myself to be quite slow for the high days as it were when they wore off mmy body exhausted and the come down was much easier i learnt that lesson on taxotere big time i also learnt to take my ibuprofen and antisick tabs religiously every day after the chemo day for a few days before any pain or flu feelings could have a chance to develop and so they never did by experimenting a bit here and there i hope you can find things that work for you take care and very best wishes fi x i was worried too about side effects of tamoxifen but i decided to try it and quit if it was awful been taking it for 14 months and it is no big deal hot flashes which are unpleasant but not and dry skin not positive from but i think it is keep putting moisturizers on good luck hey everyone i noticed a few questions about taxol i had anything else yet but i do get taxol weekly with herceptin at my first treatment i given steroids to take the night before and i had an allergic reaction to the taxol now i take steroids 12 and then again 6 hours before treatment so in my case 9pm and then again at 3am and luckily this does the job because i want to have another reaction again in terms of ses my only complaints are actually with the steroids they keep you up so i was prescribed zopiclone sleeping pills the steroids make me grumpy and they really make me hungry also twice my face has broken out pretty bad worse than as a teenager mybdoctor said it was an se of the steroids in terms of the taxol i get copies of my bloodwork every week and i noticed my wbc is starting to go down but i feel tired i lost my hair treatment 6 tommorrow i am getting another heart scan at the end of my weekly treatments to compare it to the one before i started chemo to see if the herceptin affected my heart before we start round 2 of chemo i am starting fec in december anyone else on that what is that like hi gang i know it has been a while since i have checked in i am halfway through rads i am on a trial that means higher doses of rads for less time i have been lucky no burning yet but am smearing on aquaphor and in the evening calendula a homeopathic gel i am still fighting major fatigue but it is easier than chemo just to chime in for you newbies i can share some thoughts about t c 4 the good and the bad i am sure you will have already learned lots if not all of this from the marvelous women on this site who saved me i know it is pretty basic it occurs to me that chemo is a bit like labor i cannot remember the full extent of the pain 1 of course i drank a ton of fluids the day before the day of and the day after to try to flush out toxins 2 i allowed myself to listen to my body and eat whatever it said to eat i lived on mac and cheese and chicken soup i did drink a huge amount of a natural ginger ale type drink from trader joes 3 i used the most gentle body wash i could find something like bees and once i was shaved and bald a very gentle organic shampoo 4 in the night when i sleep i did have to use the ativan or the ambien otherwise no sleep even for someone who prefers not to use drugs it was crystal clear how much i needed one of these meds 5 only the first neulasta shot bothered me with terrible bone pain it was tough to be honest i do remember that much the following neulasta shots were never ever as difficult but i did take claritan the day before the day of and a few days after 6 for nausea i found the compazine did the trick 7 bless cranberry juice i drank it nonstop during chemo because without it i learned after my first treatment that by about the 5th day post chemo i had burning urine bladder infection symptoms cranberry juice prevented those after my other treatments if you have symptoms though do call your mo becuase you want it to become serious 8 the effects did accumulate and by my last treatment i was fatigued in a way i never could have fathomed before the upside is that the other side effects seemed to lessen replaced by what can only be called unfathomable leaden fatigue this is where i learned really listening to my body it screamed to rest and rest i did 9 i was surprised by the depth of emotions during and following my final chemo i had been trying to be strong all the way through but suddenly i had no control i was furious and crying constantly it was as though i suddenly could not continue trying to be strong or perhaps i was on impressing everyone on how i kept going and finally could fall apart emotions i even know i felt surfaced now i have learned that part of that is really biochemical and can be reactions to both steroids and the chemo drugs it also became clear and continues to be clear to me that there are almost stages of grief here not dissimilar to other losses i guess what i am saying is be gentle with yourselves and keep reaching out to this site we all get it 9 so far i am not seeing any further effects from the taxotere i keep waiting to lose my nails and i did nothing for them to be honest so am surprised i did lose my eyebrows and hair but now little wisps of hair are reappearing just like spring buds i did not get any mouth sores but brushed with biotene toothpaste for dry mouth religiously i have very slight tingling in my hands but extremely slight so far so good i am hoping that you find this to be true as well of course eveyrone is different and i can only speak for myself about side effects but i do know that you can get through this meet you on the other side momat 927 testosterone can be converted to estradiol via an aromatase enzyme an aromatase inhibitor like the drug arimidex can halt most of this but i have the same question about how breast gland tissue can grow i and others in my prostate cancer support group have seen their breasts grow on taking avodart which is a drug that prevents the conversion of testosterone into the much more potent dihydrotestosterone also the prostate cancer drug bicalutamide seems to promote breast growth on the other hand there are men who have taken these drugs but have no breast growth looking for answers good evening for asking about me sorry it has taken so long for me to get online with an was very eight hours at doctors at home the baby has decided she only needs to nap for minutes at a time arrrghhh i started at the medical oncologist yesterday bp and pulse both down from last week but still much higher than when i started the t h as was weight down 6 lbs from last week thanks to double and triple doses of diuretics but still up almost 20 lbs since november also she agreed that there was a strong possiblity that the herceptin is lowering my heart function she sent me for a chest and an ekg both of which looked okay other than the fast pulse providing at least temporary comfort she upped the diuretic you can make dents in the swelling in my ankles and we decided to hold off on any more iv treatments until the muga results are in that is scheduled for next week if that is acceptable and we talk about what acceptable is i will try the every three week herceptin the benefits of the year of herceptin is pretty about an additional to the five year survivability for my case i will not go back and do taxol whatever the muga shows she feel that there would be much added benefit from the 11 doses i already completed i also had an ultrasound which showed an 8cm x 2 cm seroma under my mastectomy scar this could be an added cause to the chest tightness i have been feeling i am having that aspirated the fun never ends on thursday from there i went to the radiation oncologist for my consult i waited 1 hours in an exam before seeing him although when i finally did i liked him and felt very confident that he knows his stuff he said they are very good at shielding the heart from radiation and did not feel my symptoms warranted not doing said there is not only a difference in recurrence rates but also in five year survival rates for women with multifocal multicentric disease with positive nodes like myself he did say we would wait to start treatment until the muga had been done but said it would have to be pretty low before he would feel i should not do rads i go for my ct simulation set up next monday he recommended 28 rads with five boosts to the back of the six weeks of treatment he also said that chemo does not effectively treat cancer cells in scar tissue is not vascular enough for the chemo to circulate well i was not aware of this but it does make sense he said that is where my greatest risk of recurrence the scar tissue against my chest wall or in my axillary region i know the source of all his information but am just sharing what i was told i do feel a bit better i have been trying very hard to do all the right right low salt lots of rest daily exercise mostly walking the night sweats have almost disappeared as long as i am careful what i eat late in the evening although the heartburn and reflux continue pretty severely for those who mentioned tingling numbness and the have it in my fingertips and my toes and after i walk which i do in good quality walking shoes my feet ache to beat the band my hips are also very very sore in the joints i gave up on the eye makeup completely of course i been working so that may have made it easier to not struggle with it both eyelashes and brows are completely gone although i think i can see a faint bit of stubble coming in on both i actually have enough hair on my head now that i am warm enough to go capless inside till pretty sparse on top though and my scalp shines through the hair that has regrown i hope it thickens up or i am going to have to do the comb over i still figure out what color it is going to turn a dark ashy blonde or a light brown with a lot of silver it is absolutely baby fine petting hair my family calls it and stick are those curls i was promised lori i will be keeping keli in my prayers joyce be praying for kevin for a successful and uncomplicated surgery i hope everyone else is hanging in made it this can do it hi ladies having a unilateral right mx with expander put in on wednesday at emory hospital these tips are going to be very helpful i was looking over them again to see what i may have missed earlier i thought i saw a suggestion here for an antibacterial soap to be used before surgery to reduce the risk of infection now i cannot find it does anyone remember where it may be found i had four rounds of adriamycin cytoxan with cpin and other problems and i could not continue to the taxol portion of my treatment am 55 years old not exercising and very worried about how weak i feel i have a 23 hour stay in the hospital whiich the ps said was a gift m very concerned about pt and ot is it possible to have home health care would very much appreciate prayers for the surgeons my family and me this wednesday love sheila my mom was 49 1 day the first time and 59 1 week on the second primary no matter what age you are this disease just sucks she has now had 2 mastectomies and is going through chemo a second time she tried herceptin but had a severe allergic reaction so if i sound grouchy about it i guess i am even unjustifiably so i go for a diagnostic mammogram as i do every 6 months these days and am just sick to death of this disease maybe i am a whimp but our family aunts mom grandma etc are just exhausted from it all on the flipside i am so grateful for the survivorship our family has had i hope we are not overwhelming you with information i was told by my female med onco and female ob gyn that the best alternative for me was to have the bso ovaries and tubes only and then to go on arimidex male rads oncoand gyn onco agreed i could not take tamoxifen due to tendency to have blood clots the surgery was very easy laparoscopic but the instapause has been difficult i also had trouble with some side effects from arimidex and they have switched me to aromasin which i seem to be handling better you might consider trying the tamoxifen to see if you develop side effects and if you do not you can always have the oopher i would also double check as everyone said that although you need tamoxifen after the oopher you will need an ai to take care of the estrogen from other sources adrenal glands etc i am 47 i had the oopher last year and i still awake with soaking night sweats i did have hourly hot flashes but my onco prescribed low dose effexor which has really helped the daily flashes still have the night sweats though another side effect of the and menopause for me is mild memory loss for me that has been the most upsetting thing to tell you the truth i regret doing it blood clots are serious and so far my bones are in good shape taking lots of calcium and d3 however if i had a choice i would probably have tried tamoxifen first just to see what happens also you might see if you can get a gyn onco on call if you do decide to have the surgery in case they find something surprising i did that and it gave me some reassurance take care let them push you into making a decision until you are ready xxookatherine how long did you continue taking the glutamine and other supplements to ward off peripheral neuropathy i had stopped taking my supplements at about 2 weeks after my last dose of taxol but found the tingling resumed so i bought another container of the powder now 5 weeks post chemo but actually having side effects flare up that i never had during including itchy eyes and mouth sores a little wary of what else might come up retrievermom when did your hair start growing back in how about anyone else i still have 10 more taxol treatments and wondering if anyones hair started growing in before they were finished or do i have just wishful thinking i am soooo tired of being bald has anyone used biotine for growth of hair kelli hi everyone and welcome peach struggling through tax this week aches everywhere but now only two lots left last one if all goes well 30th dec then 3 or 4 weeks of rads and tabs just feel like crying most of the time we all sound a bit desperate at the moment love to all julia x liz luckily your breast cancer was caught at a very early stage and is not an aggressive type i would definitely keep the 1 ovary as going into early menopause is not beneficial to the rest of your body aromotase inhibitors are only for postmenopausal women while tamoxifen is for women who still get periods with tamoxifen the estrogen gets blocked from the cancer cells but not from everywhere else so your bones and other areas are not deprived of it been on tamoxifen for just over 3 years now and the side effects come and go most of them are gone right now hot flashes were worse in the first year or two but now they are barely there other effects like joint pains dry eyes and difficulty with orgasms have also improved the onlly thing still struggling with is frequent insomnia but i believe this could be caused just as much by the fact that recently gone through natural menopause still trying to find a solution for this problem you know how tamoxifen will affect you until you try it it takes several weeks to build up in your system so some side effects may not show up immediately if you find it terrible even after giving the side effects time to build up and then settle down again you could always stop taking it and then they would go away so be scared to try it xrayalli sorry to hear struggling some but hope you start feeling better soon jules i am currently getting my 4th weekly taxol infusion and so far have been getting the day after infusion for each dose because my wbc counts have been low so you should be good for your next infusion if they gave you a neutropenia shot i missed a weekly infusion yet and i get the shot to get my counts up your counts should get up in time and be feeling better soon dblmocha i have been on tamoxifen since april 15th of this year and also was having insomnia mild hot flashes aches and inmy lower legs calves shins and feet been taking magnesium citrate powder at night before bed mixed with hot water tastes like a hot raspberry lemonade till dissolved the brand i take is the vitamin version of natural calm theirs is called calm zone magnesium which is magnesium carbonate citric acid i started with 1 teaspoon of the powder mixed with about cup of water and it worked really well helping me sleep wiping out the hot flashes keeping the leg foot pains at bay and then even helps with keeping me great benefit this week though increased the dosage to 2 teaspoons in cup water because i started getting the leg foot pains back this has done the trick and i feel well again and have been able to sleep through the night unwoken by pain this is at least what works for me i take any sleeping aids or pain killers or anything else although i take curcumin turmeric capsules for purposes and my oncologist says thatthey may also be helping to keep the hot flashes in check i hope this information can be helpful dblmocha robo 47 i know how you feel about the brows mine are coming back but since ihadextremely curly hair beforechemo not only is my hair coming inalmost straight finally something good to come out of this disaster but my lashesand brows are as well i have to curl my lashes andafter shaping my eyebrows since i was a teenager had to start from scratch theyare also coarser now i did manage to keep quite a bit of my hair by using cranial ice helmets but the zoladex and chemo taking out my estrogen managed to thin my hair a bit more than i think it would have just with taxol alone i really want to colour my hair but was worried it would fall out dragonfly what a situation you are in when i had the frozen shoulder i used pain meds in addition to tylenol with codeine was very helpful joint problems can be related to estrogen depletion i did not experience them with tamoxifen and dont know if it is a known side effect of it but joint pain is a major side effect of aromatase inhibitors which i am on now in the 2 years i have been on them the pain has migrated from joint to joint its weird it was awful when i was on arimidex but my onc switched me to aromasin and it has gotten a lot has not disappeared entirely i agree with voracious your doctor should not ignore your pain issues if he thinks interfact with herceptin why not pain killers 2 weeks into using tamox and still fiddling with it to make se more manageable so far insomnia exhaustion and joint pain are the big ones however i am taking glucosamine for joints and playing with the tamox time so the exhaustion comes when i should be sleeping i believe the se will diminish with time i understand how it is a personal decision tho ironic tamoxifen is a drug of choice for body builders using steroids and they pay big time for it can you imagine i started femara 6 years ago when it was only available as name brand i went to letrozole when it became available in the generic form have only taken femara letrozole i was already osteopenia years before starting on femara and have progressed to osteoporosis but that was to be expected as i have a huge family hx on both sides of family it is being kept under control on fosamax alendronate also i had gone through natural menopause when i was 44 my cholesterol levels have not changed since long before ibc dx tx my total levels is and has been high but this is because my hdl good cholesterol is very high but ldl bad cholesterol is well within normal level ya betcha i do have aches and pains i had arthritis in my upper back for many years thanks to a lot of injuries from years as a jumper rider and just generally being very active in sports prior to taking femara letrozole again it has gotten worse in the years i was 63 when dx am now 69l so would have anyway have some other aches and pains but again nothing new just feeling the old injuries from throughout my life and getting older i switched from aromasin to arimidex in august 2012 after being on aromasin since feb 2012 and tamoxifen since august 2010 i have hamstring cramps from both but are better when i stretch and exercise another issue i have is reoccurrent chemo threw me into menopause and i have has 3 in 2 months i am having a cystogram this week ct scan of abdomen and pelvis showed possible remnants of kidney stones but nothing else if i passed stones i sure know it i am also noting i am less bloated and have lost weight on aromasin without really putting much effort into it seems when i was in aromasin i loose weight with trying rayofsun just wait till it happens if it does when i did taxol my 2nd chemo i shaved my hair in anticipation and it all fall out it did thin moral of the story shave your head you could go with an easy short do hi jayne i had 18 doses of taxol in 2007 and am now on xeloda have had some neuropathy in my feet and hands all that time it was worst towards the end of my 18 on taxol but they decided to continue with it as only affecting the toes with a little bit of odd sensation in the ball of the foot did improve in my months off chemo but as soon as i started on xeloda came back what was recommended this time and has kept it at manageable levels is acupuncture evidently there is no published research really on this but the centre where i was referred have looked at figures of people treated and feel that about 2 out of 3 people i think benefit and that if there was going to be benefit you would know after sessions i have been taught now to and give myself acupuncture in the legs every 10 days or so do it in my arm because of lymphoedema it really does make a difference to the numbness and to my balance which is also affected when the feet are bad cos of lack of feedback evidently my onc was very sceptical it was the macmillan nurse who suggested it so you might need to convince some people worth a go take care kay x hi liza glad you get a kick out of my posts if we laugh at our situation might as well give up right though truth be told that thought has crossed my mind way way too many times of late sigh but thank you for the advice on the cymbalta as luck ould have it my shrink just today wednesday wrote me a script for that as i told her a few months ago that effexor was not changing my moods at all and i still felt like a useless piece of dog poop smeared all over the sidewalk sssooo she slowly took my down on the effexor and on thursday i will start taking the cymbalta and it would be such a bonus if one of the side effects was wanting to have sex again lol my dear dear sweet lovely man alfred has been such an incredible lover in all senses of the word he said that he really think too much about having intercourse cause he knows it hurts me so get no pleasure from it and no all mine lol of course helped with other parts of my body since the vagina the only part that works on a man thank goodness oh oh oh i unwittingly bought three tubs of sensual chocolate with applicator here i thought i was buying chocolate powder and a powder puff nope basically milk chocolate syrup with the stupidest hard edged plasted knifey thing like a spread knife well we gave it the good old try first off make sure yo have time to take a shower afterwards lol also tie any hair you have up in a bun or somethiing behind your head if giving um head as you will have chocolate sauce all over yourself face up nose in hair etc oh and after that experiment we decided he was due for a trim out came the professional hair cutting cissors sp and he now has a very neatly trimmed area from top to bottom so to speak lol but be very very very careful of course omg i found the most wonderful kit at walgreens the othereday for women who like to trim though that was not the wording they used but the description of where the trimming would be happening was pretty conscise even has a very delicate moustache trimmer or at least looks like the same as hubby has for from what i could understand a complete smooth shave even around the clit me not too sure about putting anything snipping or shearing near my clit thanks though i would be very willing to let alfred do whatever artistic design he would like to trim off the bush did i say that never omg sure some of you ladies have gone the entire shaving route a freind of mine gave me a product called coochie cream which is supposed to help even the most sensitive skin have a smooth bumpless painless shave well so i lathered myself up with this stuff and very carefully shaved and shaved and shaved but darnit the skin still felt like it smooth so i continued to shave and shave the next day well i could not move forget about peeing forget about undies what i had thought was not smooth was actually skin and i had shaved off a layer of skin this was a few years ago as a welcome home surprise for alfred as been gone away for a week working and women did it backfire and bigtime forget about that night it was weeks before i could have a romp in the hay bummer ok so claiire back to cymbalta thank you again for your very timely advice i know it takes a while to get accustomed to a new medication and as long as it does not do to me what wellbuterin did literally make me pass out anywhere anywhen even while bringing a spoon of food to my mouth as well as other nasty nasty side effects which wow they are only now learning about what so confused i thought the ten years of human trials were supposed to discover these things right then why did it take me only three days to figure it out idiots claiire i had such a horrible time with taxotere primarily due to having just had a wretched spinal fusion where my l4 l5 s1 nerves we so damaged that once the taxotere was injecte into the mix i was literally having glass ground up constantly inside my feet and could not walk same with not putting pressure on feet but not as bad glad that i seem to be one of the few who has had such a horrible terrible time with taxotere and happy that you only had some effects on two of you toes oh hey did you lose your toe finger nails while on taxotere i lost 20 nails all told hurt a bit thankfully as they were well just dead and new nails had already started to grow underneath the old dead nail i still have two the two big toenails that never fully fell off and now a year later they are almost fully grown out i can still lift the nail away from the toe just to freak people out if i wanted to hee hee 1 okey dokey off to bed love to all hugs to all and i shall continue to wait to see what other women have to say about the size issue if anyone wants to join in on it lol oh again brain has failed me but someone said that for them size does matter hey either way whatever floats your boat right ladies me a clit woman while i will admit that in better times when dh had gotten me ssssooo hot ___ a fourposter bed we get on our sides sort of at a 90 degree angle i think bad ith math and i would basically slam into him while he was still twiddling my clit and pinch one of my nipples so hard it would fall off practically well if the neighbors hear us it would be because they are deaf lol oh i really really want those days nites back so damn much this is just so wrong wrong wrong once again i sign off to all with love and hugs to all my sisters as well as their partners connierc hello all i am belatedly joining you gals better late than never i guess i am 39 2 small kids and was diagnosed in august bilateeral mastectomy and now chemo possible radiation followed by tamoxifen started my first of 8 chemo treatments second is this thursday every 2 weeks a c four sessions followed by neualsta shot taxol 4 sessions i am taking emend iv before chemo then days and decadron days 2x day anyone else on this regimen i came home and was horribly sick something we expect at all then most of the weekend was spent in a fog not really much getting out of bed or eating i would day 7 was when i finally felt clear headed the nausea was bad but cannot stand the fogginess drives me nuts did anyone find anything that helped i am willing to try different anti nausea meds took ativan at night and compazine in as twice all the weekend also what eyebrow lash gel are you all ordering so many would love to know if one works better than another is the onco type test just for neg lymph nodes i had one affected good luck to you all oxox kfprev i finished 6 tx of tac on october 31st it is natural to feel anxious but the experience will most likely be much better than you are anticipating my first tx was very uneventful about 3 hours with an iv administering the meds and then the chem the adrimician is administered by the nurse into your iv with the other 2 they just hang the bag your first couple of times will take a bit longer as they administer the taxotere at a slower rate the first couple of times just to make sure you have any allergic reaction which is rare but possible but really it was very easy i watched a movie on my ipod there are lots of threads with advice about se check those out here are some of the things i found helpful rink lots of waterrest and push yourself to do too mucheat alot of small meals i never went more than a couple of hours without eating something an empty stomach seemed to bring on the nausea i kept ginger snap cookies by my bed and if i woke up in the night or when i first work up in the morning sometimes i felt a little nausea i called it my chemo morning sickness but if i ate a cookie and laid back down for 5 minutes i felt better biotene mouthwash and toothpast helps prevent mouth sores i used it often along with something my dentist gave me called mi paste and never had a problem with mouth sores good luck hello ladies linda sooo glad you have finished the poison me too are heading for number 5 monday the dreaded tax only just about got over the diarrhea sludge gob urine infection lardy dardy dary dah wating for my ct scan results should get them tomorrow have to see the surgeon and the onc hopefully will have my operation soon going to ask for a ssm skin saving mastecomy then they dont have to take anything from anywhere else and i can have it done to the other good boobie so less chance of any badies coming back yipppee ooohhh there is an upside going to ask for bigger ones too be greedy 1 size bigger is fine no jordan for me glad to hear everyone relatively ok speak soon luvs all round barbara xxxx the good news is there are some alternatives for the vaginal atrophy and sex issues scream cream is talked about extensively it out in the stage iv forum my naturopath recommended hyaluronic acid for atrophy being used in europe these are creepy drugs no two ways about it my list ranges from hair thinning blurry vision to chronic lower back pain only a year in and sometimes i truly wonder what four more years will bear most days i can just forget about it but hardly without ses i am more than miffed at the notion our friend alaska angel was the exception according to the nurse ha my sexuality definitely got and absurd to me they would suggest otherwise with hormonal treatment after all the hormones that facilitate the process duh this is to say nothing of chemo a whole other ball of wax more good news though be glad you are where you are vast swaths of the world deem female sexuality a huge taboo i know from personal experience many if not most of my lady friends in second and third world countries have no concept of their own pleasure and would just suffer through with discomfort as part of duty at least we can be plain and in some cases discuss it with partners decided to take it one step at a time tamox is cutting my risk 8 not taking unnecessary chances on the other hand vaginal atrophy bone loss and other complications also have very serious consequence rguiff as for the fsh and estrogen as confused as you but quite the opposite 47 fsh and 90 estradiol the only thing i can figure is the tamoxifen is causing high circulating estradiol which of course new studies indicate contributes to my chance of recurrence which probably cuts way into the efficacy of tamoxifen in the course of my treatment i have found there are no easy answers particularly for those of us really straddling and in the grey zone i am ready to get on with my life but i stress so much about all the difficult choices i was on tamoxifen for 2 years then switched to femara femara gave me bad joint pain but managed to hobble thrugh it for another 3 years at the time was given celexa for hot flashes and it did help some after a few months effexor at that time was not on my insurance formulary fast forward 9 years later and am now on aromisin s e not so bad but the night sweats were horrendous and waking times a night working either onc prescibed gaboplentin usually given for seizure disorders ha but night sweats are gone i take an ativan at bedtime and only wake once a night to pee i hate taking all these meds meds for ca meds for side effects of ca drugs meds for side effects of side effects but for me the relief is worth a better quality of life everyone reacts so differently to these stupid drug combos and i think it might take some tweaking to find what works for you hi dan i have had 3 rounds of herceptin only and have been lucky to experience no side effects i feel so much better since stopping taxotere and carboplatin your general malaise could be caused by either herceptin or tamoxifen my oncologist told me most people tolerate herceptin really well and generally have no side effects when did you start the tamoxifen if you started them together you could talk to your oncologist about briefly stopping the tamoxifen to see if you feel better without it also are you having your heart function monitored if your heart function is abnormal that could make you feel run down as well i hope you can figure out what is causing you to feel lousy it sure does seem like you take one drug to fight the cancer then you have to take another to treat the side effects from the first drug i got peripheral neuropathy from the chemo drugs and am now on lyrica for that it seems to be helping after only a few days on anastrozole but need to take prolia injections to prevent fractures it seems to be never ending good luck dan laura hi everyone i did 5 years of tamoxifen and now have been on femara for 7 months it is causing constipation but the big thing is my eyes i get dizzy when i use the computer only and it lasts all day my eyes are sooo dry and i got drops and salve from the eye doctor as long as i use the computer i am okay uuuuuggggi was good for 3 days as i was for 5 minutes each day today i was on for 30 minutes and my eyes are a mess anyone else have this i be much if this keeps and le hugs jinky edi hope you are back in bed luvmy i think anyone with tomotoes growing here in there back yards would have had them blown away for tomatoe sauce its that windy today i went and picked up ds and the wind was pushing me to his classroom lucky got this extra weight on me to hold me down thought i was going to be mary poppins without the umbrella websister i actually phoned my onc today for the peace of mind as i was literally going out of my mind with anxiety and worry he said sciatica sounds very clear on the butt thigh pain he said even without the bum pain i can get the lower back and thigh pain with regards to my headache swollan gland and congestion sounds all too familiar of sinus i am however booked in to see my gp this evening so he can just check me over and if antibiotics is recommended i can start on that onc said that because we have all this poison or bodies can do crazy things after we finish with tx he did ease my mind a little i asked if scans were necessary as i am going in for my liver scan on the 9th may and he said no i asked re blood work to be done and he said no never the less i am going to get my blood work checked the standard chemo ones they do and see if my liver works back in action after the cmf stuff the reason i phoned my onc also wasto see if i should have another zoladex injection as i stopped last month being my last one before surgery however because surgery is not scheduled for min 2 weeks he told me i get 2 week minimum notice that i should start tamoxifen sound like they are the same as zoladex hot flushes etc but still in two states of mind starting it do i i arghhhhh decisions he told me to start it and we can in my appt with him in june i really hope your back gets better before next thursday so you have anything to talk with mo for fingers crossed for you ds enjoyed grandparents dropping him off this morning my dad was so happy that zac gave him lots of kisses and cuddles as they were leaving he does that with my mum all the time mum and i went to pick him up and he ran straight to his nanna yeh thanks ds worry about your dm lol will have some me time now and watch a bit of tv house is clean laundry is done and ds having a snooze love to all x hello i just wanted to say that i was dreading it too but i just finished 4 x a c and 4 x taxol for me it was not that bad main problem i had was just tiredness and hair loss not really anything else i wish you the best hugs as some of you will remeber i had the rare serious allergic reaction to neulasta while going thru the a c part of my chemo well today was 1 taxol and did fine with the first but crashed on the benadyrl benadryl of all things they use that to block reactions not cause them they what i got was 50mgs thru my port and was told i would probably be tired well i started to get very drowsy then i could feel my heart pumping then started with the shakes felt very nervous and agitated and started having what i think were panic attacks a sudden rush of fear terrible i sat there thinking this is just too intesnse so got the nurse they took my bp and good lord it was heart rate was 110 premed was and 85 they flushed me for gave me mg ativan i stared to come down to earth i even focus or stand up and then they started the taxol you can imagine i was a wreck getting that taxol and they were wachting me like a hawk lol feel much better now 8 hours later can you imagine breeze thru taxol and react the benadryl go figure wonder if the dose was just too high for me and would have done ok with 25mgs but they decided i should try claratin tonight and forget the benedryl for now and then premed at home the day of taxol with 1 claratin hope that works any thoughts thanks for your support as always debi so sorry to hear about your lung complication so sorry having such a time with this let alone having to do the chemo be praying that your drs can get this resolved for you so you can resume your treatments carolyn how many taxol have you had sorry to hear the bone pain is so unbearable i had some knee pain with my first one which was relieved somewhat with aleve but hoping that do not cause more pain also i can sympathize about the dh problem mine was a total butt head the month of january and i spent the whole time in tears every day he finally admitted he was still angry and scared about me doing the chemo this whole process is so stressful on families hang in there pm me if you want to discuss further hope everyone else is doing ok hugs cathy melanie_ann have you talked to a gynecologist about the lack of periods my fertility specialist said that most will get their periods back in 6 months and most of the rest will get it back within 12 months of finishing chemo i think an exact science to this but i would definitely talk to your doctor if you get it back in the next few months i did want to add that i did not get a zoladex shot to put my ovaries to sleep and i have heard that it can take longer if you did get the shot so if you did then it could just take a bit longer and another thing is with tamoxifen you can have irregular cycles so that of course help matters so when did you finish radiation i am sure it will feel good to say that got 1 year of tamoxifen under your belt i believe already been on it for 3 months 5 years still seems like forever but 2 may just fly right by oh and as for the hair i think also going to have to cut the back really soon getting close to having longer hair than my brother again of course his is really short courtp how did the biopsy go did they say when get your results i know the waiting is hard but you have found the right place for support rosaa really hard when you are experiencing so many changes that affect the way you look all at once for me it was hard every time i was leading up to one of those things like my mastectomy i started to freak out closer to that date then it came and went and i had to focus on getting physically well and i quickly realized that only me and my husband and all of the medical professionals are going to see that imperfect now most people have no clue unless i tell them and then i started chemo and i had a crapload of anxiety leading up to the day i was losing all my hair and decided it was time to shave it i tried to have fun with it as much as one can and just cut it myself a week or so before figured i go wrong since i was going to lose it anyways and then i cut it to different lengths the days i shaved it to see what it might look like growing in i felt so much better after shaving it because it can be traumatizing having it come out in clumps and i frankly it was exhausting picking up the hair everywhere it turns out i have a good shaped head so i looked better bald than i ever thought i would i guess sharing this because if you set your expectations low for how you will look you can only be satisfied with the result and in the end i think when you are stripped of your hair and your breast you realize how much deeper your importance is that looks are not the most important thing in life i like to joke with my friends who talk about their bad hair days saying they should shave their head too since you have very minimal maintenance that way the hair is coming back the boob will not but it be long before no one on the street will have a clue what been through you will get to that point too mena when i started on arimidex i was freezing all the time have hot flashes but because of mostly pain pain pain my mo changed me to femara pain worse then aromisin exemestane which still taking not cold with either this ai hot flashes hot flashes hot flashes and just a tad less pain tried amitryptiline nortryptiline and am now on effexor for the hot flashes they are supposed to help with neuropathy too but though each helped some at first after a couple of months my neuropathy and hot flashes just start getting worse going to ask my pcp when i go in next month if we can try gabapentin next i hear it works better sometimes and has less side effects sorry to hear your cold all the time it was a really warm fall here when i was on arimidex and just get warm when i mentioned it to my mo he said not the arimidex it causes hot flashes but i think we were the exception to that groundhog i wish somebody would have suggested to me to use emla cream when i had my snb in may 2008 my surgeon did 4 injections the first 3 were not bad at all the 4th one hurt like hell i am having another axillary node dissection with this surgery but i was really glad when my surgeon told me i would not have to have snb this time the emla cream works great whenever my port is accessed sure it will help a lot during snb as well wondering how many of you have already had chemo after my diagnosis of idc in april 2008 i had a lumpectomy sentinal node biopsy and axillary node dissection i then had adriamycin cytoxin taxol and herceptin all of those are infusions and then i had 30 radiation treatments and continued on herceptin after rads then i was diagnosed with ibc in june 2009 and as a result of that i just finished 6 months of oral chemo xeloda and tykerb but i will stay on the tykerb indefinitely my ibc actually started while i was taking herceptin and having rads but we just thought the rash and sweling etc were a side effect of my radiation treatments i was so burned and blistered from rads that there was no reason to be suspicious of a rash and swelling so i actually dx until june now mx and another axillary node dissection to take more nodes that they get the first time i recently returned from another trip to md anderson and had another pet ct and it was still all clear hopefully after this surgery i will remain forever in 2 more months it will be 2 full years since my initial diagnosis and since that time i have been in chemo enough just curious about the rest of you girls yes i had and still have a hoarse voice it was most significant the few days after avastin treatment it isnt significant but its still there a bit some people have commented on this buti dont mind it that much but coupled with the sinus stuff i think i sound like i have a cold at times my eyes still overly water periodically also but i think that is the taxol ok i go for staging for rads tomorrow though dont think i start for another 2 3 weeks as dr said two weeks minimum after last taxol finished taxol last thursday but takes time to get out of thesystem also speaking of rashes i had a rash outbreak and itching on my hands and lower arms today red blothcy and little bumps it is more than dry skin i used sarna lotion and it helped hello i hope someone can help me as i am in absolute bits i am 2 years post breast cancer treatment stage 2 b 3a er and have been on tamoxifen for 18 months lymphs were positive and removed i have just gone for a 2 year oncology check as recently had shingles in my lower back area i mentioned i had extreme pain in hip and back area the onc ordered a pet scan i was devastated to hear that there is a suspicious maximum uptake in the l5 vertebrae i then did an mri and it is showing a 2cm area compatible and most probable bony metastasis i am just so scared and completely in bits and have fallen apart i am going to have a bone biopsy on monday which will let us know exactly what we are dealing with are there an cases of false positives on mri for bone metastasis i heard it can happen on pet which is why we did the mri of the lumbar spine has anyone ever gone through this only to find they do not have bone metastasis if it was an infection or arthritis would the mri recognize it as such this l5 area is to the left of my spine the shingles area was to the right i am just wondering if there is any hope that it might not be metastasis and clinging to hope of inflammation or anything else but mets thank you in advance log in to post a reply hi i was on tch x6 finishing tc a year ago in apr 2010 and finishing h in dec 2010 my nails are still kind of a wreck discolored brittle splitting and lifting not actually lost any nails but surprised they still have issues this far out anyone else like this been taking biotin any other suggestions thanks jb taxol is like night and day easier compared to ac for me on the weeks i just get taxol i feel like a normal human being on carboplatin weeks a little more achy and fatigued but still nothing like ac hopefully taxol is just as easy on you janis i did that combo for a year and yeah compared to taxotere it is sort of a breeze however the side effects are still difficult i got the trots under control pretty quick luckily still instead of going 1 or 2 times a day it was like times a day my biggest complaint was the finger splitting and nail issues i had two toe surgeries and usually 6 of 10 fingers had bandaids on them most of the time definitely sensitive to the sun and warm in general i am totally a sun lover so i would sit out in the sun and itch like crazy i had the zits mostly on my arms they would pop out about an hour after i took it and then be sort of faded by the next afternoon then pop out all over again amazing though after being off tykerb for like four months i would still get those damn zits on occasion in the evenings i wait to be done with tykerb but i think if i had to do it again i could handle it you get to keep your hair and that is good sure is a sucky way to lose weight hoping it is totally blasting your cancer and our good friend herceptin jennifer for my lovely taxotere burned am on antibiotics so not to get cellulitis or any other infection also i am taking 2 ibuprofen every hours if i take it on time it helps alot i got a prescription for oxycodeine if that stops working i also keep lotion on it can add hydrocortizone cream but gotten to store to get it right now the skin is sooo tight most of the time i just want to cry because i do anything i hope i can get the last treatment on time in the mean time i pray for no infections or colds renee i too was also told in the beginning not to take note of the markers because they will spike i know this might sound like a contradiction but xeloda is my favorite treatment by far done femara 16 months ned faslodex no response and then abraxane avastin months megace 3 months no response the only s e i am experiencing is gastric issues i e nausea a little bit of the trots which is better than the terrible time i had with a a and better than the joint issues i had with femara it seems like the 3rd and 4th day of treatment are the toughest and then i start to feel fantastic so give it a chance i know hard hi jackie are you doing fec t at the same time i am doing 3 cycles of fec followed by 3 cycles of t dense dose every two weeks i just finished my second round of fec and it been so bad i took emend for the nausea expensive little pills but sure seem to do the trick coupled with decadron for 3 days the worst side effects were sleeplessness and constipation knowing that the second time around i was armed with sleeping pills and started miralax 3 days beforehand adding stool softeners after my treatment and was able to keep all of that under control also doing neupogen injections 4x per cycle and noticed any ill effects from that it sounds like it may not be as harsh as neulasta but there are more injections required luckily my husband helps me out there and we do them at home i know about the t part that may have a different effect on me but the fec has been bearable always good to be prepared for the worst but hope for the best and be sure to psyche yourself up not out i began 8 rounds of avastin with carboplatin and am now on round 4 of 12 of abraxane taxol abraxane every other week of treatment my only isue is that putting on a lot of weight as if the hair loss and scars from surgery were not enough of a reminder i never lost my hair during the avastin carbo treatements but starting to fall out now with the abraxane taxol one other side effect i really care for is the bloody nose i seem to get several times a week since being diagnosed with cancer 2007 i have put on 25lbs between the hyterectomy and now the chemo drugs but alive hello i am using rosemary oil ofr my hair growth but just found out from my naturopath that 2 concentration of rosemary extract given for 3 weeks can inactivate estrogen according to him rosemary acts as tamoxifen anybody heard about it i cannot take tamoxifen due to clotting problems but maybe rosemary hi sherry i had a chemotherapy mastectomy and radiotherapy i started femara in september and found that i got dizzy lightheaded around mid late morning i decided to try taking it at night time before bed and this seemed to solve the problem i also take vitamin d and calcium and started doing gentle yoga to help strengthen my bones especially now it is winter and we get no sunlight to speak of i do feel a bit stiff at times but this goes away when i move around i get fatigue and by mid afternoon i feel i have to take it easy and not try to do anything which is too energetic i think the fatigue is partly because we have been through so much and our bodies are still healing from the onslaught of all the treatments it is good to try to pace yourself as i think if you have had major surgery it can take a year or so to get your normal stamina back if not longer depending on your situation all best wishes harebell taxol 3 for me i had to take a week off because i had strep throat and it is the hardest thing to make myself go back in the chair i am starting to feel normal again and i am so scared and sad that i have only just begun t i have been having second thoughts and have decided to finish with my treatment as planned i cant live with what ifs i have also recently gone through a break up fml i need some inspiration some hobbies some thing to make this time go faster and easier it has become very lonely and boring around here i am moving into a different house so that will keep me occupied for a bit i try and sleep 12 hours a night so my time is cut in half this may not be an option for you but throw it out there and maybe worth running by your onc due to pre existing joint issues i was able to get abraxane usually reserved for stage 4 instead of taxotere steroids are not required for abraxane i did have the chemo nausea but the emend worked great for that i do hope you can resolve your difficult situation this journey can be so damn difficult god bless ellen ah thinking back to first chemo that was scary each facility is different the first one i went to i could bring movies nothing that might offend anyone and they popped it in the vcr and we watched it another that i went to had tvs at each station but i never did watch i mostly just read or talked to folks who came with me i remember always being cold partly because during the adriamycin they had us chew on ice chips the whole time to avoid mouth sores i remember being freaked out even tho they warned me when my urine was pink because of the drug i remember being tired from the benadryl but being afraid to sleep lest i drool or snore i got over that i also brought snacks along to eat as it seemed like a long time i was in there right get into a groove and go by pretty quickly well in relative terms nl it sounds like just having a blast good on you as we say in texas mary hope the house is still standing things are good here hot but hey my remodeled bathroom is almost done and her plumbing problems appear to be fixed whew paula

and acupuncture i have started this topic on behalf of new user alex kind regards forum host breast cancer care hello i started tamoxifen just over 3 months ago and havent had a day or night without hot flushes night sweats since do anything for a decent nights sleep will these ever cease or am will i have to put up with it for the next 5 years also has anyone tried acupuncture for hot flushes alex ps just gone back to work after 9 months of therapy tired but loving being back hi alexposted on 07 pm bcc host profile reply report delete in my case the acupuncture did work i started my tamoxifen in june 04 and started acupuncture last year def worth a try glad your enjoying being back at work karen i never had andriamycin and as far as i know my heart is fine carol i had the same combination you are having cytoxin and taxotere i had infusion on a thursday after school and was fine that evening and all the next day even went to work on saturday i felt rocky and on sunday i felt pretty awful i was then rocky again on monday and felt pretty fine by tuesday i was told that my combination was overall easier than andimycin i undertsand the hair issue that was just such a hard time i felt relieved to get over that hump you may be shedding a lot prior to fallout and that gets very annoying i hope you like your wig i hated mine but nearly everyone else i know thought it looked great on me have a nice day susan i had a complete hysterectomy when i was 48 diagnoses with dcis breast cancer in 2011 so definitely was post menopausal they put me on tamoxifin not arimidex last year i have been on tamoxifin for a year and one month main side effects for me are the hot flashes night sweats but i was kinda getting those after hysterectomy a little joint pain but yoga and exercise helps for me good luck my cancer was also estrogen positive sue d dear kirby i know what you mean my diagnosis was in september 09 as well done 21 taxol avastin and am scheduled for three more making my total 24 my onc is then talking about avastin only and maybe tamoxifen since it worked well the first go round unlike you physically i feel pretty crappy nausea fatigue no hair and now no voice and chronic chemo cough been stable with a little regression but nothing earth shattering i think it was elaine d that got me to thinking that this was okay i was pretty down for awhile but now i realize that my liver function is fine and still pretty healthy just the treatment kicking my butt so without chemo am i doomed for progression what a balancing act sick and tired too literally sorry i just joined your chorus and have anything worthwhile to add to help wait here with you until the wonderful women weigh in lc i have any hair loss at all in fact i took xeloda taxol and fac and darn it if in 12 weeks my hair start growing back and looked pretty good until it fell out again with the fac the biggest thing with xeloda to watch for is the hand foot syndrome sounds worse than it is your hands and feet may swell and become itchy or tender or start peeling you just have to tell your doctor what is happening and then your dose will be adjusted compared to other drugs this one bad at all usually taken for 2 weeks then a week off then continues like that for maybe 9 to 12 weeks at a time no bad taste in your mouth no nausea or other nasty stuff even worry about it nothing like what probably been through before dosage varies i think i started out at 1500 twice a day and ended up on 2000 twice a day after adjusting for some sore feet and hands their website has the recommended dosage but every doctor approaches that differently daughters are so sweet just their thoughtfulness had me in tears glad you were just dehydrated but it truly is so much crap to deal with and on day too so glad feeling better and i hope that your next treatments are been through so much your onc is so proactive andt betting the pain is from the mast had rib soreness too and am worried because increased can taxol do that going to mention it to my onc on friday also mentioned my shoulder and lower back pain i feel like he might perceive me as a hypocondriac but i need to get over that insecurity cuz sh t we all know it now had that same reaction when the phone rang when i was expecting my initial biopsy results and the pet scan results my heart just stopped each time the phone rang and i even have caller id finally gotten over white coat syndrome re by blood pressure would always go high after having it taken every week before treatment test results seem to ongoing good news for all us jewels luck with the rad rehearsal and then the real thing i might be joining your may rads group but still not sure when get rescheduled to with dry run hope you hit too much traffic to and from news about feeling better walking and having the neuropathy go away i have just one more taxol friday and when i walked today after work i really felt the tingling in my toes i want my feet to just go numb all of a sudden and fall down i talked with my nurse today who said it should go away soon after the last treatment i have nose hairs yuk but still loosing eyebrows terrible at drawing them on and my 3 or 4 remaining lashes look so pathetic with mascara white fuzz increasing on head to about inch with some dark i really agree about exercise i feel so much better after i walk partly i want to get exercise but for me being outside is so important need some help with arimidex side effects spoke with my oncologist and just went off it cold turkey joint pain is so bad i can hardly walk they put me into menopause when they did the double masectomy then lupron shots now the armidex my mother had breast cancer and died from uterine cancer i believe the tamoxifen and fumara had something to do with this so i will not take them am considering taking nothing had a hysterectomy 3 mos after breast surgery when will this muscle and joint pain stop anyone else chose to take nothing so glad to have found this thread my last infusion of cmf was march 15 3 months ago thought that by now i would feel normal but even close i went on arimidex april 15 2 months ago tired and aching and depressed as anything all i do is eat and i excercize so i keep gaining weight which is the worst thing for recurrence my daughter wanted to go to europe with me this next week and i just do it depressed no stamina etc the spirit is willing but the body allow it fear of recurrence is constant i never touch the remaining breast because so scared but i did tonight and felt some awful lumps that have me in a tizzy took a xanax to get through my get up and go has gotten up and went i just pray the cancer has too i was 41 when i began chemo herceptin treatments in 2002 that were completed in 2003 last regular period was since then 4 episodes of extremely heavy bleeding and a few interim instances of spotting 1st episode resulted in hypothyroid diagnosis next 2 no diagnosis other than the menopause homonal balance issue is not an exact science which i do understand however i have now been bleeding for a month the 1st 2 weeks flow equivalent to a regular period and the 3rd week extremely heavy my pcv dropped from 45 to 36 in that time and the dr put me on progesterone which was to stop the bleeding until pills were finished at which time i would have a withdrawal bleed i have been on the progesterone 2 10 mg tablets a day for a week and the bleeding has slowed but not stopped and developed a severe headache lasted 4 days now the dr wants me to finish the progesterone and have the withdrawal blled which he believes will solve the problem but if i insist on doing something else the next step would be an ablation i had an ultrasound that showed fibroids cysts and an endometrial biopsy that was negative the dr has also suggested i may need some estrogen therapy which i am not certain i want given my history of breast cancer thanks in advance for any assistance hi all tina my tumour size was 7cm as well but it was not 1 tumour but what they called a multi focal area of approximately 7cm with the biggest tumour about 26mm found this out recently as the hospital now send letters after each clinic appointment with details of diagnosis i wish i had a crystal ball as well i have never asked for stastics of my prognosis as i have to believe that i will be on the right side of them tax se have wained just the horrible taste in my mouth slight numbness in my fingers and the weird eye movement thing which obviously sends my anxiety paranonia levels into overdrive also have got another period 1 week after the last going to ring my bcn on monday as i worry about both just came back from a barbeque at a work friends it was lovely to have an afternoon with no kids left oh to look after them still face a drink though so no hangover hope you all have a good weekend love cat been experiencing very bad side effects for about 5 of the 6 weeks been taking tamoxifen surprised i typically do well with medications the worst is the eye trouble i now have blurry vision floaters and achy watery eyes getting cramps in my legs at night which never experienced before except when i was pregnant super irritable and i have pelvic pain and pressure that goes from annoying to very intense at various times of the day i have grade 1 bc with no node involvement a 6 chance of recurrence by oncotype score with tamoxifen according to the cancer math calculator i have a chance of death from cancer in 15 years if i take tamoxifen very similar to the oncotype result an chance if i if the side effects improve in the next month or if the eye exam i have scheduled for next week comes up bad going off of tamoxifen not worth destroying my life over a decrease of when i have a 92 chance of being fine without the drug youngwithbc if it makes you feel better been on the tamoxifen for 3 months now and am doing fine the only negative side effects had are my menstrual cycles have been a bit irregular and my fingernails seem weaker though be sure from the tami on the plus side been sleeping better and have less cyclical breast pain noticed any hair thinning and lost weight deliberately but it seem to be coming off any harder than it did before tamoxifen i get to start chemo on may 28th so i guess this is where i should be i was diagnosed with dcis and idc hr pr her i will be getting 6 cycles of fec followed with 4 cycles of t every 3 weeks i will be getting aloxi zofran and emend for nausea plus have the emend zofran and phenergan to take at home after treatment will also get injection of neulasta after each treatment it has been a long road to get to this point had biopsy lumpectomy with snb lymph node dissection was so glad to get rid of the drains and port insertion on i have also had a pet scan ct scans and muga scans all surgeries went well up to the port insertion had to do it twice 1st attempt the surgeon get it where he wanted it so he tried the jugular plus i went into tachycardia during the procedure xray showed catheter to be in a smaller vein so it was back to or 2nd attempt was successful in the subclavian vein site is still sore but that is to be expected also had a small puncture to left lung that has cleared up my oncologist was going to start the chemo this week but decided to wait an extra week to give me some time to heal been trying to decide when to go get my hair cut before of after the 1st treatment i will get a wig but will probably only wear it on select occasions other times i will wear a scarf or hat hubby says that wearing a hat or scarf is like showing my badge of courage and that fighting this fight is something i should be proud to show he is going to shave his head and have a small pink ribbon tattoo put on the side of his head to show support for me know when i will go back to work i work in a nursing home so the risk of infection is very high my oncologist would prefer that i work until at least after the first few treatments fortunatly i have short and long term insurance but i already miss working when i do go back it will probably be a desk job with very minimal resident contact my story now i am just waiting for the first treatment runnergirl i hope your day 1 is going well mine has gone without incident so far taking much longer than i thought though labs and was two hours taxotere cause any issues except for a metallic taste briefly and i just finished the carboplatin which made me a tad tired now onto 90 minutes of herceptin when all is said and done my time here will have been about 9 hours osunflower i think be doing the and big earrings i have one wig and might wear it to work or for special events but rather be comfortable than look a certain way great advice too on recording diet symptoms meds bms to see how doing and request rx if needed start today friendgwen chemo class is great it i felt like it answered so many questions and gave me quite a sense of relief about what was ahead for me bren check check and check for me young kids work school just waiting to see how i manage to keep going on everything thank god the semester ends in 2 weeks and have a 4 week break before my spring semester starts which is also my final semester so i want to keep plugging along is food tasting better for you yet i hope you are able to eat and stay happy to hear your 1st day went well take it easy and get some rest and say our prayers that your se stay minimal hi everyone i have metastatic breast cancer and last year was treated with taxotere and herceptin i still receive the herceptin on a 3 week basis and faslodex monthly i too have side effects from the herceptin that make me feel like crap and it has been getting worse since we went from 90 min to 30 min infusions i usually feel like i have the flu with terrible muscle aches and bad bone pain about 24 hours after i get an infusion i am planning to ask the pharmacist to add a saline drip and increase the dosage time to see if that helps but i would also suggest some alternative treatment for side effects as always check with your own physician before taking my advice but i find i have very good results with cranial osteopathy in reducing my muscle and bone pain you should find someone who is an osteopathic doctor who specializes in cranial work or a pt with many years of experience someone with a course is not going to do it for you i try to get worked on soon after i receive the herceptin and i do find that it minimizes both my discomfort and the length of time i feel bad acupuncture helps too i usually get acupuncture in the week after i receive the herceptin and it helps to restore my energy quite a bit this was more true when i was on chemo where it was like i would get plugged in my blood pressure would normalize and my stomach would calm down try to find an acupuncturist who has experience with cancer also acupuncturists can really help with hot flashes and menopause symptoms for those who are being forced into early menopause anyway everyone is different and what may work for me may not work forothers but i strongly urge anyone who feels miserable to search out bothcranial osteopathy you can find one through the american academy of osteopathic physicians and acupuncture good luck to everyone and i would be curious to hear other the muga test is usually done for herceptin and adriamycin because it can cause reversible heart damage it is a scan done with a tracer injected in vein not a difficult scan it is not usually done with taxotere but i mentioned it because i thought my symptoms were from herceptin but it turns out they were all from taxotere i also asked my onc for something for anxiety depression which is common in cancer patients my onc gave me lexapro which has helped i forgot to mention that he also gave me ativan to help with the nausea and kind of a twofer for me it helps with nausea and anxiety ativan can be addicting sojust be aware last december about 1 month after stopping taxotere we went to disney world i rented a scooter something i had never done before i was glad i did because i was still worn out and that is just marathon walking but i did well there and was already feeling lots better by the end of the next month not sure that i would have needed the scooter everyone of us is so different but in months i had tons more stamina and energy good luck oh and ask about the mugard too it really helped my thrush doc said it is like a liquid bandaid that coats the oral mucosa and helps it heal i just stayed on mugard and nystatin and that did it for me 47 48 in april i had regular periods until i started chemo too i take tamoxifen because at risk for blood clots my oncologist is doing the lupron shots every 3 weeks in conjunction with my herceptin treatment however after this last shot i now have a rash all over my body assuming the lupron because never had a reaction to or from herceptin going to ask him to change it to once a month and deal with making an extra trip there the effexor works well for me i hardly have any hot flashes during the day i still wake up from time to time feeling overheated but not waking up bathed in sweat my doc specifically mentioned joint pain with the aromasin i feel like an 80 yr old woman when i try to start moving but ok once i get going bah i just lost my whole text box annoying is okay but maybe i be so wordy this time ulla i will not be sharing your anniversary last tx with you as i went to cancer clinic to get bloodwork done today and they took one look at me and said no chemo for your tomorrow i started to cry because i feel and have felt so awful the taxotere has not been good to me at all they sent me off for bloodwork regardless but feel that i am allergic to the taxotere and should not have another one of those i will have to see the onc first to see if he wants to give me another fec instead so they phone me later and i have appt with onc on tuesday they only have two here and mine is away so it is a new guy but they are concerned because my liver counts are way out of whack my white counts are fine but they wanted to know if i had been doing any herbals or anything which i have not my in depth blood test were just fine about 6 weeks ago they state that chemo does not cause liver issues as a rule of course i have the presence of mind to ask what do you mean out of whack nor did i have the presence of mind to ask if this may indicate mets i have had pain and bloating in my upper abdomen for a couple of days i thought it was my ongoing constipation issues so resolved that i was constipated but the bloated and pain feelings really did not go away so armed with no accurate information i am seeking out answers to liver mets signs and symptoms well of course they are bloating and pain as i described and i find myself in my mind at the beginning and on hold waiting to find out what is wrong and what it will mean i will have more blood taken on tuesday then i will talk to the oncologist to find out what the new plan is that is what the nurse said i may have to phone the clinic tomorrow and see if there is a possibility that it is mets cos i know if i can wait till tuesday but then am also afraid to phone and ask and may wait till tuesday after all i am going to stay with a friend on the weekend cos she is tired of me going through all of this alone as well i was scheduled for rad oncologist on the 15th of feb ulla so we are very close indeed i know what this new thing will mean though so again on hold i hate it all i am glad you are through the red devil though sue like ulla i had the fec i too wonder about the combination however it is what it is and i guess whatever this liver stuff is it is too light and love to everyone cross your fingers for me karyll i was a little tired from benedryl then wired from taxol on day 1 day 2 nothing at all would not even know i was on chemo did get a little rash days 3 and 4 a little bit of bone and muscle pain days nothing of significance i am so glad that it went well for you rpayton glad you get some time off of work time to focus on you i started on tumeric ginger and magnesium about 8 months after starting tamoxifen and having terrible muscle joint pains especially at night they reduced my pain substantially then in jan i had a total hysterectomy which put me into surgical menopause within about a month my muscle joint pain came back which my doc said might happen with menopause i upped my dosage of all 3 and within a week was back to pain free so for me they definitely help seem to help so much with hot flashes but been taking for about 3 weeks now and they are definitely less in frequency and intensity and sleeping much better hi alaskaangel wow i love alaska and would like to visit sometime thanks for your post i agree endroconolgist is a must see they found that my thyroid was damaged from the radiation so now i take sythroid and most likely for the rest of my life it is the chemo and the tamoxifen that causes this weight gain i was put into menopause overnight so the weight that most women put on over the course of menopause setting in i gained within 6 months i hatecancer bchas roped me of so much and i despise it and wish it would disappear take when my breast cancer met to my liver i did four rounds of the red devil and 4 rounds of taxotere the red devil was east compared to taxotere i broke out with a rash on my hands chest and a yeast infection it was pretty bad they had to put more benedryl in my chemo it got a little better my hands always itched just not as bad when i was finished after the 8th round i was very very tired feeling i wait to feel normal again i was in remission for 1 year and it came back in the same spot in my liver so i did ablation that work it was back in 6 month february 5th i just finished 5 rounds of abraxene did real good with that one but the abraxene get rid of the tumor all the way so i have to start chemo again been doing radiation because we found a little spot on my breast after i finished chemo almost finished with 33 rounds of radiation best part is i had a skin sparing mastectomy with reconstructive surgery i just take 1 day at a time 1 hurdle at a time and i get thru it hang in there did you doctor till you how many rounds he will give you though i know how incredibly grateful i should be that my bc was caught early and treated successfully and i am but this just sucks i am so tired of all the side effects of tamoxifen surgery and radiation fatigue bone pain memory loss depression pelvic pain then when you say or complain your are subjected to additional meds pelvic and trans vaginal ultrasounds advice to follow up with a head shrink additional procedures to check things out i want to go back to before bc before everything scared the hell out of me before when i didn t worry about each and every pain before when my biggest concern was being the girl in the waiting room of the mammography center who was there for hours when everyone else has come and go but for me we need a few more views etc sorry everyone just feeling sorry for myself i needed to let go where others may understand thanks nancy log in to post a reply hi ladies i would like to share my experience with femara sept 11 i started femara almost immediately my joint pain began there were also other side effects i added all sort of supplements to my regimen along with exercise my body felt like it was aging by the hour i remained optomistic about taking it becaue i wanted to do all i could to stop the beast from returning during that time i was reading bco daily especially this thread anyway i saw my mo in may after discussing with him the possible use of an estrogen cream he decided to switch me to tamoxifan which i began june 1st i feel like my old self again i just wanted to share this when i asked why he put me on this in the 1st place he said because femara is better than tamoxifan really that equal out to be about the same considering all the side effects the need for zometa to prevent bone loss which i got very sick from i wish i would have known more when i was diagnosed being on bco has been so informative to me i just wanted to share my story i wish all you wonderful ladies well hi elaine sorry you have to be here but welcome i have been troubled by a fast heart rate since beginning ac i am now approaching my 4 of 12 taxol my heart has been as high as 115 prior to chemo my resting rate was in the 70s lately it has been in the range while this has me concerned the onc is not as worried she always checks again and finds it has slowed down glad your ekg was fine i do find it is worse when i am anxious or more fatigued and from the steroids are you taking them more than one day i hope you and your drs find the best way to ease your symptoms and your mind laura i did well on taxol minor bone pain my hair did begin to grow back while on taxol anything would have been a breeze after ac good luck to you jlstacey and dstar i am still on taxol i am supposed to have 3 more treatments to go my treatment day is wednesdays however last week my oncologist and i discussed the neurapothy issue and decided that if it becomes worse i will hold off next treatment thursday i was ok then on friday when i woke up i noticed my right hand was plagued with numbness i called my dr but decided to wait until monday to make any rash decisions well today sunday the neurapothy had spread to my left hand as well granted not as bad in my hands as in my feet but i think i am still going to hold off on treatment i want this neurapothy to become perminant my dr said as it is it could take up to 5 years or so before it completely goes away and there is no guarantee that it will completely go away i completely understand about being tired but sleep and the mood swings but the fatigue is still one of the biggest battles well that and the constipation and bloating there are just too many side effects to remember them all when someone asks i mean i have been on chemo in general since january at this point i just take the necessary medicine to try to control the current issue at hand and worry about the rest until they become the issue at hand i know it sounds horrible but i be thinking about nausea when my feet hurt so bad i walk i just take something for the nausea and move on to the next side effect why are we putting ourselves through all of this a rhetorical question i look at any of my kids and i know the answer my oldest just graduated thursday from college with her bachelor degree in criminal justice and criminology and a minor in communications i am so proud of her she is 22 years old i only hope she lands a job with the police department special unit that her internship was with beachbum brandi 999 sweethope how are you feeling everyone else keep in touch here i know tough when everyone is trying to recover some from chemo some from surgery i pray for all my bc sisters have a good night everyone glad to hear all the good news i believe the doctors offices have been so insensitive as to call and leave cryptic messages that scared both of you so bad it would have me too i would complain to someone they need to be sensitive to their patients about the water retention i noticed it in the rest of my body as much as in my face to the point my face has been peeling and raw i have tried all kinds of things to help but i guess i just have to wait for swelling to stay down and my face to heal i went to my doctor and she noticed my coughing right away she put me on an antibiotic and told me if that help to call her back not because of a cancer scare but because taxol can cause lung problems that you have to take steriods for so susan you might want to ask your doctor about this if you are still hacking too she put me on a nasal inhaler for that problem and told me to go on zyrtec as well i will do that once i am off this antibiotic i m kind of afraid of it it is levaquin and read horror stories about it lol fun fun i will be set up to start radiation in two weeks sigh it is weary heading into a new battle with new side effects i have my i hate cancer meltdown moments too like right now grrrrr hello everyone i hope you guys are doing well today i had my third weekly taxol its day 15 and the only thing i have so far is my hair is really starting to fall out i think ill have my hubby shave it off in the next couple of days im ready to go for the wigs and hats ive bought im making my cancer as fun as i can i will not let it have control of me i am a step ahead of you buddy thank you cancer for making me a stronger person than i have ever been my hair salon opens tuesday and i will have the cutest hair long one day short the next and maybe ill be a blonde one day too love you guys be strong and stay a step ahead of this and it will all work out huggs maxi hi ann i am 51 and started on arimidex 8 weeks after my surgery through choice due to plans made before i was diagnosed i have been on it for 6 weeks so far and apart from tiredness and a cotton wool brain i do not seem to be suffering too badly touch wood from what i can make out many of the side effects for arimidex are ones that some of us me included get during the menopause and these tablets have the same effect as the menopause by reducing oestrogen i was worried that the tablets would make the symptoms come back but to date it seems ok if you have been through a natural as opposed to surgical menopause i have read somehwere on this site that the symptoms of arimidex are not likely to be so much of a problem not sure if this has helped but good luck anyway in your choice i think i found the choice of treatment the hardest part overall due to my lack of expertise in this area apologies for the ramble rx holy nosebleeds i think taxol makes my nose bleed then it dries up in my nose and then breathe till you well dig the crusty chunks ew i know out then it bleeds again losing my eyelashes and my eyebrows are thinning out i have 7 lower lashes left and on both eyes luckily i still have some on my top lashes i think this weekly taxol is almost 100 better than dd ac other than the above symptoms and chronic constipation and my tummy always looks bloated steroids and eating like a crazy mad woman for 2 days after infusion still is better than ac has anyone in this section had a swelling inflammation gradually develop on the site of recurrent residual triple negative cells near around collar bone and near pectoral muscle my cancer recurred on my masectomy site and i had chemo radiation after 12 years in march 2008 first it wasinfraclavicular i took docetaxol then when it became firm again and tumor marker took capecitabine xeloda starting august 2009 then when a swelling developed larger to supraclavicular taking cisplatin gemcitabine gemzar seeing again the thoracic surgeon and my oncologist this thurs fridayi decided to post this here instead of the tnbc section but i might duplicate it not that common janice dventi i hated that metallic taste one thing someone suggested to me that would give me temporary relief was frozen pineapples the good news is i seem to remember the metallic taste not being as bad near the last couple of tch treatments ashla not sure if you are talking about me but i am pregnant and did have to stop herceptin i have high fluid which is ironic since they stopped herceptin because one of its known side effects on pregnancy is low fluid the baby seems to be doing well however the plan is to induce me at 37 weeks and then to restart my herceptin right away i know how the cancer is doing until a few weeks later when i can have a pet scan but i am feeling good so i am hopeful if that was me you were thinking of thanks so much i have taken tamoxifen for 6months so speak from long term experience i have had few se but have noticed some mild stiffness in my hands upon awakening the dr also says this is more characterstic of arithtic pain i am guessing that having your ovaries out and thus snapping off the estrogen switch probably contributes a great deal to hot flashes and joint pain if you determine low estrogen levels are the culprit have to be really careful about addressing that good you are able to find some relief brenda i am hoping it is the tamoxifen everything you are going through sounds like me 2 weeks off the tamoxifen i felt great now i am exhausted headache and a dull backache hang in there melinda too funny about your daughter giving you the amy winehouse hairdo bren good to know about using minoxidil i will just keep using it for a while then and see what happens i had thick medium coarseness hair before chemo but after about 3 years on tamoxifen my hair started really thinning and just last year was falling out in bunches i hope that by boosting vitamin d and the minoxidil i will start seeing some regrowth thank you for the input and i hope you keep the hair that grown back happy monday morning party for mil went great and she was really surprised only 2 of her brothers able to make it there is 13 counting mil i know what i would do without has really been there for me i overdid it a little but it was worth it both of our were able to be there and 5 of our grandkids it was fun watching them play with all their cousins that they get to see very often worried about randie here too praying she is doing okay i consider all of you my sisters you have became very important to me taxotere 2 this wed fingernails painful today bone pain has eased hoping 2 cause any more pains i keep telling 3 more to go and it will be over love you gals hi i posted in weeks but i try to read when i can you girls are hard to keep up with just a bit over 6 weeks pfc and feeling really good fatigue is lessening and the hair is growing i started tamoxifen a couple weeks ago and so far so good i had lots of hot flashes through chemo chemopause and was afraid be worse with tamoxifen surprisingly my hot flashes have almost gone away entirely wondering if that means my period will be returning soon wherria just a few weeks behind me and we both had tc i too had the muscle aches and from what read from the taxotere it was worst for me from weeks but now feeling much better not totally gone but getting better everyday hang in there this too shall pass sonson my hair grew pretty fast although i was still on herceptin so a bit slower at the time i went topless at 13 weeks still wearing my hair uber short no pony tail for me here is my hair transition linkymermaid _1010 i think there are several reasons why cold caps are not recommended they are and a realy pita to deal with can you imagine if everyone came in with dry ice in coolers with cold caps and how that would get in the way it seems the chemo nurses are so busy and cold caps would just add more confusion if everyone was doing it i would hope in the future cold caps and cold gloves socks would be available to those that do the chemos taxotere that could cause permanent damage i had the bad nail lifting issue and my nails ever fully recovered rainmaze i did 6 rounds of taxotere with carboplatin and my hair came back fine i read about this right after my first tx i assumed it would happen to me because i was already getting some receding before diagnosis but it all came back including a lot of the places it receded assume it will happen to you doing only 4 rounds makes it less likely from what i was told from my friend who has done a lot of research slksmom i was on a different chemo but mine did thin during tx then fell out 5 weeks pfc came in great then thinned but i think that was from anastrozole i have been painting minoxidil on them 1x a day and they are a little bit better and are not shedding anymore btw you ladies with hair pictures are looking awesome springtime i just read from the iodine list how someone had really bad leg cramps after drinking buckets of tea supposedly the tannin in the tea can bind up minerals and make them unavailable for absorption i know how reliable this information is but felt it might be worth sharing anyway better share this other piece of info before it evaporates into the black holes of my brain it would be wise to avoid aloe vera juice prior to surgery also i know people who swear by it but i having very good results and did some homework opinions are widely scattered but the mayo clinic site said it has proven problematic during surgery where it has purportedly led to excessive bleeding most sources say it relieves constipation but my experience was the direct opposite since a beverage and no one ever specifically asks do you drink aloe vera juice i think worth mentioning to anyone approaching surgery i think i even took supplements back when i was facing surgery back then i want to be a pill taker and that included supplements i started tamoxifen yet either but i did take stool softeners to stave off constipation problems i recall that there was any reason not to but now not so sure oh well it work anyway but i think it was ok with the nurses at nola that i was taking the dulcolax oh tina sorry that really stinks how long have you been taking arimidex i have been on it since april and no problems so far i had much more side effects on tamoxifen it gave me what i called crunchy knees from decreased estrogen and they were painful also had really bad shoulder pain while on the tamox plus the weight i gained back i had lost it made me stay hungry all the time lol so far the arimidex do me that way i am staying very hopeful hello all i just found this thread and also am on the tch regime mine started in october 09 and i have 4 tx down 2 to go my doc said most people have bad se to the tch versus the act but i had a severe reaction from this thread sounds like others are also having a bad time with it mine was so bad they decreased the taxotere by 25 tx 2 and 3 were not so bad but 4 has been hitting me pretty bad lots of nausea for days andseveral minutesof intense on the can agony that left me pouring out sweat not sure where the stuff was going to exit from and praying for death thinking of skipping the last 2 tx from this chemo had mega diarreah intense nausea blood clots a bad cold where i ended up in the hospital with a fever of 102 and anemic with low potassium i think my body has had enough mamamiaow i had major pain at night due in part to the femara but mainly due to arthritis to help with insomnia and pain without having to go to heavy drugs i started using melatonin for sleep and a natural anti inflammatory called boswellia serata to ease my pain it has worked so well i am amazed perhaps you might like to check them out for yourself love n hugs chrissy thank you for all the helpful postings i have never been given expert advice maybe i should seek it re diet as when i had some allergy tests done wheat came out as one of them had docs appt blood results show something not quite right with liver but it could be because i am on tamoxifen she has booked me in for a ovarian ultra sound scan as she thinks the tenderness isnt ibs if this is normal and symptoms continue she is going to arrange for a colonoscopy earlier than it should be done flippin nuisance as i dont want to be going to hosps determined to enjoy life however i know so many are worse off than me take care rx i have also had the ac to taxol chemo my 8th taxol is tomorrow from the flu to a cold is a good way to describe my experience too i also have fingernail issues they look absolutely disgusting are lifting off the nailbed and hurt i asked the onc nurse about it last week and she said i will probably lose them how long will it take before new ones are in place ialso lost most of my eyelashes and eyebrows good luck to all of us i did very well with tamoxifen after my first diagnosis but arimidex was as my teenagers say an epic fail my onc wait very long until he pulled me off and started me on chemo okay the straight dope chemo is hard but it works also most bc chemo patients gain weight not lose it been on taxol and avastin for about six months and how my weeks go friday afternoon three and a half hours in the infusion center blissfully sleeping due to the benadryl i take with taxol get home take a nap friday night i could be called one of those whoo girls i forget what movie show from since i usually go out with my bf and am very energetic thank you steroids that they give you with chemo but more about them later saturday good day but being who i am i exert myself too much sterioid ses kicks in and i have a red face which feels hot and i feel super fat i hear claritin can help with this but i tried it yet sunday starting down the slippery slope i like to stay in bed all day but it makes it worse steroid se starting to fade monday i still teach full time so i drag myself into school and try my hardest to get through the day whenever anyone asks how are you my answer is exhausted tuesday usually the worst day of the week unless i take mg of decadron then i can take on the world why i automatically do this because vain and silly see saturday and above wednesday coming around the corner usually wed saturday are okay days they probably could be better if i took better care of myself but oh well the only side effect i can attribute to avastin is the nose business my nose runs constantly i carry a tissue with me wherever i go nosebleeds are common when you blow your nose not pretty the mucus irritates the nostrils but a little vasaline rubbed lightly inside your nose makes it feel better some ladies swear by a netti pot disclaimer this is my experience with this particular chemo everyone is different and everyone tolerates differently fear chemo though now i really answered your big question regarding prognosis have i all say is that i too was very disappointed that hormonals and the oopherectomy that i underwent help me i am glad i found out early and switched to chemo right away i plan on staying around for a long long time mostly to prove my onc wrong who gave me a decade the next treatment on our horizon is the vaccine look at the thread hang in there ladies for some encouragement back i know been at least a month but have been loosing my mind decided to refinance the house property and did 3 weeks of catch up clean painting minor repairs etc for the appraisal and spent so much time over a 4 day long weekend on my feet my legs swelled doc freaked and had to get a ultrasound to rule out blood clots i told them i was just trying to be wonder woman and in fact it was what i thought nothing was doing all that along with working full time in the middle of a major annual project i seem to be the type to bite off more than i should in the meantime plugging along with my tch every 3 weeks and my herceptin weekly finished 4 the last of july and my blood counts hit the skids for the second time but onc is amazed how well i bounce back on my own within a week still no shots yipee maintaining my weight biggest difference since may has been a 2 lb loss one week which of course i was thrilled was due for my 5 tch today but when i got to the office onc like the echo cardio i had last friday and got me an appointment with a cardiologist within 30 minutes who did another echo and ekg all is fine kinda bummed because you know how you mentally prepare for the long chemos and then so close to the finish line have it postponed well it catch up for me yes i am still alive and doing pretty darn good through this process sorry i vanished for awhile but there are only so many hours in a day hope everyone is doing as well as can be expected spirits are high close to the finish line or finished for many and few if any thanks a lot thegoodfight and dlb 823 sfbaer actually refers to sf bay what a coincidence the first time i use that as a user name my mom had the allergic reaction about 5 min after adminstration of taxotere too her face turned red in a sudden and she felt tight in chest area the nurse stopped and two other nurses who looked like the lead nurses came in and prepare the benadryl and one other thing then the onc came and they applied the two shots thru iv she rested 30 min or so and restart with slower drip rate it worked out fine and she felt asleep like baby she had decadron before taxotere and prescribed zofran and compazine she vomit at all today she has very mild diarrhea and she took the imodium that i got on day 1 doing great although she stilll has no appetite i hope her appetite will come back in a few days she said hard to swallow food because it felt so sandy i know what word to use because she describe the feeling in chinese and i come across with a vocabulary for that when the food is moving from the mouth to throat to esophagus planning to get her some nice hat and scarf this weekend since it looks like her hair will start coming off on sunday monday based on majority of posts in here keep posted and wish everyone having tough time can hang in there bad time will pass terry i was thinking of tink also so hope we heard from her cause she is doing well and having a great summer and the group dance was meant to be a great hug also sammie kay i am looking for a very special dance for you right now it will be here before you know it

shaved it off twice now gone and i have 5 shadow either tamoxifen side effects been on tamoxifen for just over 2 months and having the joint pain mostly knees and the hot flashes night sweats taken the pill 20mg at night and in the morning and it makes no difference to me but these are all very manageable however last friday my left upper inner thigh started hurting like a bruise but there is no bruise there i checked all weekend today going to my doctor to check it out and make sure not a blood clot of all the side effects of tamoxifen dvt and blood clots are my worse fear wish me luck girls marieps cs i loved your failing eyesight observation so true christina i am also trip neg i finished taxotere and cytoxin at the end of june this year taxotere bad i hear that andrimycin is much worse i had metal mouth leg pain but found that walking helped even if i want to do it i did it anyway and had bad symptoms for 3days approx 3 days after treatment my legs were very tired and remain tired to this day however i did not have any neuropathy and many others i know did not have neuropathy either so good luck to you i think do fine hi ladies i had my first chemo last week hoping i did the capping correctly i did get some freezer burn frostbite on my hairline i have a peak so it was tough to get the moleskin just right without ripping hair out i also used black nail polish and iced my fingers and toes hoping that will get me through taxotere feeling good just have this horrible and random acne does anyone that had this after treatment have any pointers the onc nurse i talked to today thought it was a reaction to the perjeta been using cetaphil and taking benadryl but still here 9 days later thanks for all the tips and tricks from everyone hi kristen i have been on herceptin since november 2013 and over the last 6 weeks i have developed joint pain and swelling in my hands and joint aches in my feet my whole body feels achy like i need a really good massage or something my mo thought that this could be residual effects from the taxotere keep us posted on the new med your doing wish you the best of luck hi shari sorry to see you are going through this i had the same issue dx in2008 with dcis had lumpectomy and sentinel node removed clear margins no node involvement so no chemotherapy had mammosite radiation and then went onto the ais for 5 years but two years later last june i found a lump in my neck which when biopsied turned out to be triple negative bc so went from a stage 0 to stage iv started taxol with avastin and had good results through this past january taxol was stopped due to growing neuropathy just got avastin but due to activity in neck area again had 24 rads to neck area ct scan on this past tuesday showed new lesions in nodes in left arm and pectoralis minor muscle and only marginal reduction of some nodes in neck while smaller nodes disappeared so it looks like a mixed bag of results talk to onc on wednesday to see what next treatment regimen will be that being the case not sure i can help you but like for us to stay in touch and perhaps compare notes taxol actually has a higher incidence of permanent nueropathy than taxotore i am so glad i get taxol i only have some minor numbness in my left heel all chemos have se some are lasting some are not some are serious heart issue with adrymicin but the chances are rare or less common with many of these se just be sure you know all the se so you can make an informed decision stormynyte so glad filling in be warned though this might be as long as it will grow if you do have taxotere induced alopecia i still think early and you may not have this hi all sorry everyone is in pain i had same joint and muscle pain had hard time getting up and down stairs went today for third taxol told my oncologist about symptoms of joint pain and some tingling and numbness in my hands and feet so that was it made me agree to delay treatment til next week and hear about anything else just want to get this done as i drive two hours one way for treatment and still had surgery i hate this whole cancer journey hi downunder always dreamed of going to australia so sorry about your pain and sure its the femara too i just thought share my experience with the vitamin d the whole reason taking tamoxifen instead of an ai is because of joint pain etc my onc thrilled with my decision but i know i would be less active on one so tamoxifen for me even though past menopause shore i was over 95 estrogen positive with a hysterectomy that would get rid of estrogen produced by the ovaries and uterus but estrogen is also manufactured in small amounts by the liver breasts and adrenal glands this means even with a hysterectomy the left over estrogen must be blocked from any potential cancer cells right now for women in menopause natural surgical or chemical most oncs use an ai aromatase inhibitor to block that estrogen instead of tamoxifen i would like to stay on tamoxifen to deal with left over estrogen rather than go to an ai tamoxifen has more long term studies more data about efficacy over time and more read conflicting studies about them being as effective more effective and less effective than tamoxifen i even know if my onc would agree he typically puts women on ais after menopause though he admits he prefers tamox for the same reasons lots of data does that make sense thanks everyone for the replies i really appreciate your encouraging words and that youtake the time to respond i have less than 3 weeks until my last taxol and then i will be having a pet and a breast mri i may even have a biopsy again to see what is going on with this breast because it is still very hard and has color change i was nursing at the time of diagnosis so we are hoping a lot of the breast has scar tissue fat necrosis or something besides just cancer otherwise i have had an extremely poor clinical response i think that is what concerns me the most about this weird back pain if i am not responding great clinically to chemo than there been much to keep this cancer from ravaging my body for the last 3 months my axillary lymph nodes are much smaller that is the only good sign i think i may go ahead with the thoracicmri when i see my oncologist next week i am already assuming its mets so might as well know for sure i am getting neulasta but that pain is very distinct and resolves in a few days i know this from when i did the a c i do have joint bone pain all over that persists longer from the taxol but the back pain just feels verydistinct and very different iwaslow normal body weight atdiagnosis and now am a little underwieght lost pounds in the first week of my diganosis on the omg i have breast cancer diet and can not put it back on i am eating healthy and exercising the fact that i can not seemto put on weight and keep losinga little also concerns me i think i will try yoga i have never been afan but maybe it will help me now thanks again for your response you are sweet carolsue sounds like your little one is enjoying her grown up time the hardest thing is letting go let her be the mommy and feel important all too soon she want to have anything to do with you i hope not mine is 16 and she still wants to hang with the old folks i had my final full infusion today well of the full infusion while my blood counts were low they drop from last time kidneys were good liver function was funky my onc drs actual word he said they were funky last time and improved so he pulled the taxotere i looked at him and said do i have to come back and get it am i still done he said yes i was still done and i have to come back he thinks pulling the taxotere will also help with the leg swelling but he sent me for an ultrasound just to be sure there anything lurking the tech said it looked good going for a echo in 2 weeks to be sure heart function is still good as been really fatigued and short of breath at times he thinks that may have more to do with my funky liver so only herceptin and carboplatin today yay a short 2 hours instead of 4 tomorrow i start on the biphosphonate study 2 large pills first thing in the morning eat and remain upright for 30 minutes that will be fun while trying to navigate the nausea i feel in the mornings the first several days i start herceptin infusions july 7 and will also start tamoxifen need a very large pill caddy geez feeling good as the steroids are doing their magic come saturday night i ll be feeling the effects glad to be through that part of this journey heather good luck with your move and job hunting i lived in florida 9 years before moving back north i have never regretted our decision annie i just had taxol today i have done well on taxol 9 the fatigue got to me i just needed to rest more two days after my tx i would feel exhausted probably coming off the steroid i also vented about some se on the taxol thread a few timeswishing you good days lisajcj great idea bgirl happy happy are you 29 again loli am sooooooo behind with the post i think it will take me 3 hours to catch up my 2nd taxol is monday not sure it is going to happen because i have been sick for 7 days with cold and infection going on yikes it is snowing outside oh soo pretty my excuse not to go out lol new lol love you gals without you i would be depressed every day anji a tip for right before the neulasta which can have very painful bond take one claritan and one aleve prior to neulasta do it on day two and three after neulasta and hardly any pain i have a c t and adriamycin is popular for the metal taste as well know if it will help you with your regime but if you keep icechips in your mouth at start of infusion and i continue for theentire time of the adriamycin infusion hr to suck on them no metallic taste at all good luck linda i called it evil taxotere i had bone pain eye infections lost all eyelashes my mouth was thrashed my skin peeled off of my feet nails on toes and hands were toast terrible tummy problems but it did shrink my tumors much more than ac did i feel for you thanks for all the well wishes i did go through a period of side effects with anastrozole generic headaches blurred vision dry skin bone ache especially hips and feet and hair loss lots of hair loss thank goodness that my hair came in like crazy after chemo ended jan 2010 and the hair loss is not that noticeable to others just me and my hairdresser i had the side effects from about 2 weeks on with anastrozole started in sept 2013 and after a few months my body adjusted and been feeling ok since christmas knock wood here just hoping that the switch to arimidex brand name will not bring on more side effects or a repeat of the ones been through already took my first pill today so see secretgardn hi my wbc was really good at the beginning of taxol then slowly began to drop so i have to delay any more tx already had one week added to my 12 weeks because my anc dropped to 9 and i was untx that week getting neupogen shots between weekly taxols now so i can complete tx i use claritin daily anyway to counteract the watery eyes runny nose stopped up ears thing but i can tell you had no problems with neupogen se maybe because of the claritin maybe because a lot of us just i think glasses hide a lot of lash and brow know that makeup artists suggest that if you wear glasses supposed to wear a bit more eyemakeup just to keep your eyes from disappearing behind glasses anyway i think anyone can tell what my lash loss is unless they get right up in my face remember most everyone else in the world is like about how they look to others and not scrutinizing other looks i doubt notice what we see a lack of anyway icing hands and feet and brows and lashes when i remember so far my nails are good and no complete loss of eyebrow or lash hair claire going to have to agree that taxotere has been a nightmare i was fine for three days but my entire sense of taste has changed on day four i know if i got the jitters from the steroids or what but i sleep i got two hours sleep a night for three nights and then experienced extreme pain i developed a fever for sixteen hours had to go on heavy antibiotics and injections vomited a lot on day six got another skin infection this is the third one due to broken hair follicles on my head putting together a better plan for the next cycle this was not fun at all while i like the nausea on ac at least it was familiar so very happy my onc chose the tch we discussed both protocols at least this way i went through about 6 months of herceptin before they had to take me off of it and the heart problems finally went away about 2 years later yippee smile i would definitely go with tch unless a specific reason to go with the act wishing all the people here working on this decision much luck wondering if tamoxifen causes fatigue tiredness and also feeling like you are getting your period even when not i have been taking it and those are 2 things i have been causing me some worry hi all i have been on tamoxifen for 9 months i have had no issues i also started effexor at the same time and i have had no night sweats i am premenopausal and was really starting to have some peri menopausal issues prior to the tamo effexor combo i did have very erratic bleeding and a few periods i have had none since july i have to go to my ob gyn every 3 months for an endometrial biopsy to make sure i have uterine cancer from the tamoxifen which is a pain so thinking about a hysterectomy what is one more surgery my doctor plans to keep me on the tamoxifen for 10 years yikes glad i can tolerate it oh yea my skin in dry and my hair is thinner and dryer but minor complaints if it is keeping the cancer away pm me with any questions hollycat jill in birmingham al tracie and survivor woman thanks so much for your kind notes today is a better day i increased my walking time from 20 to 25 min and being kind to myself today i think i started on this path of treatment because i love my husband so much i realized from the moment of my diagnosis that he was terrified of losing me and i was terrified at the thought of leaving him alone sunflower i only did two full doses of taxotere with reduced dose of the third and discontinued completely on the fourth round substituted adriamycin for that round due to the neuropathy the neuropathy has persisted and i am nearly 14 weeks out from the last taxotere i have been told that it could take up to two years or longer for the neuropathy resolve and that if it resolve i would get used to it not a terribly happy prospect see my previous post for all the whiny details i am currently on gabapentin with some improvement but having significant side effects from the drugs by the way did take not lysine as i said in my previous post and not sure whether it helped but i think i may give it another try lots of positive vibes and prayers today to all you ladies all hang in there and get strong thank you for your responses smithlme and pearl i had the leg pain during taxol also still have some numbness and tingling in my fingertips lost my fingernails and toenails still just growing back now this clenching in my legs 4 months after my last taxol treatment maybe this too will pass not sure what my hemo is i know after my next taxol i am getting pet scan before surgery though i am so scared of these results i dont know how much more i can handle pain after taxol is awful i honestly hope this gets better i have so many surgeries comming up radiation plus the doctor for reconstruction said i need to lose weight now or he cant reconstruct after my last taxol which is nov 11 i am doing weight lose pills plus it will keep estrogen down if i lose right now doing lupron shot i just feel like crapola hello ladiessuffering from insomnia its been a while since i have been on here just went to a local support group meeting and found out i was the youngest one there i felt like such a baby p well i am going to get my head shaved today since my 2nd treatment will be on wed my scalp is itching like crazy so nervous i told my daughter that she has to hold my hand because i might cry p on 4xac then 4xt hope my se go better this time especially the heartburn hi guys i started with the taxol neuropathy or i think it is that about 8 months ago i now am having so much pain in my feet that i can hardly stand i m ok after walking for a while however when i first stand up oh my goodness i am exactly one year past chemo so i am not sure what is going on the pain just started a few weeks ago i have a massage therapist who works on my feet and it does no good at all my toes and where my toes attach to the foot are numb if you put your hand on the ball of my foot and push the pain is so severe that i can hardly stand it i am going to make an appointment with podiatrist real soon any ideas hi ladies i am visiting from the started chemo in september thread but since you ladies are farther along i have a question i am having my last a c on wednesday and will then begin 12 weeks of taxol one each week my question is how are you taxol ladies doing the accumalitive effects of the a c have left me pretty fatigued and am starting to be concerned about the every week chemo thanks and good luck to all of you luppie welcome i started anastrozole a little over a month ago side effects achy joints flulike aches and sudden depression started about 2 weeks ago for me se everyday so that helps make it tolerable have you started on a hormone inhibitor hi all i just completed my 5th taxol treatment today things are going very well i have minimal side effects mainly just fatigue i met with a radiation oncologist today and i will find out next week whether or not i will have to get radiation after the chemo i hope not as it might have a negative impact on my breast reconstruction but of course i will do whatever they recommendin hopes ofpreventing a recurrence i have not been working and my family has been a great support i am anxiously awaiting my unblinding on nov 4th hope everyone is doing well and keeping the faith kara i finished 6 rounds of tch every 3 weeks in late may 09 continued on with 3 weekly herceptin only which i finished 5 weeks ago late january 10 i was so interested to hear from gina_m about her experience of those itchy andstinging episodes onthe skin when warm i too had this on my back whenever i was out for a walk in the sun it really was painful i tried to describe this to my husband but he just looked baffled they seem to have stopped now generally after thetch which i found very difficult and had lots of problems with treatment with herceptin only was relatively easy i did have a drippy nose and running eyes the running eyes were attributed to taxotere hip aches and problems with my nails ridged and lifting at the corners the worst issue for me is my hair after all this time it is only about inches on top and very thin you can see my scalp shining through i have a few eyebrow hairs which i can feel but not see they are colourless my eyebrows fell out about a month after my last tch treatment my eyelashes are still really short did anyone find thattheir hair sorted itself out after finishing herceptin rose is correct tamoxifen does not put you into menopause in fact my onc was very very clear about it while i am taking tamoxifen i either use two kinds of bc condoms spermicide get sterilized or husband has the big v you will continue to ovulate and if you become pregnant the tamoxifen can seriously damage the fetus that said you can stop taking tamoxifen at any time and if you took it for 2 years went off it long enough for it to clear your system got preg had baby well it happens there are side effects and there are risks if i had issues with blood clots i take it really a matter of looking at your own risks and what tamoxifen can do for you the younger you are the less likely you are to get some of the most serious ses cancers clots strokes associated with the drug things change your onc wants you to consider taking it in 4 years a lot can happen in 4 years you may have a different onc who prescribe tamoxifen the first onc i saw you may have more things show up or not you may or may not even have the same partner taking charge of fertility while in your early 30 s is probably a good idea though and be asking the onc if s he was offering to set up the college fund or else keep quiet you certainly have a lot to think about and a lot of it is uncomfortable since i am the master procrastinator i would put the tamoxifen decision out of my mind for another couple of years live as fully as i can now keep up the monitoring and think long and hardabout children and timing i hope it getseasier oh my this thread is welcome and good luck to you 2ndtime4me if we can help you just let us know freygea and babyruth and txmom my thoughts are with you as you navigate the taxotere ses i remember that my friend sent me a bag of chocolates during my 2nd round of taxotere they tasted like sawdust and a chocoholic so that was devastating but somewhere around round 5 i tried them again and suddenly they tasted great such a strange thing not sure if i mentioned it before but lemon flavored anything was my favorite towards the end of my 6 rounds i was chewing gum pretty much all day to keep the weird taste out of my mouth like ann said it gets better once you drop the taxotere and food tastes like food again i guess lucky to have missed most of the problems with neuropathy i sometimes wonder if it is because always had poor circulation in my hands and feet i do have weird things that started on the taxotere and still happen occasionally like my left nostril goes numb for a few minutes here and there and my right foot rings it vibrates just like a cell phone i told the nurse that the other day and i think she put it in my chart i hope she worded it differently thanks for the compliments on my avatar i thought i should look like i do now rather than my photo i like yours too karen just stopping to say hi and to let you know that tamoxifen se seems to have dissapeared at least the fatigue i am so happy for that almost normal now just a little dizzy when i stand up fast or move my head fast hopefully that will pass as well madee 53 i was dx in january and started taxol herceptin the end of march just had my 7th treatment 5 more to go before herceptin alone been too bad get premeds to help with se i have lost a lot of hair my hair was already short and that made it easier i would recommend getting a short haircut i did not shave my head but i did buy a wig i wear out i can still wear a baseball cap i am not a scarf person but did make some tee shirt hats easy and instructions on youtube time will tell if i am going to lose it all doc says maybe not it is different for everyone some tired days plus i am 70 years old so my be harder on me than a younger woman dee hi girls i love all the beauty tips i am a so being bald and watching my eyelashes fall out daily due to being on weekly taxol is killing me not to mention the dry skin anybody have any tips on making lashes grow back faster or how to look as normal as possible in the meantime natural glow moisturizer for face does a great job of adding a little healthy looking color suze hoping that the veterans here can give me some hope today is day 6 of my first tc and i remember feeling so desolate the good is managed by meds no fever or infection noted no allergic reaction to the taxotere no excruciating painsince the night of the neulasta shot but the fatigue the unrelenting achy joint pain the weird things that come and red rash on one arm that fades mouth sores that are starting and taunting me constantly changing there an end i imagine can barely stay out of bed for two hours at a time but i really sleep either a few hours at night with ambien always felt that i can get through anything but i know that i can tolerate 4 cycles like this fatique chest muscles arms shoulders upper back neck and much neuropathy from taxol the rads onc said i probably have frozen shoulder to do these silly finger on the wall exercises rediculous or not to take a hormonal tamoxifen or the ais is a very personal decision one which ultimately you have to make after a lot of careful consideration and with the recommendations of your medical team bound to hear a lot of women who had a difficult time on this board because this is where they come to get support you would not be as likely to hear from women who are doing well i happen to be doing very well but like to share my experience in hopes of helping others if i can been taking tamox over years with relatively mild ses hot flashes insomnia and achiness as a preventative i have lcis and family history and trying to prevent an invasive bc in the future the way i look at it is i probably been having similar ses from menopause anyway another thing that helped me in my decision to take mom had radiation and tamox is now a survivor of over twenty years without a reccurence and have any significant ses from the tamox either i would however recommend a yearly transvaginal ultrasound to monitor the uterine lining and the ovaries good luck with your decision so sorry to read about all the stomach problems i was on aciphex during my tac and stopped it 2 weeks after my last one and i am doing really good the zantac and otc stuff help me i am only taking neruontin for the numbness effexor for hot flashes and b6 and i also use radiaplex 3 times a day about the radiation unless you are taking another chemo drug you will probably feel ok to work i am on herceptin right now on a weekly basis and that paired with radiation tends to cause the hemoglobin to drop so i have low rbcs but not enough to take procrit i only get mildly tired on friday after a week of treatments i go in for today my breast gets warm and kinda stays that way and gets a little red after treatment occasionally i have little twinges of pain but its nothing much i even need tylenol as yet i get tattooed i get on tuesdays and see the rad doc on wednesdays and sometimes they adjust the beams so i have marker i know you will think rads is a piece of cake compared to chemo hugs marcia hi everyone i talked to thenurse over the phone at the docs office today my breast ultrasounds are normal but my liver ultrasound shows an enlarged liver she said no lesions were seen the nurse said to come in and speak with the doctor about this she said the swollen lymph nodes were just fattylumps thank god she said the doctor needs to see me about my liver that is all she said now i am concerned about my liver i have googled this and an enlarged liver can be caused by many things one of them is mets to liver another is tamoxifen i took aromasin so i wonder if this counts another is viral hepatitis i did have a flu bug about a month ago and had to take antibotics for a sinus and ear infection so i have to go see the doctor in person i am a little overweight but not obese i think irarely drink i do take antidepressants but am starting to wean off i guess i just have to wait at least the lumps are not mets wendy just started my tamoxifen day 6 the only two i am dealing with right now is the night sweats i had them before radiation and before tamoxifen but they are definitly different before it was just a warm feeling waist up now i wake up and soaked and i sleep with blankets i lay naked on top of the blankets and swear probably never feel my husband again as i bear to crawl under the covers any more the second one has come on slow i feel like a real b h today and all week and i speak because afraid anything i say is going to come out nasty i just nod and shake my head when people try to converse with me my poor husband i am taking 20 mg of tramadol for the pain but mostly because a side effect is a sense of and it helped throughout my radiation when depressed without me giving in to the celexa they prescribed me which gave me a migraine after two days well since taking tamoxifen the tramadol is doing nothing at all and i just feel like crap i hope the go away as some have stated i will wait this out and see just thought chip in here and add my two cents will keep posted and keep reading for tips thanks everyone nrp i am thankful for this thread i let too many people know my situation had chemo so i still look the same except for my chest a scarf hung around the neck and draped stylishly hide some defects last appointment with oncologist was ok my scans were checked and he said he saw scar tissue where the bone mets are my next appointment is in four months i am taking tamoxifen and having se those hot flashes again refused hrt when i did go thru menopause cause of cancer risk and some really strong mood swings have to take ativan so i can be human around others so far no bone pain i get annoyed when oncologist asks how the pain is so far no or little discomfort i like hearing the stories of people who have lived with this for years gives me hope that i will be one of themcharlotte i finished chemo in nov 2014 and continued with herceptin in august 2015 been in pain all over since chemo ended just last month i had labs drawn with a holistic dr and she said that my labs point to lupus my oncologist agreed after seeing my labs the oncologist thinks i had lupus prior to cancer though and by finishing chemo my body went into a flare with lupus i have all over joint and muscle pain weakness extremely elevated cholesterol never had elevated ana and dsdna levels as well as the butterfly rash i always thought i had rosacea read that having lupus predisposes you to getting breast cancer seeing a rheumatologist in may looking forward to feeling better someday good luck to you hi i agree everyone is different i started chemo at the end of november with 3 x fec and then 3 x tax finishing 19 march overall the process was manageable fec was straight forward after the first treatment i was sick the evening after but then the sickness was controlled by emend anti sickness thereafter taxotere was different again were aches and pains caused by the injections to increase the white cells tiredness from the steriod and nasty taste in them mouth but again manageable and were gone by day 10 hair loss has caused a few tears but managaged to hold onto eyelashes and eyebrows so once wig is in place know one knows 4

this whole thing has scared the hell out of me but i just caught a plane that had a really wonky turbulence filled and it struck me how a whole lot of things that can potentially change our lives justhoping for the wisdom to know which of those i can do something hello 30 mother of 3 small children i was dx in sept of 2012 i have been through 4 ac which were very hard on me mostly because i hydrate i actually have to go to the hospital twice a week to get fluids but that really helped me through the ac so if your like me and drink much go get fluids also take all the meds as directed i never got sick but i did get constipated so adding bran to food and eating prunes helped me out a lot also i use biotene toothpaste and mouth wash i have yet to get a mouth sore or canker sore i swear by this stuff i constantly wanted to eat when i was on ac i tried to make good choices but i mostly craved pasta and potatoes i did get very fitigued by my 4th ac i had been taking my son on walks through the neighborhood once a day but by the last ac i do it anymore losing my hair was huge for me but the very worst was when i lost my eyebrows and eyelashes i just look flat now i have completed 10 taxols and have 2 more to go so excited that i will be done with chemo in the next 2 weeks taxol was much better for me then ac not as tired and can actually get stuff done around the house now i have noticed some urinary and vaginal issues though has anyone else experienced that i also have herceptin till december i know that can cause done vaginal dryness and makes your body think you are in menopause i get hot flashes all the time and cold sweats only 30 i be experiencing this stuff right now i have surgery in april and then radiation i hope i can be of help if anyone has any ac or taxol questions so glad i found this forum nice to know not alone so great to hear from you jackie i know your on pins and needles waiting for path report good vibes are being sent your way be patient with the post op discomfort and drains use your pain meds and each day should be better shaun sorry you had to delay your a c those pesky white cells i always received just one neulasta shot 24 hours after the a c i know it was an option to get multiple injections i always took my claritin but never had the bone pain had lots of other pains but not bone pain keep your strength up with good nutrition and lots of water i was able to get taxol today and it went great no nausea like last time but i had her drip the benadryl and pepcid in rather then push it like last time i think it helped still feel a little brain fuzzy from the decadron not hopeful that i will sleep well tonight but reading a good book so okay with that hoping to be able to take a nice long walk tomorrow springtime in the rockies is always an adventure i am so thankful that all of you are in my cyber life i just might put it on my bucket list to meet as many of you in person as i can jackie my daughters boyfriend lives in ontario so a road trip to canada is a possibility amy i started with tamoxifen and everything was fine until about 8 months or so and then the worst pain was my achilles heel it was so bad i could not get right up out of bed i wept my onco in wi did not care when arimidex went generic i started that again fine for a few months and then the foot pain with arimidex i also had some thumb joint pains that was it plus thinning hair interesting my onco never suggested testing my estrogen levels so god only knows going on in there i feel naked without the meds but i feel better overall was 39 at diagnosis and am stage 2 in 1 node so more advanced than you my doc has me on tamoxifen only i asked her about ovarian suppression actually removal because i freaked out when i started getting my periods back but she said that is too aggressive a move given my young age and that i should not be worried about having my period she said a good sign that my body is healthy and recovering from all of the treatment and that i should trust that the tamoxifen is doing job i have been on tamoxifen for 10 months now with insomnia as the only side effect i had hot flashes initially but they went away as my period returned i really sleep well at all but i sleep well before the cancer diagnosis my doc tells me definitely made worse by the tamoxifen so i have given in to the sleeping pill and am not feeling guilty about taking it anymore i gained any weight have lost about 8 lbs but have been trying to and my hair is coming back fine although very curly good luck rose can cause a rash but not known for causing exzema about the fear of cardiac to your onc get some testing done or change back to tamoxifen important to feel comfortable with your treatment cardiac arrests are very rare but knowing that help if you happen to be the rare person it happens to do you take anything for the anxiety i know i get through without my xanax even if i take it very often anxiety certainly comes with the diagnosis and help when someone already has an anxiety issue the claritin actually works and both my onc and pcp recommended it my pcp says it has properties i was having horrible bone pain recently when i on any ai and i took the claritin for a couple of weeks and it made all the difference and now that i am on faslodex injections i took claritin when i first had the loading shots and the bone and joint pain was back now gone and i take the claritin unless the pain is back made a huge difference in my mobility and energy level hello allgood to read your you all continue to do to hear from you glad you are not in the chemo went amazing how one forgets about it so maybe i am just preoccupied with the next ok bit of a drag going daily then hanging around all day in an empty house as all my lot are in crete doing my bad fires but it was in east athens i am north so we didnt get much just a load of ashes have started those ai s mine is too much to say about them at the moment the nails continue to be disgusting but i have come to terms with that seeing as its a matter of time i dont think it will affect you with your regime it was the taxotere that did it for me hair is minimal if its growing at all i cant see trying not to up the cold cap it will be worth it cant think why i dropped out of that one must have been having an izzy fit take carehugs to allannaxxx hi penny it sounds like we have had many of the same side effects from taxol some go through without an issue i was actually pretty good until 6 i had a bloody nose the whole time i would be stuffed up and then blow blood forawhile and had bloody noses at least a couple of times a day you know the issue with my nails my fingernails are making me crazy 3 are lifting i am three weeks out and will tell you in general i feel so much better but do anything betwen my fingers and feet it is so frustrating maybe you can finish they lowered my dose on so was 25 lowered to help with the side effects i think it did help but by then my nails were history i think many suggested b6 which i started taking i really tell a differnce butothers said it can help with the neropathy good luck i hope you start feeling a little better betting a lot more people will respond to your question as well sometimes the are a little more quiet than week days so keep checking back i think you may be a bit closer to sure from centralia but go to marion il for my treatments will be starting my rads soon they called to set that up yet finished my last taxotere on april 30th still working with the sore finger and toe nail beds achy legs hard to walk on feet but it will all clear up sooner or later this group is large enough that someone will have the answer you are looking for so stayed tuned jackie my liver mets were found incidentally i have no symptoms and my tumor markers were normal i have left side flank pain and nobody knows what that is not caused by the liver but so far seem to be cancer either i will find out for sure on monday all just a crapshoot we walk a fine line between freaking out over every normal ache and pain and knowing your body and what is normal so you can tell the doctor when there is something unusual your symptoms sound like normal symptoms the tingling in the hands and feet is neuropathy it may or may not go away the sweating is definitely from the tamoxifen i just wake up in a puddle of water gross i found some hot flash pajamas that do help now i need hot flash sheets good luck on your tests sure be fine the one thing noticed is when i have active cancer i sleep a lot more my daily 30 minute nap turns into a 3 hour one and just nodding off all the time seems to be a cue for me i have always been kind of tomboyish even at 49 so makeup has always been hard for me love this thread i got so excited i went out to rite aid and found some maybelline quad that tells you what to put on lid crease brown bone and corner i need help i have always been a pink or sand wearer they also had some revelon quads for buy one get one free of course i got the pink and splurged with coastal colors wait to try them out my best friend in college was a makeup artist it took her hours to get her makeup on me 10 minutes then she would fix me up and it would be amazing but i could never get the hang of it are there any eye make up manuals that i could get after all this i want to really look feminine again also nailpolish i always paint my toes so sexy very rarely my nails until taxotere messed them up i used to love cover girl nail slicks because they were so glossy i put on polish on my nails base coat 2 coats of polish and shiny top coat and still after 2 days the ends begin to wear off what polish is everyone using and what colors debbie i had my second treatment of gemzar yesterday the first treatment did a number on my blood counts so they reduced the dose by 50 and i have to go back next wednesday for labs it was supposed to be my week off when we start back up get the reduced dosage but add abraxane to the mix i had two cycles of carboplatin it made me miserable with nausea and it seems my cancer just loved the stuff my tumor markers went from 1000 to almost 2000 and my scans showed progression just about everywhere a little discouraging that since may 2012 not a single chemo has worked and yet i was ned in october 2011 after dd ac t i need a miracle i have been on femara letrozole since feb 2010 and have had no issues with it when i started femara it was only available under the brand name femara when it became available later as the generic form letrozole i went to generic and have been on it since definitely no joint bone pain i am old by calendar years 69 but i have lived a very active outdoor life all my life so do have some aches and pains for years from what done and do to my body i do any and everything i want to some of my favorite activities are riding caring for our horses bicycling mowing yards with my push mower flyfishing are a few being many yrs post menopause or post hysterectomy does not mean that we do not have estrogen in our body the pituitary gland produces estrogen men have estrogen in their body we ingest it in many foods i am er never been overweight was very active and was 19 yrs post natural menopause but my ibc is was er added forgot to say i have never had hot flashes either when i went through natural menopause at 44 or from femara letrozole in almost 6 yrs oh sweet ladies i had a delayed allergic reaction to taxotere like the next day alomst i was burned inside and out with blisters all over my body vomiting black toenails hair fell out imediately was in the er and continue to be at least twice a week for four weeks now for iv fluids huge abscesses on tongue taste buds fried candida infections all over my body on fourth round of diflucan and nystatin powder godawful pain in the bones it has been neverending and i had an onc who could give a crap saying he had never seen a reaction like mine and had no idea what to do i got a second opinion from a doc from chapel hill today and he wanted to admit me to hospital imediately poor guy my bp was at amwhen we had our went nuts then i stood up and bp shot to like 168 or i was rushed to the er for more iv fluids and tests and i refused wanted to go home as i am so sick of doctors but it was nice to finally have a doctor who seemed to react appropriately to the situation i feel so crazy not much consolation he did say there are drugs just as effective as tax for chemo so i am looking at other options blessings sv i have been on femara for the best part of 5 years with no that were any worse than the tamoxifen that i had been on for years which for me were entirely arimidex and femara are very similar drugs any drug which cuts down on the oestrogen in your body will give you the of having less oestrogen such as hot flushes and vaginal dryness basically menopausal symptoms some people get them worse than others just as some people get worse symptoms at their natural menopause than others if your cancer is reducing the oestrogen in your body is an extremely important way to reduce the likelihood of recurrence or slow it down the other thing is you could start either of these drugs and then stop it if you really bear the they are all reversible good luck claireinaz you will find that ais are the same as tamoxifen some peoplegain some lose and some stay the same it may be the effexor that has caused the weight gain and it may also be that menopause itself is what has caused the gain because of decreased metabolic rate and an increased loss of muscle mass that is physiological not because you are not working the muscles themselves loss of estrogen from menopausealso causes your body to burnits fuel differently and less effectively affecting insulinresistence and fat storage someone posted above about decreased estrogen but tamoxifen does not cause that it is a hormone receptorblocker it blocks the receptors on the cells while leaving circulating estrogen alone this is why it is given to women who need estrogen for other body functons and protection aromatase inhibitors do suppress estrogen in the form of inhibiting the enzyme aromatase whichconverts androgens toestrogen the assumption is that you are not producing estrogen any longer if you are truly menopausal i have taken arimidex and femara have used myfitnesspal and with moderate exercise and 1200 low glycemic index calories a day have lost weight but i have to be really diligent about the exercise when i say moderate i am talking abouta 6 mile speed walk i run due to a knee injury daily combined with another form of exercise like weights plyometrics or a circuit course and elliptical every day for me thisis less about the ai and more about the menopause as i was surgically menopausal nine years prior to breast cancer and saw this issue long before i started on an ai hi everybody just wondering when will the lashes and brows be disappearing i am having 4 ac and 4 t treatments 3 weeks apart have finished the first 2 hair fell out right on schedule 2 weeks after first ac and my other question can anyone recommend a good eyebrow kit will be going to vegas after thanksgiving and i know there is a sephora store there so i might do some shopping thanks for any advice happy thanksgiving to everyone oxoxoxo kathy so i was fitted for a compression bra and sleeve worn them exactly 3 hours now and ready to cry not in pain but i am uncomfortable and feeling emotional i am having waves of lightheadedness and slight nausea but i assumed it was the tamoxifen will be donating my vs bras this was not discussed with me as part of my treatment plan but my ro referred me to physical therapy for lymphedema even though i having any issues i do have to admit that the physical therapy is helping to loosen up my scar tissue in my breast and under arm area the bra and sleeve are supposed to help with the continued post surgery and rads treatment healing when i asked how long i need these i was told just play this by ear just feeling frustrated over it all prayrv dream i know a list somewhere that lists the drugs that use the same pathway as tamoxifen dang chemo brain let me remember it though i think the occasional use is a problem dream i had my first taxol treatment on july 11th the next day i had some soreness in my toe and fingernails but then the next day i started having severe leg pains starting in my lower back and shooting up and down my legs randomly i called the dr and the prescribed me some hydrocodone but i have to take a bit in order to be comfortable now of course constipated i hope i have to go thru 2 months of this pain i heard it can last quite a while my first time with cancer i had adjuvant chemo adriamycin and cytoxan i lost my hair on the 18th day after my first treatment i was on zofran for nausea and that helped a lot but i did basically loose my appetite eat what sounds good some mornings i had soup for breakfast you need to drink as much as possible because the cytoxan is hard on your kidneys i found water with a little cranberry grape juice added tasted good get a cap turban to sleep in your head will get cold at night try to stay away from crowds during this time of year there are lots of colds flu sore throats etc and your immune system will be compramised from the chemo get a friend or relative to do your christmas shopping or order everything on line i continued to work during my treatment but some days it was hard thankfully i had some great employees who carried my load during the days i was having a hard time mainly i would just be exhausted and have brain fog once i finished chemo i was put on tamoxifen for five years my only side effect from that was hot flashes my onco prescribed a low dose of effexor and that stopped the hot flashes hope this helps hi i am new to this forumso i hope i am doing this right i was searching the web and came upon this post i too have recently been diagnosedwith hearing loss itwas recommended that i would benefit from hearing aids my tinnitus started about a year and a half ago and has progressively gotten worse i am 4 years 8 months into the tamoxifen 20 mg qdbut it is not listed as a side effect did not connect the possibility that it could be tamoxifen related until we started to rule out possible causes i have tolerated all the other side effects early menopause hot flashes weight gain leg cramps omg the leg cramps joint pain insomnia ect i have tolerated all this in silence but now i am miffed insurance will not pay for hearing aids unless it can be proven it was an oto toxic drug that caused the hearing loss was soooo glad to see this postand relieved to see i am not crazy with the notion that the tamoxifen could be and probably is the culprit has any one else had their hearing return after stopping the med and will this ringing ever stop i am so close to completing my 5 years well if nothing else thanks for listening if you can hear me above the constant ringing kirklandgirl and mimil thanks so much for your quick response and explaining the regular vs boosts and dosages it allowed me to ask my ro better questions sounds like our ros are giving us similar treatment taxol was a bear for me so i really researched radiation yet due to the taxol roller coaster i was on i am receiving a week break between final taxol and first rad due to the level of fatigue i had with taxol and becuase fatigue is one of the most common se with rads i am relaxing and resting up my rads will occur in the morning before i go to work so hoping that schedule works out thanks for the support and encouragement it is often given as in my case in combination with cyclophosphamide also called cytoxan together they are called a c since the trade name for doxorubicin is adriamycin not sure which one of the drugs caused the which of the side effects but susan experienced severe fatigue as a side effect and there was not much that could be done about that it also causes a drop in the white blood cells but they should give a rx for a drug called neupogen or neulasta for that an injection you give in the stomach a day or two after chemo hair loss is also one of the side effects some people experience nausea but they are pretty good at keeping that under control with a drug called emend so make sure they write a rx for it susan alsohad to take laxatives eat lots of fruit and vegetables and drink lots of water to keep her digestive system working sure others will respond with more helpful suggestions and i hope it goes well for your friend martin cp418 i have fibromyalgia and the 2nd opinion onc at dana farber suggested tamoxifen because of so many people suffering from bone pain from the arimidex frankly after reading about arimidex i want arimidex either plus i am at a high risk for a heart attack as i have diabetes high cholesterol and high blood pressure so looking at overall survival not just disease free survival arimidex is known to raise cholesterol peeps basia i posted this on another thread hope it helps a little there is no one size fits all for chemo both during and after i can only give you my experience but please know that your experience may be very different for me taxol was a walk in the park compared to ac during ac i was nauseous tired irritable and lost my appetite and my taste for most foods those 8 weeks were very difficult for me however they passed very quickly and ac seems like a lifetime ago now weekly taxol was quite easy and i had very few side effects i was able to eat everything and taste again and that was very exciting for me to the tune of an extra 10 lbs i know that had a lot to do with the weekly steroids the worst thing about taxol was the near loss of 6 fingernails the nail beds became discolored and the nails began to lift off the nail beds they have hung in there and i am done with treatment so i think they will make it the best thing was that my hair started growing back in around week 6 i am now almost 4 weeks post chemo and am starting to feel some bone and joint pain especially my upper legs hips and shoulders i did not experience this during chemo but have learned that quite common to feel this after taxol jules i did not have any problems with neuropathy but did have several nails lift i never lost them and they seem to be on the road to recovery now i never iced my hand or feet i had no issues at all with my toe nails any of ever just get angry out of nowhere thinking about this disease i am riding in the car thinking about renn healing maria with such full plate and melanie so young and just getting so mad you all talking about graduating from here must be in a better space than me i imagine not lurking around bc org i guess i need to change my thinking to what i am grateful for ugh maybe it is the tammy mood swings like supersally suggested really enjoyed my evening out last night with my oldest ds i have missed him this month and it was really nice to hang out i made a conscious effort not to converse about anything related to bc and i thought i was doing it for him but you know what it was healing for me like suebee says maybe it is getting back to me youngest ds hurt his knee hiking the at so we are headed to more docs next week for him he told me he think i go do a 5 day at hike i feel a challenge i wonder how long after exchange before we are considered normal physically heading back to vinyasa yoga on monday ps is not so happy about it but i can modify this gentle yoga cutting it renn thinking of you tons suebee safe travels nothing new here will have my 4th ac next thursday then on to dose dense taxol i am afraid of taxol and need to look some things up on it the worst things for me so far 1 the shock of losing my hair 2 the terrible hemmoroid i now have to deal with hurts so bad i am afraid to have a bm due to just one day of constipation 3 every two weeks just on schedule on the 9th day i get bad back and esophagus spasms which i have to take lots of valium and vicoden for 4 the 6th day tiredness and near depression 5 the need to keep foods in stomach at all times for the first 6 days or so after ac chemo other than that i have lots of good days even with dose dense no er room trips this session so far i hope you are all doing fine i will be so glad to get thru this no one seems to know what these back and espophagus spasms are but a woman sitting near me at chemo told me she had them too must be chemo or neupogen shot side effects they start the 9th day and last for 24 hours then they are gone my gastroenterologist told me that having had bc does put me at a slightly increased risk for colon cancer there is some controversy around this but i had a colonoscopy at age 43 for that reason question what about other side effects on tamoxifen i have had mild hot flashes on and off since starting it nothing compared to my chemopause days but i have had other side effects nausea the first week or two bruising for a few months oh and really bad anxiety attacks all gone now except the mild hot flashes i am assuming i am not in that 7 but i am wondering if anyone has read anything about flash ses i finished chemo march 31st and herceptin december 2nd i started feeling better almost immediately within two weeks however i get my full energy back for a while a process where you gradually get better and better 9 months past my last chemo i would say that now i probably have it back 90 i can finally stay up late and shop without getting tired etc my reds are still a little low but not enough to cause problems i still have the urge to take an afternoon nap but then i did before i got sick too i think my residual effects are probably from tamoxifen rather than chemo hot flashes every 30 minutes are a bit wearing and they frequently wake me up the the joint ache are tiring too developed a new side effect that i know what causes it i have suddenly developed acid reflux three times awakened in the middle of the night with acid washing up my throat burning it it feels like throwing up but not and it burns and makes me cough for hours weird next time i see my onc ask him but taking prilosec other than that pretty much back to normal next step is to get into an exercise program and build my strength back up i have to do pt for a shoulder problem so that might help get me moving i think be surprised how much better you feel as soon as chemo is done and it only goes up from there i had a great christmas and cooked a fabulous appetizer party for my family first time had the energy to do that in two years say it so well it so for me had 4 dd ac buzzed my hair down when it started to thin out the last little remnants which were all over my head did not go until i was into about my third weekly taxol when my brows and lashes went however after two weeks the little soft downy hair started growing in and my lashes popped out brows were coming in but slowly my hair grew all through taxol as did lashes and eye brows two weeks after my final taxol i ran my hand through my hair and came out with a bunch like it was thinning or been to the hairdresser who got me with thinning shears this continued for about a week or so it got me down in a way that losing it the first time never did no one had prepared me that it might happen and it was definitely chemo related but it stopped and my hair has continued to grow i never lost it all or looked like i was losing it all last taxol was this chemo stuff can be so arbitrary to you keeping you peach fuzz was on arimidex for 18 months and then had progression a recurrence in my sternum and t9 put on xeloda but taken off after 4 2 week treatments i thought it was too soon was to go on the faslodex zactima trial but when i had progression to liver and lungs was denied had radiation which shrank the bone tumors eventually went on abraxane and liver and lung tumors shrank by half had mixed results as far as the bone mets have been on aredia for a year and this bisphosphinate is doing its job healing bone get monthly shot am on tamoixifen now but had much success with hormonals i have nasty side effects like bone and joint pain and get the usual like hot flashes many thanks again for a most interesting post i think it is true that aggressive cancers respond well to chemotherapy but i do not think that it is always completely successful tnbc is considered aggressive but i think all cancers are aggressive to some degree i do not think it is any picnic being diagnosed as triple positive although i would think it is better now with access to the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab herceptin what a fight women here had to get it and it is said to cause heart problems i have a friend who has been treated for this and so far she is doing well i know that docetaxel taxotere is supposed to be very effective with triple negative nevertheless when i had my treatment with chemotherapy before surgery my oncologist told me that chemotherapy alone would not be sufficient on its own to deal with my breast cancer the taxotere did shrink the cancer but certainly not completely i needed the surgery and then the radiotherapy it is true that aggressive cells are really abnormal all any of us can do is keep our fingers crossed my oncologist is very good at discussing things with me and she did explain to me when i was asking about tnbc that my breast cancer did not necessarily begin with that receptor status she explained that cancer cells mutate doing research back in 2005 i read about breast cancers and how most tnbcs but not all are i then asked at the hospital whether mine was this was after i had finished my treatment and my tumour had been analysed and sent away for permanent storage i tend to think they had not looked for and given the percentage of triple negative breast cancer cases with characteristics i was told it probably was i also found out for myself that tnbc is a bit like genetic breast cancer the difference is that with the genetic the genes are already damaged but with tnbc the genes have somehow been silenced and cancer cells allowed to proliferate i remember reading about the p25 gene being silenced by a process known as methylation and thus allowing cancer cells to proliferate i remember in the early days all i wanted to know was what had caused my cancer because i had always looked after myself i wrote to professor karol sikora a well known and renowned oncologist and he told me to concentrate on the fact that i was in remission i think that was good advice however sam 52 and i think there was a possible connection between undiagnosed hyperparathyroidism and the development of breast cancer there is some swedish research to back this up i am quite sure that stress plays a part in the development of cancer i think it is probably something to do with unbalancing our hormones when we are stressed we have too much cortisol floating around people will tell you that their cancer developed after a long period of stress that was certainly my case it looks as though janette had put herself under a lot of stress finishing her thesis at the same time as she was trying to look after her seriously ill daughter she obviously overdid things i was most interested in the illness that the haematologist thought she had i must admit i had never heard of it i agree with you that she probably had cancer in her body and she obviously knew that something was wrong she was probably not having mammograms because on the nhs they start at 50 and are not always reliable anyway i do hope the children will get some tender loving care they do need it at this time is alex a boy or a girl i do hope you have a lovely time with alex and i do hope this thread is helping you thinking of you sylvia good morning ladies joni so glad you are feeling better i had heartburn during treatment and used gaviscon every time i ate it will only get better from here tic congratulations on being done i think not bad to be finished a day sooner less time to fret beforehand you can always stop in and see your nurses hot cold flashes mizsissy i think you are right yesterday the weather was warmer and i was cold all day someone had mentioned being worried about tamoxifen i went in yesterday to get my second pills wow time goes by i had any se except for some hot flashes and those have not been too bad so far told they do get better but i know women who have not had bc had a natural menopause who have had lots of hot flashes night sweats the doc gave me a presc for effexor but i filled it i want to take anything else unless the heat becomes really disruptive lynn i can see them being worse when it gets hot hopefully the wig will be gone by then we get a lot of heat until july yesterday i went for a walk and the sun came out no one was around so i took off my hat it felt great then some one did walk by and they give me a second look i also think that my hair is stunted around the hairline because of the wig so going without it more and more my husband was speaking with one of his secretaries yesterday and mentioned that i had had bc he said he felt an impulse to tell her well she had too must be awhile ago she had chemo and is not on tamoxifen anyway they talked about how the dhs want to fix it and fix it now and then it should stay fixed did him good to hear that her dh was the same way but she told him that better to just listen i think i have said that about 100 times but somehow hearing it from some one else is different have a good day every one we are off to the zoo today just saw this post and it has some great info my mom was initially put on anastrozole in and stayed on it until 2011 the anastrozole caused severe diarreha so she switched to letrozole in 2011 she was only only letrozole for months because she developed an issue with severe pain in her pinky finger and thumb same hand came off letrozole and onto exemestane in but developed diarreha hand pain and depression so in she made the decision to go off all hormone therapy interesting that many of you report the joint hand feet pain with these meds certainly what my mom experienced her bone density test and bone scan in showed slight osteopenia so she has been taking a calciumwith vitamin d supplement since then she was taking it daily but due to high vitamin d in she is now taking this every other day pet scan in 2011 and bone scan in showed ned and her tumor markers remain okay so for now no meds except the calcium with vitamin d supplement otter thanks so much for the table actually my 1st tx was my second was and my third was the third was delayed a few days because my urinalysis indicated a possible infection but after the culture was done it was determined i had no infection if all goes on schedule my fourth will be we had to delay that a few days because i will be going to my only high school graduation i told my oncologist i miss that for anything yesterday went fairly well except with problems accessing my port they say i have a very positional port so sometimes it takes getting me into a special position before everything will flow correctly and yesterday was one of those days i actually had to lay all the way back in the recliner before everything worked properly but thankfully it did and we got started today i actually feel too bad just very tired thanks to the drenching hot flashes which i had all last night just love those wonderful steriods i am off to the cancer center in about hour to get my neulasta shot my oncologist believes very strongly that i need this each time to keep up my counts since i am a teacher i am thankful that he does this since i am around all of those germs with the first shot i had terrible bone pain and i even had to take my darvocet with the second it was much better and advil was able to cover it so hopefully this third one will be even better thus far i have a few stomach issues but my emmend that expensive little pill has seemed to take care of that it just seems like my side effects seem to kick in three to four days after treatment for example three days after the second treatment i developed the hand and foot syndrome which was a reaction to the taxotere the bottoms of my feet turned bright red and were swollen they were actually hot to touch and i felt like i was walking on broken glass thankfully that lasted only about four days and then it moved to my hands which lasted about two with the first treatment about four days after treatment i developed such severe diarrhea that i ended up in our cancer center twice in two days on iv fluids because i was so dehydrated so hopefully this round proves much less eventful for those ladies who have asked about hair loss by day 11 after my first treatment my hair started coming out and by two days after my second treatment it was coming out so bad that i decided to shave my head it just made things so much easier i was tired of hair being everywhere i have three wigs which i trade off and on they are very similiar in style and color when at home i just wear bandanas which i have purchased at walmart for less than a dollar you can get them in a wide variety of colors and styles and they are very comfortable i just want to thank all of you who have responded to my comments with their thoughts and support it definitely makes this journey much easier you see this is the second time for me to do this fifteen years ago i was diagnosed with breast cancer on the right side and now i have been diagnosed on the left side i say that the second time is any easier but it has definitely helped knowing that i can come to this site and ask questions and get such postive comments thank you very much senora as far as the taxotere and nails go i have heard that you can either ice your nails or use dark nail polish something about the light hitting the nails makes them suseptible to the drugs effects the ice just keeps the drugs from fulling hitting that area while you are getting the infusion so if you want to freeze to death while getting your infusion you may want to just paint your nails i do know that if you eat ice chips while getting the infusion that you get the mouth sores or the swollen gums at least that was my experience the first chemo treatment i ever got i never did the ice chips and had mouth sores and swollen gums then from there on out i ate the ice chips during each infusion and never had to use that magic mouth wash ever again i did try the ice on the eye brows lashes to try and save them so far they have thinned out a good bit but i still have them but i never had bushy eyebrows or thick eye lashes to begin with so i was trying really hard to keep what i had on the taxotere i have started to experience muscle fatigue and aches to a great extent going up stairs has started to become a huge chore and this is coming from someone who works out on a regular basis even throughout chemo has anyone else experienced this so far my last chemo treatment was and on i will be having my first consult with the radiologist to start rads i also get to start my little pill of tamoxifen at the same time i start rads i hope everyone continues to do well through chemo taxol was as you say tearing up my intestine for a week as well i was absolutely miserable from my mouth to the rectum was constantly inflamed 2 weeks ago my nd recommended taking and i have to say my gi issues are about 75 better i use a powdered form from jarrow formulas the recommendation was to take 2 grams 2x day for 2 weeks then 2 grams day until the end of taxol my onc said that since glutamine is basically a food there will be no interaction with the taxol or herceptin and is safe to take the most abundant amino acid in the human body is involved in many metabolic processes including the synthesis and protection of muscle tissue the production of glycogen and immune support during periods of immune and muscular stress is also a major source of fuel for enterocytes intestinal cells and hence supports the integrity of the intestinal lining liability though dropping a 5 lb weight on your foot is going to hurt you whether in sandals or a sneaker crazy because walked thousands of miles in just my current pair of tevas with no problems ah well i went to the fancy shoe place and paid a lot for athletic shoes with as big a toe box as i can find in a too large try them on my treadmill tonight and see how my toes are by morning i have toe on both feet index toe longer than big toe plus wide feet that are at an angle due to a mild congenital defect so closed toe shoes are always painful after a very short time if these can take me through minutes of treadmill okay acceptable i imagine that sandals or unconstructed yoga things are not permitted for aerobics and zumba tamoxifen does really decrease my frustration tolerance it was hard not to cry all afternoon after going to the gym to sign up and seeing the rule just before we signed for a year hello september gals pardon my intrusion but i started in late aug 27th so i am very close in timing to many of you i just wanted to chime in on the hair issue i cut mine from shoulder length to chin length prior to chemo but was not yet ready to buzz it down on saturday day 16 it started shedding basically when i run my hands through my hair many strands come out and of course a ton comes out in the shower the shedding is continuing but i still have enough to cover my head with no bald spots though i think the part on top of my head is getting more pronounced as the hair thins stray hairs are everywhere and i am probably going to end up having my husband shorten it with the clippers sometime in the next couple of days the longest guard on the clippers is 1 so i think i will start there so i can adjust to it and then i can always clip it shorter later also i was interested to see that one of you mac 5 is on abraxane i was originally scheduled for tch but after having an allergic reaction to the taxotere i am now doing acx 4 and then abraxane so i am curious about the of abraxane since it is not discussed as much on these boards good luck to all of you ladies we will get through this vicimjones i also think it depends on the day for example met with my ex separated partner whatever he is at this point in time and he commented on how good my colour was etc and i did not feel offended maybe the comment from both meant in contrast to oher people who are looking pale lately i do not look pale or maybe it is relief that i look healthy and they have been worried your comments here also made me think and reflect on my reactions i guess what i qant is to be asked how are you just that there is a fella at work who asks me every few weeks and really listens to my answer because if someone asks me i tell them i appreciate him asking and sometimes he will say simply you look tired go easy with yourself today and then walks away and i actually appreciate that too oddly enough but most people do not ask or comment at all or they tell me that i am strong perhaps just enquire but to reiterate what others have said here this is really jus a place we vent it may not strike us as anything at all at the time somethign is said but then by the end of the day when fatigue hits and the emotional low of tamoxifen or sadness or a pityparty take over yowser then we think hmm that stung i have told people i work with two people i sing with many of my friends but not my acquaintances and it is not something i want swirling around the efl world it is like a small town where everyone knows everyone else s business and if people who know any better fear breastcancer is alwaysa death sentence i do not want them to know i know that will change know i am only partially down this road but right now it is my business and that of people i choose to share it with i too put on my tough kid act from many years ago and tell people matter of factly about it most people can deal with it if i deal with it in that manner but certainly my employer and his daugher whom i work close with donot want to hear about it think it scares the crap out of them how can this strong healthy woman have had cancer this year what about me ah life welcome to this forum found a lot of great advice and support here hope you do too to answer you question about a month after starting tamox i developed serious problems with insomnia i had problems sleeping every night for over six weeks yuck it was a real challenge but it got better i also had some anxiety which was contributing to the problem so i tried some things to help me relax meditation etc and talked to a counselor to work through the anxiety issues as an fyi there have been a couple other threads on insomnia one in this topic and i believe one or two in other topics i remember some women also tried things like acupuncture so if interested you might find other helpful advice if able to search for insomnia good luck lack of sleep is a serious problem hi ladies as aways i learn so much from reading your posts my mom 2 has left mast in late sept hormone negative herp negative 9 of 23 nodes positive we were worried that the docs would not want to treat the cancer due to age but most advised an aggressive treatment plan she is scheduled for 4x ac 4x t and then 30 radiation my mom had very few side effects with her first treatment of ac constipation some fuzzy brain mostly days 2 3 she is give emend and steroids for three days she has zofran every 12 hours and lorizapam to fill in if breakthrough nausea she has not taken any zofran yet my mom had her second ac treatment last th nov 30 she has not been nauseous yet but the tiredness is there and she has virtually no appetite she sounds weak on the phone her hair is coming out she has a couple of scarves and a wig she should receive some items i ordered from tlc in a couple of days mom is in the hospital she fell and broke her arm shortly after her first ac treatment totally unrelated to chemo the pain from the humerus fracture was unmanagable at home i am relieved that she is in the hospital since she has good care and i am 3 hours away what do you suggest for the no appetite issue what seems to work for those of you who have had this challenge thanks for the information i share some of the posts from this site with mom we both appreciate being part of this group all the best to you janet way to go yeah you get the cheer of the century for that one 2 years out i still have the energy i had i seem to still ache everywhere my back and my ankle hurt and they say are left over neuropathy from taxotere my arms ache and swell slightly probably slight lympodema as a result of all this and the tumor they are watching on my pituitary i am on ss dis because i work yep get on with your life get me wrong alive and very grateful for that just expect me to be the same i am different and apparently will always be the treatment does come with consequences pat i love your poem you in accounting you definitely have a strong creative side lisa is the pain any better audra does your wig have velcro adjusters you could loosen a little paulette thank you thank you lisa smrlvr wallymama i too spent some time reading on the ilc board you all mentioned in earlier posts i agree with lisa about there being a definite need for better diagnosing too few doctors are savvy about ilc with more education on part so many of our ilc cancers could be found earlier wallymama how are you feeling your progress and mri results are exciting smrlvr how are you doing after your treatment jab thanks for the good reminders about perspective i see in some of our posts that some of us know they are having their ovaries removed wondering how each of you came to that decision game to have anything and everything that could cause me trouble removed i have the brca mutation and the geneticist said she think it was common practice where being treated to removed ovaries prophylactically i think i remember my np saying be tested during radiation to see if really gone through menopause i guess gearing up to ask my mo her thoughts on whether or is more effective to prevent recurrence mets for ilc been hanging on the couch for nearly 5 days with too many aches to move i think i might be feeling ever so slightly better this afternoon i hate how neulasta makes everything so much worse on the other hand it works just this morning i got the actual numbers from my last labs when i taken neulasta and they were soooooooo low if known the actual numbers last week i would have felt worse i might ask if i can do neulasta after my last chemo after all just so radiation be delayed re neuropathy my thumbs and first two fingers still hurt but not worse i saw a website refer to neuropathy causing difficulty with fiddly things yup i have difficulty opening the ziploc on the costco sliced cheese changing earrings with posts buttoning jeans and texting on my old slider phone i could live with it like this but not any worse i think if it gets better over the next week stay on track to do my last dd taxol if it improve or gets worse need to consider reducing the last treatment body only one more i hope everyone gets cozy or cool and has a good sleep hieveryone just checking to ask how everyone doing hope getting to the other side of final cycle and starting to feel better its 3 and a bit weeks since my last treatment and recovery is slow but sure i will be starting on anastrozole very soon i met a women the other day at haven who is on the same and she told me to look forward to joint pain and mild hot flushes with this i can cope on a positive note my hair is really stating to grow back ive even driven without a hat scarf but not been quite brave enough to walk out without just yet but if it keeps growing at this rate it wont be long my sick note expires 13th may and everyone keeps telling me way too soon to go back to workbut i am anxious to get my life back my only fear is going back to a stressful job too soon and ending up going off sick again my oncologist put things inperspective recently by reminding me that ive had major surgery mastectomy and 6 months ofchemotherapy which puts the body under immense strain he gave thebestadvice to listen to and be kind to myselfand allow recovery to happen as it needs to guess i should start a new thread in the living with and beyond bit on the forum but not before we have raised a glass together on here are we ready girls lots of love xx i gained about 10 lbs over the whole surgery chemo rads chemopause expereince but i have not gained further weight on tamoxifen actually i have lost weight in the past 3 months been on the tamox for 15 months but i attribute it to exercise and a better diet i am done with chemo my last treatment was today i talked to the physician he is under my oncologist and told him of the difficulties with taxol and he said i am never going to tell another patient that taxol is easier than a c because i am hearing that so many are having problems with excruciating pain on taxol yeah they are listening to us whine artemis i demanded a 10 mg of valium before they sent me down for the shots in the nipple for my snb that took the edge off but the lidocane still burns as they are pushing it in you luckily after that you feel a thing i have an extreme low tolerance for pain and i tell each and every doctor that i see about this as if i have more pain than i can handle i just pass out apple congrats on getting an organ my mom deceased used to play the organ my grandmother taught her and even today my grandma who is 94 years old still plays the organ on the nail issue i never painted my nails just figured that getting oxygen to them would help my nails never turned black just a dark orange and then the tips of them kept getting wider and wider the white part start growing back towards the cuticles i have 4 nails where the white goes back a lot further than it should personally i really care as i was never one to polish my fingernails unless i was going to a wedding funeral or celebrating my wedding anniversary i am so very thankful that i gotten any neuropathy symptoms at all i know if it is the daily does of 100 mg of gabapentin or maybe that se just hit me i am on a steroid high right now so my husband is more than happy to have me gone as much as possible as now is the time that i will tear into him if he even looks at me the wrong way he be safe from my wrath until saturday at the soonest if i am feeling bad from the pain i will just take my morphine pills and hide in my bedroom the entire time sleeping and watching tv he even asked tonight if he should sleep on the futon in the basement area because of the massive amount of steroids i have in me i think he is as elated as i am that no more steroids no more chemo just down to surgery radiation and reconstruction loubar they mentioned nothing about this though i did read in the forums here some get told you lose weight and some get told you gain still trying to shed my chemo weight and though moving in the right direction only 2 lbs down for me there continues to be fuzzy headed ness and minor short turn memory issues i keep leaving the stove on etc i get hot flashes regularly mostly disturbing my sleep just started taking black cohosh which is supposed to help i was super achy the first 30 days or so on tamoxifen but it seems to have subsided considerably even that was just like having frozen up and moving ok but getting moving from a standstill the achy part the more i exercise the better i feel rash is subsiding my onco nurse checked with oncologist and he said benadryl ok for ths very short time but i can only take at night as it knocks me out myers are you on hormonal treatment an ai or tamoxifen i had a terrible time with memory loss and confusion while i was on arimidex i was on it for 14 months and went off it and onto aromasin the difference was amazing i got my brain back can cause chemo brain too even though they chemo trish i had the fec and then taxotere 3 x each 3 weeks apart it is doable and as others have said everyone reacts differently mostly with each of them i was tired the first week or so and then better each of the remaining two weeks you can carry on with most of your usual day but plan to scale back on what you do also get something to deal with the inevitable constipation right away i am retired and have to choose whether to work or not and am glad because not working made it much more possible to rest as needed it alsowas a good ideato hire a cleaning service during chemo so as not to waste your good days with housework i was lucky with the taxotere and have many of the side effects except for some fatigue and some bone muscle aches good morning lovely liver ladies hope it is a good one for you all welcome to diane 50 and best wishes for good results on your biopsy welcome also to modum interested to see if your biopsy reveals a change in the er pr her status my original diagnosis was er pr her liver mets are triple negative so hormone therapy did nothing for that on navelbine now and doing really well with it taxol usually works well for liver mets also but i understand the hair loss issue i also work full time and wore a wig for a year living in south texas not very comfortable lolpenny it sounds like god may be leading you to find a fresh set of eyes to look at you i know you hear his heart and will follow sending prayers your way for relief from the diverticulitis woodylb to your pet on monday continuing to show no tumors it looks like they have the right cocktail mixed for you wishing you all the best my friend ronniekay thanks for the good wishes on my upcoming ct scans i took my second infusion on monday and this one kicked me back a bit but i have the next two weeks off so i can build back up had abit of a scare with pneumonia again but my pulmonary doc jumped right on it i love him and has me on strong antibiotics and steroids as well as nebulizer treatments 4 times a day he thinks we can kick this in the butt from home and not go back to the hospital feeling better already after just a couple of doses of meds so woohoo best wishes to all for a great weekend debbie tim i had such terrible pain after 2 taxol treatments that i considered stopping my onc switched me to taxoterre and there was no more pain the culprit seems to be not the taxol itself but the cremaphore solutionin which it is mixed taxoterre is mixed in a different solution and abraxane newest form of tax is mixed in albumin which naturally occurs in the body i believethere are no pre meds required other than anti nausea with abraxane because there is no cremaphore to cause adverse reactions vicodin although very effective at relieving pain has the side effect of constipation and the possibility of drug dependence aleve otc is an and may be a good alternative to tylenol etc prayers are going up here for your wife i hope she gets relief from the pain soon nico my wife was on taxotere and cytoxan she started treatment in january ans was able to get three of her treatments but has really bad side effects she got the last dose on and had three trips to the hospital in march her doctor said she could not give her the last dose she has been on oxygen because the taxotere gave her hypoxia and she is having to use a scooter because she can not walk due to severe back knee and foot pain she also has neuropathy where even water from the shower hurts when it hits her skin she has now developed a rash on the lower parts of her legs and feet and is have problems with dizziness does anyone know how long these side effect will last hello ladies after a year of tamoxifen my blood work showed me to be very menopausal so my onc switched me to arimidex after 3 weeks on it i seem to have the same ses i had on tamoxifen hot flashes joint aches decreased energy and weight gain now the skin on my hands itches and some parts appear red is this urticaria i am off to the onc next week in any case but wondered if anyone else had this symptom and what if anything helped you i am a harpist so this hand thing is really bothering me thanks barb z 2 years out and reconstruction last week i took tamoxifen for 2 years and 2 months fatigue was my number one complaint followed by hot flashes and persistent nausea anytime i exceeded a ridiculously low level of activity my fatigue is still plagueing me however and i stopped the tamoxifen in january i have reason to believe that my thyroid has been out of balance since radiation not that i can get any help from my doctors i even get my oncologist to test my tsh levels have your thyroid levels been tested by anyone get copies of your results if you have standards changed in 2002 which changed normal tsh results from at the upper limit to and even at that most women feel best when their tsh is and typical for women to suffer hypothyroidism for a long time before anyone bothers to do anything about it has been much harder than fec and in talking to to be similar se bone joint pain was really bad after i stopped the have any prescription painkillers but now will have some for the next one it is a strange sore and fatigue it seems like i am coming out the end of the is one week since the chemo and days since the se seems to be in line with what the oncologist had told me to expect in would have asked for a prescription of painkillers just being said i hate taking anything more than i have to imagine what my kidney liver are going to look like after this chemo this stuff must do a number on them i just keep thinking 2 more then 1 then gosh what will i do with my time then oh yeah spend it in radiation hi linda sorry you are joining us but know that have loads of support on the boards i did weekly taxol years ago with my original diagnosis and it too bad more recently i did stepsister abraxane which was slightly awful but still doable one of the rougher side effects is neuropathy which seems to vary widely depending on the person fatigue is pretty rough too so if you are able to take it easy plan on it big hugs to you wish you here but we are with you 110 on tamoxifen i tried various times of taking it and it never seemed to make a difference i had sucky sleep and terrible hot flashes other than that nothing big until my pap smear came back with endometrial cells in it which normal that ended my t run onc and ob gyn switched me to i arimidex after talking i sleep better a little and hot flashes are hugely better not too many sweaty ones joint pain was really bad and now i have de quearvans tendonitis which i am convinced is related to the ai when i researched it too many people on ai had the same thing speaking of that i am finally going to go with the ortho docs suggestion that i get a cortisone shot in my wrist not getting better with pt and the tendon movement stops me in my tracks it is so painful so for any of you that have had a wrist cortisone shot how painful is it you would think after all the surgeries that would be a small thing but the kind of stuff that freaks me out stitches coming out ouch expander needle painful so dreading this the message the assistant left said it wasnt critical to have someone drive me home but it might be nice that worried me a little i had dd taxol x4 and for me it was somewhat uneventful neck pain bone pain some constipation and fatigue no nausea or vomiting just started ac 1 done 1 tomorrow and 2 more after that and it too has not been too bad for me hope you fare the same as we are all different wish you well maggie hi claire the effects are basically the same as going into the menopause but immediately rather than slowly as you would with a natural menopause i had zoladex with my primary when i was 41 and i must say the hot flushes were awful but did gradually improve after the 1st 12 months sorry this be what you want to hear it will depend how old you are as well because the nearer you are to your natural menopause the less severe the symptoms tend to be be careful though about taking any supplements especially those with in i e plant oestrogen the out as to whether this would feed hormone positive bc or stop it worth checking with your oncologist or bcn about anything they say you can have nicky x hello it ok that i join i am starting arimidex on day my onc told me to start it on the 1st i just had my ovaries and tubes out on monday so although only 40 in full blown menopause already the chemo had stopped my period anyway and had horrible hot flashes for a year now because of that been on tamoxifen since august and have experienced mild joint pain and stiffening but when i tested positive for the breast cancer gene they decided to remove the ovaries and here i am seriously hoping i experience the horrible never been good with heartburn not against going on something to help it one more pill note that many oncologists do not recommend the test that is marketed to measure ability to metabolize tamoxifen not sure if that is what orange 1 is talking about but if it is your doctormay not suggest it i am trying to remember what my oncologist said when i asked aboutthe testa year or so ago i think that she said that it had not been fully tested and that there was too great a chance for contamination there is a thread on the subject somewhere on the board i think that the title is something like test to metabolize tamoxifen regarding the femara i suggest talking to your oncologist re switching to tamoxifen or simply trying to put up with the femara for a couple of years then switching i did five years on tamoxifen and have made through 2 years of femara my goal is to make to three years then try for four i have joint pain but do have hair thinning tamoxifen was much easier for me but some have problems with it as well good luck but take a look at the stats before you give up on sue oh please misunderstand not saying that fundraisers are bad only talking about the one here that seemed to be unadvertised only bc survivors were there so it seemed the only onesgettingawarenesswere already in the know about cancer hopefully other bmw events are better planned in comparison last year i spent the whole race for the cure at the education booth giving out the keychains that said i am the cure on them the only way people could get one was to answer some questions for me there was a wheel they could spin and it landed on a question the answers were on the table so that they could see them this was amazing and i loved doing it i feel i helped educate hundreds of people that day for example the question what are the two biggest risk factors for cancer was answered wrong by about 99 of people they all said family history and i got to say i had an aggressive cancer and i have no family history and you could tell it sunk in no one is safe from this disease the correct answer is being a woman and getting older and we always get great tv coverage at the race from our abc station what i mean about raising awareness vs not raising awareness when it comes to fundraisers slapping a pink ribbon on a product is not always a guarantee that for the right reason the company then needs to make sure the message is getting to those who need to hear it stand in the hot sun for hours with my painful feet if i think i can educate someone before take an air conditioned ride around the block in a luxury car if no one knows why doing it unless they let me drive with a bullhorn out the window actually that would be wonderful get a mammogram one in eight women will get breast cancer as i go down the road interested to hear how other events are done across the country do you all feel that the message is getting out to the general public sharont my onc changed me from 4 ac then 4 taxol w herceptin to 6 tch taxotere carboplatin herceptin at the last minute he said for her 2 the taxotere is easier on the heart than the adriamiacin when taking herceptin andprovenjust as effective igo every week for my herceptin during the 18 weeks then i will get it every 3 weeks until nov 2008 i will start rads about a month afterthe last chemo cocktail in mid feb my onc didnt say how many yet it ismy understanding that the rads depend on where they find the tumors and if they are near any muscles or if you dont have a total mast since i had a partial the rads are necessary taxotere seems to be gentler than a also because the hair takes longer to fall out and the nausea is not as bad i started to shed by day 16 but didnt lose it in clumps until after my 2nd tx my dh used the wahl clippers to shave mine off and i have some stubble and some patches of bald i am thinking of going to a barber shop to get it shaved my dh shaves his head and i have see nicks and scrapes on his skin afterwards so i do not want him to touch mine i am not sure if it is the chemo working on the hormones or what but i am so emotional now i never was one to cry at movies or weep over spilled milk but now i cry at the drop of a hat i teared up in church during the sermon i started to cry watching a movie last night really weird reasons to tear up jen i also have been getting nose bleeds my last bloodwork had my platelets at 84 they should be greater than 150 so i figured that to be my problem i have been all stuffed up since my mom came to visit so i think i will call my family dr to get him to look up there and see what might be going on i love this site we get such good info on here i am feeling good today and it seems the winds have died down just a little snow on the ground i think i will venture out for some fresh air cheryl good morning ladiesits a very frosty but sunny day here so should be a nice day heather

computer seems to be similar to the ones on taxol but i will have to see what my oncologist says next week i really hope i can just go straight to rads even though the side effectsare tiredness glad

holiday as they seem to be on here lately come on girls back to the thread so we can see what you havebeen up to missing you all going back to typing now or at least trying to annie angelbaby i did taxotere not taxol but did experience 10 body aches at times i used dilaudid and it worked fine without making me high it did cause constipation though took 2 stool softners everytime i took some dilaudid i hope you find something that works for you and feel like an addict you have to endure pain melanie glad you have a pe the treatment sucks shot in the belly everyday for 6 months minimum and the stuff burns like hell jcoutee have you tried emend amazing for nausea expensive but it the best tried so far without causing constipation praying for all of you wonderful ladies keep kicking cancers ass i have chemo tomoro and onc visit i wonder if my dose will be changed due to the blood clot problem i took 4 ac and 4 dd taxol on number 2 i did not think i would loose my nails with only 4 treatments but they feel really sensative does icing really help this really upsets me for some reason most so than the hair because we where sandals here all the time what else can be done to helpwith the nails i am having bone pain off and on and just started with the neo in the left foot i dread 3 treatment asthe bone pain seems to last longer juls i did feel that taxol was easier i had less of that off and nausea feeling but i did have a bit of joint aches and pains on days 4 and 5 and by that time the fatigue had caught up a bit so i was tired and i really needed the pepcid along with prilosec i was lucky and have any nail problems or neuropathy forget to take the supplements to prevent it carnitine l glutamine and vit b 6 to be honest though i got through ac pretty easily i had treatment on wednesday and we went out for dinner every friday night even the onesafter treatment except one time when both dh and i were not feeling great every now and then my dh complains about something hurting or not feeling good and i remind him of just how tough i am and that he needs to just suck it up he not going to get much sympathy from me for a little ache or pain by the way some of you have talked about diet coke not tasting so good during treatment i am 8 weeks pfc and just now starting to taste normal not sure what it is that makes it taste so funky although i got to the point where anything carbonated was off limits we have an rv yet we camped in tents and popups for many years when our kids were young then when we moved to the kansas city area we borrowed or rented rvs many times and went to lots of great places grand canyon mt rushmore badland zion bryce etc and when our daughter went off to college in oregon and we were living in ct we flew to san francisco rented an rv and drove up along the coast into oregon and crater lake dropped her off then came back down through reno and yosemite can you tell i like national parks our long range plan is to do rving fulltime as soon as dh can stop working for health insurance now that been approved for ssdi it could happen in a couple of years glad to know not the only one with lower back pain not that i want anyone else to suffer but it is obviously a side effect speaking of which i saw my endo today hypothyroid and he said chemo is really bad for your bones no duh but then he told me it usually effects two places on the spine first the hump up top where you see little old ladies bend over and the lower back right where i feel those horrible spasms so i wonder if maybe my muscles are cramping because the bone density is changing there i go to the gym and do heavy lifting because of all the germs and hard to work that part of the body with resistance at home resistance weight training helps build slow bone loss hope not it i also saw my onc pretty young i told him about the acetyl and he never heard of it before so he looked it up and the national cancer institute in phase 3 of a study using it for taxotere neuropathy which is what i told him but he had to check heh he told me it was fine and i left an empty bottle with him so maybe recommend it to others and he wrote me a scrip for b6 he also told me i will just have to suck up the taxotears and been really bad this week but no bloody nose this time see what the opthomologist says next week when i meet with him probably same thing i go for 5 on tuesday and while i felt fantastic last week this week tired and grumpy i was on femara for 6 mo went off it because of severe joint muscle pain and bone loss loss of hair fatigue depression bladder problems femara is known to be hard on bones i now have osteoporosis in my spine my experience everyone is different though how we tolerate these hi everyone mandy i think you should listen to what your oncologist says in that everyone has a different story and situation i had to have zoladex for 2 years but that was because i was early stage stage 2 no lymph node involvement mastectomy other people are on it for much longer my experience with tamoxifen has been that the side effects are easier to live with than the side effects from zoladex i found it so hard that even 2 years felt like forever but i did get to the end and its worth it lets face it having cancer is way way worse my periods have started again so i know about people who are on zoladex for 10 yrs and then are in menopause maybe if you are in the real menopause its more gradual or a little bit more forgiving as its the body being natural on zoladex it always felt totally artificial if that make sense like my body had been shut down and knew it had been dezdi had some side effects from the tamoxifen but for me the zoladex was the really hard one its really worth trying to stick with it the mood swings for me get any easier i just gritted my teeth on a daily basis and tried not to loose the plot it was less like mood swings and more like one big rotten mood lisa hi liz i switched from arimidex back to tamoxifen this past may i experienced terrible joint pain and headaches from the arimidex i got such relief even after just 1 week off that damn stuff i had no other side effects to speak of feel free to pm me tina good evening everyone sorry i completely missed some of the chats on zoladex ali i said i have no but i do not have much interest in sex too and i get hot flushes but i guess having 2 young kids under 3 means that so tired in the eve that i really want sex and have no problem sleeping re gene testing i have 2 daughters so i would definetely get tested once my treatment ends one a more positive note one of my friends was dx at 25 with bc she got pregnant 3 years after her treatment then she had a second bc in the other breast and also felt pregnant a second time after treatment there is hope out there for hot flushes tried acupuncture also helps with sleeping and with stress for those of you in london hereford and leeds had a lot of support from breast cancer heaven check they deal with the emotional support needed for bc and offer lots of complementary therapies to help with side effects of treatments good luck to all and stay positive hi i was diagnosed with er 8 in march 2013 i had chemotherapy first then surgery and started tamoxifen in september 2013 my periods stopped around the time of my 2nd chemo in february this year i had very light spotting brown that lasted around 2 days in march pretty much 4 weeks later i had the same maybe slightly heavier in april again around 4 weeks later i had a really heavy period for 2 days all fine again this is how my periods used to be although not has heavy as the april period my concern is that as i was strongly er positive should i be concerned that the tamoxifen working or is this just my body returning to normal anyone with any experience of this i will ring my bc nurse but when i spoke to them in march they said not to worry as it did sound like my period was coming back now 43 and only to be concerned if it was unexplained bleeding for a long period outside of the cycle is this worry never ending not helped by me watching the c word at the weekend as having serious wobbles again thanks for reading and i hope someone out there give advise kind regards diana hi everyone mrs mc when i read your posting i felt so emotional i can totally empathise with what you are saying its perfectly natural as you know to worry about it coming back had two primary cancers now in the same breast and all sorts of questions have gone round my head its horrible because we want the professionals to tell us its cured and we are fine but in reality as with just about all cancers certainly from my consultants explanations they never like to say people are cured and sure its not because we but more because they never know what might happen to anyone in the future i too try and be positive as much as is feasible but at the end of the day i think we are all entitled to have our down days after all we have been through so much physical and emotional turmoil i hope your 2nd tax went okay just think only one more to go debs great to hear your doing okay its hard to believe where the time has gone babs when do you have your last tax mine is 19th may then tamoxifen my eyes have settled down a bit but my tongue is horrific sheena great to hear from you glad the too bad for you must admit suffered worse with tax than fec but only one more to go then tamoxifen for me hope everyone else is doing okay love and hugs krissy xx i just celebrated my 5 year anniversary of being in remission i was diagnosed with stage iia triple negative breast cancer i had a mastectomy and 4 rounds of a c as well as 12 rounds of taxotere my eyes starting watering during the taxotere rounds all my oncologist said was that it would go away when i reached the 3 year mark my eyes were still watering 2 ophthalmologists said oh this is a well known side effect of taxotere and offered no solutions my optometrist did the most thorough exam ever and said my puncta were blocked he referred me to anoculofacial plastic and reconstructive surgeon her fellowship was done at johns hopkins hospital apparently at hopkins the oncology and opthamology departments work together closely so as to prevent the problems of which you and i are complaining she attempted a surgery but it was unsuccessful now here i am at 5 years and my eyes continue to water like a faucet it may sound like nothing to most people but i can assure you that constantly watery eyes is no joke irene hi pinkpockets and paamboli have you considered taking an pinkpockets if you could find a good one that worked for you you might be able to stay on tamoxifen paamboli maybe one would work for you too i have two close friends who have had breast cancer and they used celexa to help them battle depression there are numerous drugs out there that might help you with this particular side effect i am considering taking it myself as i have noticed that the ais make me more blue anxious in any event i wish you well on your journey best beau currently on recovery week so the next few days i feel pretty good the three weeks when on taxol i feel like shit i like the decadron i always say here for the steroid i also take 20 mg night before taxol infusion do you all look at your blood work i have had 30 infusions but after a few months the taxol started to delete my magnesium if i am or below i get iv mag my onc also gives me iv fluids the 3rd day after infusion to keep up hydration i always feel better after fluids the last month my whites were low so got neupogen the shots really help when counts are low fatigue is the outcome my doc has perimeters around all blood work so the chemo nurses know when to give what i am supplementing with slow mag which if you take oral mag it can give you diareahha hydrate the last three years with mets had been so tough i lost kidney function last july but the taxol saved my kidneys and started working right away i was a huge road bike athlete but now all i can do is walk neuropathy is very bad in my feet and fingers my social life is a memoryi hate cancer but i love life reasons to stay alive along side all the losses my nephew graduates from high school june 1 and i will fly to minneapolis for that i pray for stability or ned so i can get an easier tx hang in people what we go through on a daily basis no one knows some days i feel like quitting other days no hope for all less side effects i just finished 8 of 12 weekly taxol herceptin today i am blessed to continue to have few side effects still have normal taste buds no chemo brain no nausea or pain anywhere no nail or mouth issues just the usual sleep issues from the steroid and constipation pink or red clots when i blow my nose but no actual bloody nose minor neuropathy in my feet but taking b6 and to counteract i hope all of you continuing on to weekly taxol will also be blessed with such mild effects on the downside i have gained about 7 or 8 pounds over the 8 weeks i sure expecting that i also learned this week that my thanksgiving hostess of many years has early disease we all knew something was going wrong for her over a period of years but still the diagnosis in someone so young 65 is shocking she has decided she host thanksgiving this year even with everyone bringing all the food so another one of the group will host sometimes change sucks jojo good luck on your upcoming treatment mariposa and others with a blog can you put a link to your blog on your signature line here betsy when i was on tamoxifen my periods got further apart shorter and lighter my periods never stopped on it my oncologist told me that the closer you are to natural menopause the more likely it is that your periods will stop i did have ovarian cysts while i was on tamo i hope you get a satisfactory answer if i had to guess say that it is your body getting used to the tamo best wishes i am 39 and had a total hyster ooph at the end of october it is so great to read comments this is a big procedure for anyone and although i am young and consider myself healthy even with bc it has been a tougher and longer recovery than i expected i was back at work part time after about 3 weeks but still taking a percocet at night time to sleep after about 6 weeks i need any further pain meds even at night i have hot flashes which i am learning to deal with but they are not fun i crave ice chips and chew on them constantly this is new since surgery i take ambien at night which allows me to sleep through the hot followed by cold flashes if i take the ambien i am awakened probly 15 times a night i know that ambien the best solution but it is helping me cope and i am grateful for the sleep i am taking tamoxifen i would like to switch to arimidex but i want to have joint bone pain for 5 years my emotions are a bit wacky i get cranky easily and i find myself tearing up at the craziest things i have lost about 5 pounds since the surgery in hindsight i am so glad this surgery is over emotionally it was a very difficult and scary surgery it was more difficult than my double mastectomy i truly felt like it was taking the last of my female identity lost my breasts my hair my uterus and my ovaries all in a 6 month period but i am adjusting and now i can move forward one last thing to remember if had alot of health challenges before surgery your recovery is going to take longer i had bmx chemo herceptin breast reconstruction hysterectomy oopherectomy and a severe medication reaction all within 6 months i think i am just now realizing that my body is just not going to bounce back like i think it should it takes baby steps and if you over do things you will pay for it lighthouse sorry you get a discount where is compassion so glad you made it through the first one i found that the first ac was the worst and subsequent infusions had fewer and side effects you need to ice during ac depending on your drug for the t portion of your regimen you may not have to worry i had paclitaxel and it cause much neuropathy i had a little bit of tingling but it was gone about a week after i finished chemo keep us posted on how doing lol love that susansgarden i be able to see a flight attendant coming down the isle now without smiling and thinking about that ok got my script today my onco is ok with me starting at lower doses if it helps me to gently start on this drug very glad about that she called it in as i sat there and made sure my pharmacy had the 10 mg tabs because she want me to have to halve and quarter the 20 mg tabs she mentioned starting at 5 but honestly i may start at mg not sure if it will make that much difference physically but mentally will help me my thing i really want to start until after my exchange surgery i had my last fill today so surgery is scheduled for 4th mar so two more months i just feel calm and ok to do the surgery and know that if i get anxiety and some of those other se from tamoxifen it might really mess with me as said i think a million times here sorry that i had awful reaction to zoloft in the past and i can tell you there would be no way of wanted to go under when i was going through what i was going through at that time so i have my reasons for this that may seem silly to others but are very real and valid for me she did say hmmm you had surgery on oct 4th and we still have you on anything yet i had onco score of 9 so no chemo for me almost like it was a little worrisome to her that i was unprotected still but then she said well if done chemo you of started it yet anyway so how imperitive is it i wonder to wait or not wait two more months with my early stage dx i saw her yesterday and went to ps today did not realize today would be last fill was supposed to have 3 more if known that of asked her if it would be ok to wait i figured another whole month would be too long i will probably call to ask her but what do all of you think hi everyoneit has been quite a while since i have posted i just had my 3rd of 4 chemo treatmets of cytoxan and taxotere and the neulesta shot the following day my experience through this has not been easy but as i saw someone else on here say i just show up in my first month of chemo i have gained 26 pounds and counting i had no idea as it was never mentioned to me that this could happen needless to say it has added to the depression i lost my breast and hair but did not know the weight would be added as well sighs not to metion i have been catapulted into menapause and was not warned of this either a day after my 2nd treatment i broke out in bright red rash looked more like a burn on my hand it then spread to my knucles and in between my fingers apparently this is from the taxotere i think the worst aside from weight gain has been the intense bone muscle pain it seems to be at its worst with this treatment ican only hope it gets better and that all of this has been for my best health interest anyone else having a similar experience if so how do you handle it all thanks for allowing me to ramble catori ladies like to keep this thread going if you mind we are all at different stages so hard to go to each month chemo started learned alot here many of the threads are about a c taxol taxotere etc i like having this resource for help encouragement sharing etc i just had my 4th treatment yesterday half way through the put the cytoxan in slower and gave me some antivan for later to take with the kytril much less headache slept great and certainly not as queasy as the last time i would not have thought to ask about the slower rate unless i read it on these boards my onc also told me that if my nausea gets really bad they will give a patch typically used for sea sickness does that i mean i get a cruise when this is all done thanks everyone for your sharing hi mand done 4 x ec and 8 out of 12 taxol and have had very bad red burning hand rash only thing that helped was keeping them in ice water now been diagnosed with erythromelalgia and am on gabapentin epilepsy medication for it the meds do not fully solve the situation so i still get a bad flare ups starting 3 days after t but they dampen the effect i also have numb finger tips and toes and am really sensitive to sunlight so get bad heat rash too last thing i need with the heatwave coming x zuwali chin up you can do this i believe okay to feel blue to cry to play the woe is me card as long as you can balance it out with the positive too not easy far from it but come a loooooong way and you will get through this i just got home from my first infusion and a cake walk compared to chemo no steroids pre meds or side effects really a nuisance more than anything but it works so take whatever they throw at me i needs rads too more than likely to prevent reoccurrencemiss bee you inspired me to get a pedicure before surgery i was loosely planning on doing so but you sealed the deal hope you are feeling better and stronger with each day to all my fellow hot flashers i wish i could make them stop they tapered off for a bit during round 5 and 6 but still make their presence known i have no idea if this is forever or not 43 44 on thursday and will be on tamoxifen eventually which will induce menopause correct pea sorry to hear about ramona my deepest condolences twinkle hooray for hair i think mine will begin to reappear soon to all so good to see so much humor here dealing with some serious shit and it just makes me happy to see that we can find some humor amidst the chemo haze and misery throwing a no mo chemo party and a ned party my new favorite term on thursday coincidentally also my birthday and wait to surround myself with friends and to thank them for all they have done for me i will be a blubbering mess while doing so but will be so happy to celebrate i shall toast you all too hello everyone sorry i have not posted in a while i drove my car from maine to maryland on tuesday 12 hours wow that was fun i made it though although i was pretty tired when i got here i am spending a few days with my dear daughter now that she is back from boot camp and ait she is full of stories i have been helping her set up her first appartment at college i will return to maine on sunday and then i start school on tuesday and then te exchange on thursday cannot wait ok hair hair is starting to grow i can see the outline of my darker hair from a distance but still can see my scalp i am lidless anyway in protest leg hair sadly coming back down there also coming backunderarm hair miaeyelashes upper still in tact but only 5 or 6 on lower lids toe hair never left menstral cycle also mia yea tamoxifen is going well i get dizzing once in a while and have a few hot flashes during the night but nothing that is not tolerable guess its been 2 weeks already so far so good congrats to everyone finishing chemo christine 47 i started on tac and yes the 3rd round sucked then there was the adriamycin shortage so my dr switched me to fec that was even worse i was soo sick after that he calculated that i had the same amount of ac as if i had chosen 4 ac plus 12 taxol he switched me to 6 more weeks of taxol which was so much easier to handle and my hair started growing back i finished treatment on 11 and just pray this is the end of it good luck to you wpmoon sorry you are here but a big welcome about the foot tingling taxotere deplates potassium bad carboplatin depletes magnesium bad so make sure you take plenty of both of those substances i take like times what a bottle says to take i have also been doing epsom salt baths for my feet some of the tingling could be swelling related i got that too in fact my feet are tingling in sympathy right now for you not sure if it is the same for you but in my case magnesium and potassium supplementation and the foot baths help i had a similar issue four years ago when i ate a low carb diet and i realized most of my foot issues were related to mineral depletion then the side benefit of lots of magnesium is i can poop if it gives me diarrhea it goes away quick since the body uses magnesium up quickly i am doing tch not p though i am also icing my feet during infusions and next treatment i am going to suck on ice chips i read on another forum that the chemo travels downward to your feet not sure if it is true but i figure foot detoxification hurt also rubbing my feet with aveeno stress relief lotion with lavender seems to help but not sure why it sure if it is the lotion or the action of rubbing my feet going to try some acupuncture next week and i will see if it helps and post my results i am using nutribiotic dental gel available on amazon or at health stores for my nasty mouth it tastes like i burnt my mouth on super hot coffee it is strong but it seems to be helping i have been 6 days and my taste buds came back yesterday so be warned if you get it that it might burn some but it is working for me i am also doing the baking soda and salt water mouth rinse too tsp each of baking soda and salt in a glass of lukewarm water garglina bunch every day the biotene mouth wash recommended tastes horrible totally gagged me i would love to hear other tips and tricks the wig i picked is called scene stealer by raquel welch i have long hair and i want to look as normal as possible it has a lace cap and the hair is hand sewn in so you can see your natural scalp through it i found a wonderful lady here who is in chemo for life colon cancer and she cut little wispiness around the hair line to make it look more natural hang in there i am so sorry you have to deal with breast cancer at such a young age my heart feels for you xoxo i don t agree with the way your onc is handling things either it is one thing to allow us to participate in these decisions it is another to hand off the entire decision to you your onc needs to be pressed to pick door number 1 2 or 3 that is his job not yours i was given two choices and was told the approximate chances of success behind door number one was xeloda with no hair loss but only 40 chance of working door number two was taxol avastin with hair loss but a 60 chance of working i asked my onc for her recommendation and she said taxol avastin i picked that option in some cases it can make a difference which chemo you use in what order maybe that is not true for you at this point but to me it is still a copout for an onc not to make a choice take care dear vavoom 10 i was diagnosed 5 yrs ago at age 44 with dcis as well as small amount of invasive cancer stage 1 had a mast on left side diep recon two yrs later i learned i am brca 2 and wish i had done a bilat mast have been ned for 5 yrs since surgery and have been on tamoxifen the whole time i hated tamoxifen worst side effect was complete destruction of my sexual response like a man with ed of all the issues around breast cancer this has been the worst one effecting my quality of life my marriage has taken a hit i was one month away from being done with tamoxifen when i went in for my 6 month check up with the onc my back was hurting and lost my appetite was losing weight blood test showed elevated tumor marker so the onc ordered bone scan this week learned that i have mets to the bone fortunately no lung or liver involvement but devastated by this news i am having a bone biopsy on monday which will determine treatment plans am still in a state of shock orchid penny your life sounds just like mine i have 2 kids in college a 14 yr old still home though been perimenopausal for about 3 years now on tamoxifen the last 2 years libido has been an ongoing problem for about 3 years and now this past year insomnia i briefly tried wellbutrin to help the libido but tolerate the palpitations it gave me so now using testosterone gel which does seem to help i get very achy for weeks at a time and then it all vanishes i alternate between vaginal dryness and constant discharge i always wonder is it the tamoxifen causing side effects or menopause progression gone 11 months now without a period but lab tests show that not in menopause it took me awhile to get used to the bone pain with tamoxifen i console myself with a tidbit i read not long ago i wish i had the study to cite it basically said the study showed that the more intense the bone pain the better the effectiveness of the tamox they say that it helps bone regeneration for those of us with osteoporosis that would make sense growing pains i have found that the pain has eased some with time you may also want to check the manufacturer of your tamox i take one by watson last month the pharmacy changed and gave me another one i forget which one anyway after 4 days i had to stop taking it i hurt had even worse insomnia and more cramping after doing a little research i found that certain are more common with each brand i found a pharmacy that has the watson brand and feel much better blessings hi welga not the one who works in a office but i did think about swapping services i have a cleaning business i now think long and hard about starting new drugs i try to research them but so often not enough information is offered wheni chose arimidex over tamoxifen it was because tamox comes with own set of side effects although been a terrific drug over the years it can also bring uterine cancer and cancer of the uterine muscle sometimes not diagnosed soon enough my onc wanted me to enter a study with tamox and progesterone to see if the combo would prohibit that side effect since i seem to be sensitive to weird side effects understand why i chose arimidex even though it was midway through trials i took that chance i did have dry mouth on it while on fos i had dry mouth and i also had trouble swallowing i know that nexium caused bone depletion i was never told this is the thing tell us when i first started seeing this dentist i told him what i had found about fos he know a few visits later he said he got literature that was sent to all dentists about the dental problems with fos and the like maybe if our medical teams would ask specific questions about the drugs everyone would know sooner and i went to a research clinic as far as chemo causing this why only some of us i had a pretty standard chemo my onc told me she had used it fifteen yearsearlier on a sicker patient who was still around i know other women who had chemo who going through this there has to be something else and by the way i heard today that they think they have a blood test to diagnose breast cancer too expensive right now but coming it just may cut down on mammograms and unneeded biopsies i had three fec treatments without too many issues other than hair loss bleeding gums and nose etc but the first of my t treatments docetaxel has all but finished me first i had aching of the muscles to the extent i walk 2 days after treatment so when that started to ease i thought good i can continue to work etc then my mouth blew up so sore eat or drink any hot liquids my tongue looked liked something from an scfi film and my feet and hands started to get hotter and hotter so sore i bend my fingers and i am constantly plunging feet and hands into cold water to try to ease the pain i already take b6 and tried e45 cream but not getting any better so combined with oral thrush urine infection and lost remainder of my eyebrows i was hanging on to them not sure i want the next two doses anymore advice i was on tamoxifen for 4 weeks after 2 weeks had severe abdominal pains with bad diarrhea stopped it for 5 days felt so much better then restarted on half the mg 2 weeks later the same thing it is now 3 weeks off of it and im still off and on with the diarrhea but not nearly as bad still get the urgencies and have to run went to the gi and she said it was the tamox and that sometimes it can do damage where it is not reversable i am now told lupron shots will do it and taking an ai im so nervous to start up on another type of drug i dont know that i will do it too much to handle no quality of life awful way to live there has to be another way hi everyone just got back from my 2 week vacation in florida i stay in direct sun and all seemed okay as far as that was sun for hair and chemo i have also noticed more shedding after chemo than during chemo i am 4 weeks since last chemo 2weeks since first herceptin alone i iced fingers and toes during chemo and still got neuropothy it got worse each time and is still bad i also got the bad taste back it usually lasted 2 to weeks and then went away and came back after the next chemo this time it stayed till 3 weeks after my verylast chemo and came back after 4weeks nurse said it will probably continue for a few more months until all poisons leave my body she said nueropothy will lessen in time its really annoying in my tingle and feel like pins and needles all the time sometimes stronger than others and sometimes a bit of numbness too my eyes also tear especially in the wind my nose runs i sound like a mess but really not everyone says i look are full of you know looks like a messy dry frizzy multi colored pile of crap when i wash it i try to style it with a soft brush loosly holding it under acool hair dryer it looks okay for about a day sometimes in the middle of the week i put organic conditioner on and cool blow dry it again it is very dry and that makes it more fly away and i think adds to the shedding because dry hair is more brittle i had lost 35 pounds before stating purpose not due to illness but gained 20 pounds back since thought it was because i ate anything i could stand because of the horrible tasteand that was mostly candy and mints chocolate ice cream ices and anything sweet well back to watching what i eat bad taste and all because i want this extra weight and i want to eat right for my overall health and well being i actually enjoyed eating right i really like too much sugar except for any form ice cream candy cake cookies etc my hair is actually much longer than normal which provesthat inot only go bald but that my hair grew during chemo i try to tell everyone i can about cold caps because eveyone cantell someone else and so on and so on we really are on a journey and this is our village you who have completed this journey before us have helped us on ours and we in turn will help the others who follow us as they say pay it forward twoof my friends called me to get info about the caps for friends of theirs who were recently diagnosed with bc and one with ovarian cancer so glad to be able to pass the info on by the way the 4 versus 6 tx is not for tch but for tc a different treatment i asked my onc about it and she said it is true but it is not tch to drim so glad to hear you are thru with herceptin congratulations and stay well thanks for asking about me to all of you who are finished with chemo or close to for you to all of you starting out keepa positive attitude and you will do well if you are doing the cold caps fear work you will keep your hair i have found it a very empowering experience we have no real control over what we are going thru and doing the caps us control something i also feel that when i look in the mirror and see myself with my hair on my head instead of a bald head i feel like a conquerer not a victim i also think others see us differently as well keep laughing keep positive nancy lif been using natural progesterone cream for about 6 months er pr so what the hell all that time been on arimidex and certainly not had hot sweats which i did get on tamoxifen told my surgeon though i bought the john r lee book on natural progesterone and he recommends it for osteoporosis as well great thread i know whether to laugh or cry at 66 and with an oh much much older it has been diy for years i do like the sound of that net catsuit though surfie hi everybody i just wanted to check in from the feb chemo thread to say i hope you all are dealing relatively well and that though it seems to take forever eventually you come to the other side of the chemo slog i finished up 4 dd of ac followed by the same of taxol a week ago and hard to comprehend that next monday is just a monday re used vitamin b6 and had good numbness but it tended to recede by the time the next treatment rolled around re nail problems i had them but it was actually from the cytoxan everything calmed down nailbed wise with the taxol just something to keep in mind those who are doing a dd taxane regimen watch out for the bone pain drink tons of water keep walking if you can rooting for you all wendy done both abraxane with avastin and navelbine with avastin no hair loss with navelbine had some problems initially with low white counts and having to get injections of neulasta but after changing infusion schedule the problems disappeared as to efficacy both worked for me if your onc is willing to give you a choice maybe you could try navelbine first and see how you respond you can always switch to abraxane i did not require with either drug nor did i have much nausea either so individual though hard to make these decisions good luck with whatever you decide hi em the numb fingers sound like the neuropathy you can get with the t confident it will pass cooling the hands helped me as for the picc removal it was sore getting the clip out but the tube came out no bother maybe ask for a local if you are able to good not to have it anymore ali xx i am 66 and have been on arimidex for 18 months i had pre existing mild arthritis in my knees and also in my shoulders for which i was am taking glucosamine and cod liver oil with occasional periods when it seems worse and my gp prescribes the anti inflammatory drug diflefenac since taking arimidex i have had a return of the orrible hot flushes and particularly some night sweats but these really do seem to have been reducing over the past 6 months my shoulder arthritis has worsened and just last week i have had one of my shoulders operated on surgical of the joint but i really do not think that arimidex has been the cause of my joint pain it is just the natural progression of the i have not had pains in my hands or feet or back as other people may have mentioned so i remain agnostic about the side effects of arimidex it costs 65 a month i understand and i believe it is the best option for bc my prognosis was not very good so i am grateful that this drug is available to me and is lenthgening my odds of living into a graceful and active so i guess that a definite recommendation good luck mary judy how is julia doing i think be strangling a doctor about now gotten good at it actually even my onco ducks when he tells me something he knows i like i do hope found a good outlet for your art you are quite talented i agree you

catch up i will oh and regarding that hairstyle i did tell you all that she was blind probably inhebriated and at least without clue you call this a style but post it in a sec hi ladies i promised to report some of the side effects from my first taxol i just had it last tuesday so am on day 4 today no allergic reaction to the drug dex benadryl and some other med really did a number on me in that i was so groggy and out of it during the actual treatment which lasted 3 hours but i was there for 6 in total including the long wait and seeing the doc etc ativan made me forget a lot of day 1 and day 2 as usual for me ativan does this i only took ativan cause i was anxious about the drug change prob wont bother with it for the last 3 rounds no nausea to speak of woohoo didnt even bother taking my emend on day 3 the 20 mg of dex and other drugs really didnt help with the constipation fun i was already having though really cranky in that respect the dex as usual has also made me super emo lots of tears lots of random pity parties other then that i noticed body aches started last night sore muscles back neck legs fingernails but the nails were sore for the last ac sore boobs too even deep in the reconstructed one i ache sore feet and twitches here and there my sciatic nerve has been shooting pain but i think thats from the pressure from being so bunged up although im really low energy and pretty much lay around like a sloth all day i do feel this is easier so far than the a c treatment knock on wood because the nausea is gone for me i still feel like tough to get up and do things cause im so sore this is the first time i got myself to the computer since tuesday i think that feeling so rotten and down makes it hard to feel motivated to do much though especially when feeling sad or just overwhelmed by it all i know you all know that feeling but we will get through it i hope for those who are startin taxol soon the nausea will be gone too feeling achy sucks but feeling nauseated and achy is no fun at all hope everyone has a low se weekend hugs to all well today i had taxotere i have found the side effects many and varied my worst has been constipation so am armed this time with a softener and a mover as well as more natural methods juices linseed etc my feet and hands have been dry and sensitve but not pins and needles have simply smothered them in body lotions every night good way to use up those birthday gifts that tend to sit around my side effects warranted spending money on special creams oh my nails are stripy but lifted though i cut them v short before this started and i echo the comments about oral health use a soft tooth brush i lose my taste for about a week use some form of mouthwash to avoid thrush and ulcers fatigue is definately cumulative if i do too much i get wiped out i buzz on the steroids which have been reduced to try and avoid the constipation i have treatment on tuesday and i now know to forget about planning anything for the friday monday following what else have kept my hair using the cold cap geraldine dimcecleland i think it might be from taxotere or in your case taxol i have same sores in nose i will try aquaphor i had bought some same on vision problems it bums me out makes it hard to read paper or see tv sure hope it is reversible definitely reporting it to my mo how many cycles are you planning on patty i am on abraxane which is taxol in its purest form i have the hurting feet and joints toe nail loss and my thumb seem to want to work anymore my onc strictly forbids me taking any supplement while on tx he said that anything that would help ease the s es would in theory lesson the effectiveness of the drug as well i was in cvs the other day and was so tempted to buy some but got scared and im on taxotere carboplatin herceptin taxotere will make her hair fall out it causes fatigue is she getting the neulasta shot the day after this shot can cause some bone pain and muscle cramps they watch closely when they start this drug because some people have had reactions to it i have not had to many problems with it i take tylenol for the bone pain you can get her some ensure or some thing like that for extra protein that helps you can get mouth sores also the alcohol free mouthwashes helps allot with that vitamins help also i am sure there will be others that have more advise i wish your gramma all the best let us know how she does you are both in my prayers take care kay jenc oh man that sucks i am on the weekly dose of 12 at number 5 today i have had only slight pain in my lower back nothing major so maybe switching is what you need to do i am getting bloody nose and my onc believe that the aches in my back or nose is related hello only 7 more to go yeah counting them down still gaining weight though tried zumba last week and will probably start that if i have enough energy take care everyone kelli hi poodeluvbug you mention how long this has been going on so i know if my situation will be like yours or not but for what worth like you i had regular periods until chemo and then wham menopause or i guess we call it chemopause hot flashes were very bad for the first months maybe 6 8 months waking me up just like yours ocassionally had them during the day too but those were eaier to ignore i finished chemo then had a break ha ha with bmx and then radiation had hot flashes through them as well but was either getting used to them or they were lessening anyway i started tamoxifen two weeks ago two weeks after rads were over so far i noticed any new side effects with the tamoxifen from the beginning my onc said the best ideas to reduce hot flashes were exercise limiting alcohol and limiting caffeine i am off caffeine now and drink very seldom more during rads try to get exercise but still am rather fatigued after all the above i have a girlfriend who has tried the chinese approach with herbs and accupuncture but she has not had great success wish there were a magic cure i do think they have gotten less since they started nine months ago now i wake up about 2 3 times per night and that is a big improvement i hope time might help you as well good luck hope i agree with everyone go anywhere ok caps gone big smile do not feel guilty be proud of how far you have come in your treatment and we are happy and cheering that you are moving to the next phase of treatment we want to continue to hear from everyone so hope please stay with us and others bippy agree with you the women on this board are my peeps this is my home and we have built a bond we started this together and we have shared so much about our journey milestones with our families the nutcracker birthdays visiting daughter from college becoming virtual honoray aunties and most of all we have just been there for each other i will be here through chemo radiation and even during the healing process some groups plan getaways etc may be we will get there some day glad to read the experience on the ivs tomorrow will be my 3rd tx via iv so far so good in terms of finding veins but the track marks i go in for 2 taxol tomorrow my mom accompanies me to each of my chemo treatments and i love her for it and her company she then spends the day with me and often comes back up on the weekend during those down days even at my age i am a girl round 1 impact i slept a lot i was able to work but when i get home i force myself to eat and then slept yesterday i went to sleep pm woke up at pm and was back in bed by pm and wake up until this morning around am for me taxol fatigue seems to make me sleep more instead of just feeling tired the good thing i have chemo brain so i can at least think and no nausea i still have a lot of achiness which i take tylenol for bad news the taxol is interfering with my wafarin dosage which they need to find a new dosage that works today my inr was high where they need to take me off for 3 days to drive the down into the therapeutic range of it is now nothing has changed in my diet or medicine so they are pointing to the chemo as the culpurit with taxol i still taste but the really odd thing i am forgetting to eat like i am just not hunger anyone else have this experience nurseshark thinking of you as you near your induction date we wait to see pictures and step into our honorary auntie roles hope all are doing well or managing hugs always angie omg in the same boat but with taxotere after my bilateral mastectomy it was 4 weeks that i started my first dose and it was awful i lost all energy completely and sadly i ended up in the er because i came down with a fever and a throat infection now stuck here and they want to bring up my white blood count today they poked me 3 times and they find no good vein im struggling to fight the infection and now gave me those neopogen shots to build up the white blood cells and that also has its own side effects why would i want 3 more rounds of chemo surgery is done pathologist report came back with no more cancer cells so why push my body i started tamoxifen in may i had a period since i startedchemo in april and hopeit stays that way my three complaints are 1 fatigue tamoxifen or recovery from chemo i just have the stamina i used to have 2 hot flashes mostly in the middle of the night i need a fan blowing on me and just cover up when the hot flash passes 3 bone pain i feel 20 years older than my 50 years mostly in my hips when i get up in the morning or stand up after sitting awhile my onc wants me to exercise 30 minutes most days but between the fatigue and the bone pain lucky to get in 15 minutes of good exercise walking or biking supposed to be on tamoxifen for 2 or 3 years then switch me to an ai i recently had a bone density done after 2 years no significant change my onc lied to the government here to get me 4 zometa infusions you have to have osteoporosis normally i also take calcium with d3 in it and d3 by itself looks like the zometa and calcium helped ashla i remember having really strange nipple pain a few months after rads sharp stinging pain it finally went away i finished my first round of 3 navalbine infusions i found that i had some nausea and maybe a bit more tired but that could just be cumulative effect after 12x taxol otherwise it is fine i am just taking each day as it comes for the most part i have been riding and working part time so that keeps me upbeat glad things are going well for you all q after a year on arimidex i had horrific trigger finger middle finger and trigger thumb on my right hand every morning the pain was awful and i kept dropping things because they locked so hard my hand looked like a claw one doc mentioned surgery but there was no way i was going to get a permanent procedure for a temporary side effect caused by a drug i was taking i quit the arimidex and in 8 weeks all my ses i had a huge long list went away then i started femara the trigger thumb never came back but the middle finger did at first i used a foam tube usually used on toes that you cut to size i kept it finger length and on top of that i wrapped one of those metal splints lined with foam my finger was totally immobilized that help either i stopped the femara a month ago i still have mild trigger finger and i treat it in much the same way that special k does except that i rub the entire finger with aspercreme for the pain wrap some stretchy gauze around it then secure the gauze with paper first aid tape stiff enough to keep the finger from bending all the way but loose enough to still have a bit of movement that has helped with the pain more than anything if i still have the trigger finger in a month consider the cortisone shots since off the ais completely this is a huge question for me right now i flunked tamoxifen after two months on it became extremely weak had to use a alarming i finished five years of arimedex in april of this year dryness of just about everything very little joint aches maybe some tiredness but i be sure because i was always on them since bc treatment so maybe just weaker than i was but othewise no particular problems then in april my onc started me on femara and i was glad for the added protection but gradually been losing energy since april along with a lot of my hair so friday night i decided i needed a break maybe a couple of weeks just to see if my energy improves call my onc monday morning and tell him and see what he says but i just get fed up sometimes wondering how much of my energy outlook is from the drugs and how much is the real me wish i could just go on with the arimidex it was easier by the way he seems to feel that seven years has some significance too rather than five though there any study results yet still in touch with the anecdotal evidence which is all we have so i do trust him on that we shall see binney i would really like to know what to do too 11 days out from my first taxol and still experiencing bone pain in my hips knees and ankles taking advil and helping some but i thought the bone pain would be over after 3 4 days i sailed through ac too worked almost full time and continued on with life as usual now having a hard time getting out of bed i have just finished 12 x weekly taxol and have had one dose of a c and neulesta shot the taxol was much easier for me numbness in the fingers toes was the worse with taxol my advice for a c is to drink loads of water prior and after treatment munch on ice chips when they are giving you the a it helps to keep the mouth sores away try and get a prescription for emend anti nausea it really is the best out there but it is expensive if you do not have insurance i have not had alot of nausea with a c my appitite is very low and i am super tired all the time my iron levels are low so i am trying to eat stuff that is high in iron the neulesta shot i would suggest taking one claritin the day before chemo for at least 4 days it seems to help with the bone pain that you get with the shot i checked with my onc and he said it was ok i opted to have my shot in the stomach it was not uncomfortable as it is suppose to be less painful than the arm my hair started falling out on a c around days i managed to keep quite a bit of hair on taxol it just thinned out alot i wish you all the best of luck with your chemo i know it is not easy but it is doable mandy my sister has had xeloda for 2 14 day treatments taken with ixempra and did great the first two times but her 3rd xeloda rx she has developed the hand syndrome feet are still ok but she has developed vomiting and diarrhea which we tried compazine and today switched to zofran for 2 doses but take it because it improve the vomiting and she had side effects from zofran so we held pm dose of xeloda to let her stomach rest and see onc tomorrow this seems to be is a wonderful chemo so we hope they will stop the meds for a couple day let her stomach settle down and then lower the dose and try to restart i wanted to post and suggest that when you apply the lotions on you hand and feet rub your hands just blot it on heavy and use cotton ball or something else to rub it in by the 3rd xeloda she took for 8 days of the 14 days so far her skin on her handspeeled off in thick layers and cracked in placesand they look like they are scaled or badly burn so maybe if we would have been more careful and known not to have her rub her hands it have gotten so bad good news is we started using bag balm which has like vaseline and lanolin in it her hands are improving and we had her use cold compresses and elevate her hands which seemed to help alot info says that the xeloda leaks out the capillaries in your hands and feet and by rubbing and creating friction it releases more chemo and damages the tissues which causes the side effect so follow the suggestions that are listed on the xeloda website from drug companies try cold compresses keep them elevated try not to rub them at night she put vaseline or bad balm really thick on her hands please let this make you afraid of the xeloda she has done great on it until now and her she has a 11 cm liver mets which complicates her treatment we also have her drinking 32 oz of gatorade a day and 2 16 oz bottles of water she completed 4 ixempra infusions and this is her 3rd xeloda set of 14 days so she had done really well so far she was dx in august with stage iv bc mets to liver lungs sternum and started taxol and avistan in sept for 3 months and it help so we really need ixempra and xeloda to work its magic so best of wishes read the drug info and follow the tips we hope the suggestions may help god bless diane taxotere was responsible for my neuropathy hands and feet outer three toes on each foot are still affected and it took 10 months after my last infusion for my hands to come the point that i could hold a dental instrument i hope the stuff is kinder to you lisa hi chipper sorry to see that still having a lot of angst over this all about perspective really personally i feel 5 benefit is most definitely worth it because an additional 5 on top of all the other treatment the other point you originally made was about slipping naturally into menopause it seems from what said although may have it wrong that the menopause is your big fear and the destabilising effect if may have and not the tamoxifan itself i know some people who have had a really hard with a natural menopuase and i know of someone who had no problems after a and sudden menopause weight gain can be a problem with a natural menopause as well is it a case of prolonging the inevitable menopause rather than thinking about the potential benefits to you of tamoxifan i can see where coming from with all this i like as much certainty in my life as possible and this wretched illness robs you of that how would you feel about having some therapy before making a final decision or whilst starting tamoxifan to help with the ocd side of things hope you can reach a more peaceful feeling about all of this soon take care elinda x hi there i started tamoxifen in sept i believe just like sweetbean i had some hot flashes and a little joint pain at first had a couple other little weird symptoms but nothing that was too difficult and they went away after just a couple of weeks honestly for me been no big deal sometimes i wish i had a little more in the se department so i wouldfeel like for sure working i gladly take it every single day and am thrilled to have it as an option ithink of it as my pill i think i read that glucosaminecan be acounter totamoxifen so sweetbean ask your doc to be sure take this for 5 years and then likely an ai for 5 years best wishes to you all had been taking xeloda first ct showed regression last ct showed liver spots and hilar lymph nodes no longer visible oh so close to ned but had two new mesenteric lymph nodes show up as probable mets onc and i are wondering if the two new nodes were due to fever flu i was just getting over so holding on the happy dance for nowtaking a break from xeloda due to issues and neuropathy skin on the soles of my feet turned blotchy brown they looked dirty even though clean then skin started to peel off due to the hfs and neuropathy burning feeling in my feet and pain from walking had decreased my xeloda dose to 1000mg twice a day onc is concerned the dose is too low anyway i am enjoying the break very much have been having nausea and some vomitting and a little diarrhea after stopping the xeloda nausea started my off week just before the chemo break dr thinks it may be due to xeloda still in my system luckily compazine is taking care of the nauseacurrently trying aromasin while on my chemo break one month break then rescan and go from there had no luck with femara before getting the impression from what read that usually work too well if pr onc did say that as aromasin is a steroid and thus structurally different from femara that it does sometimes work when the had bad joint pain and many other se while on femara none so far with aromasin expecting to probably have to go to iv chemo after my break most likely low dose weekly paclitaxol but hoping i am wrong ned would be awesome but if not am hoping i can be approved for abraxane as the se seem much milder onc says you can do much larger doses as a resultfunny thing last ct scan pretty sure my boyfriend was way more nervous than i was for once i felt as if i could handle good news or bad news and i got both ha hoping my scanxiety has disappeard for good along with those anarchistic mutant demon cancer cells quote i was told that diarrea can also be a problem maybe that is because i will be on taxatere and xeloda at the same time mine starts on thursday really nervous about the hand foot stuff my onc said to try b 6 when i start this about 150 mg a day he said about 30 of his patients said it helped so it is worth a try as i type all day and also have to walk up a flight of stairs to my office anyone else have suggestions or experiences hi sherry interesting that you mention diarrea as had alternating bouts of constipation and diarrea since my 3rd chemo my doctor is recommending that i put my fingertips in ice water during taxotere treatments although i think for saving the fingernails rather than for neuropathy if i learn anything else let you know take care jane with you all on the weight gain rather adds insult to injury i also feel like my face has aged significantly in 6 months heading in to work today for a visit and agreed to a very short term assignment which is due wednesday we will see how that goes and whether my brain still works started tamoxifen on sunday has anyone else recently started been on zolodex injections since january so i expected a big change in hot flashes and joint pain but i was wrong hot flashes way more intense like my head is going to burn up and explode already on an antidepressant gabapentin and magnesium and acupuncture so i think there is much more to do but hope my body adapts the real bad se in the crankiness i am a fairly calm person but i have really taken a few heads off this week for no reason i read called tam rage hope that calms down anyone else experience that guess i better stop procrastinating try to find something in my closet that fits draw on some eyebrows and head into work happy friday aelkcolb 7 what you are describing is neuropathy it is a side effect of taxol i did experience that during my taxol treatments and for a solid 6 weeks afterwards mine has slowly diminished but i still feel it weakly i have only been on arimidex for 2 weeks i do not remember reading that is a side effect but someone else will reply no doubt no need to apologize for asking we all are learning how to get through this nasty disease peggy hope you get an appt quickly sounds scary but the good thing is you just started arimidex maybe one of the others is not as hard on the valves i agree with you about being so weak during chemo still in shock how hard that was on my body mind hi had 4 lots of zometa for early bone mets and osteoporosisc had flu like symptoms after 1st one but not since drank water during drip what i am finding is that the next day i get bad heartburn acid reflux and end up coughing to shift it this then subsides and 2 weeks later it starts again and then once more just before next infusion much more sensitive to some foods but not narrowed down enough to exactly which ones was put on the zometa as the chemo gave me mild heartburn and onc said tablets were more likely to make it worse so on the iv as long as it works and my crap veins can stand it anyone any ideas about the heartburn acid reflux gullet irritation will ask chemo nurses next time i go as always helpful and full of good ideas liz x starting dose dense ac t this wednesday nervous i got my port on friday and it is so sore and painful they said i could have the port placed and start chemo the same day i imagine that the way it has felt all weekend really strange though since the placement surgery i have had so much energy i have felt better besides the pain at incision sites than i have in 2 months i cleaned all over the house like i had adhd then went shopping to stock up on essentials for the upcoming months of treatment my friend says i am nesting i still need to go wig and scarf shopping during my class i asked about icing fingers and toes because i am so phobic of losing my toenails they said that with ac and taxol i should not lose my nails but that we would ice during the taxol weeks to help with neuropathy is that true about ac not causing nail loss i would just as well do the icing anyway just in case because i am so scared of losing the tootsie nails any experience with that anyone btw i am still on my pain meds from the port placement which my coworkers are saying make me random talkative and loopy hello ladies i thought of stopping by to give you some courage and virtual hugs last year i was exactly where you are now also i thought of writing an account of the most important things i learned during chemo burned mouth syndrome got it at the second treatment it felt like my whole mouth was burned the edges of my mouth were red and very sensitive and i had no sense of taste for abotu 2 weeks during this treatment i had only drank ice water next treatment i started chewing on ice chips still got the burned mouth but less severe the last treatment my boyfriend went to get some lunch and i said what the heck in for another 2 weeks of not tasting anything bring me some french fries please he brought them and i started eating them as they were starting the taxotere result no burned mouth anyway what i did do soothe it half and half hydrogene peroxide followed by biotene mouthwas the one for dry mouth also the magic pink mix get maalox and liquid benadryl and mix them in equal quantities you have to buy the brand names store generic is just fine it helps a lot frozen sorbet and frozen fruit lollipops helped a lot too taxotere adverse reaction i had that in my first two treatments no matter how much steroid they would push in a very scary reaction you feel all hot your chest tightens and hurts your blood pressure and heart rate rise your oxygen levels get low make sure you notify the nurses rightaway you should have a little bell of some sorts near your chair at the third treatment they just started the drip very slowly and pushed it higher from there no more reactions i got frozen peas with me and as they started the taxotere i got my fingers and toes in them i lose any my hair started falling in the 12th day i lost all body hair except for my eyebrows they only got thinner and the but it grows nicely afterwards i took lots of biotin look at my avatar and you can see how my hair is 9 months after the last treatment i hope this helps someone on this list and again courage this too shall pass big hugs for allday wow glofriends all been busy reading and writing today debbie i was going to send you a woohoo message for your last tx to learn have to wait one more still all good 2 left joanne what is i know that tamoxifen causes all those menopausal side effects and not anxious to do that all over again so i think try the it makes the joint pain too flashes will be back on the table i guess layne you just gave me a bit of hope i just assumed that my knee and shoulder aches are from bone loss but discovering that your bone scan indicates high bone value and you still have me my situation since been on fosamax to prevent bone loss sleep number bed huh and more calcium i never would have made it through all this without you and i so appreciate each and every one of you and hope have a happy thanksgiving brenda amazon after my taxol t on monday i had really bad bone pain hit me on tuesday night through wednesday i was like you slept one hour at a time and i felt like crap on wednesday all day i still feel achy in places but not enough to keep me down i did stay in bed all wednesday and i think it really helped so yiku should give in to it stay in bed drink tons of fluid and let your family take care of you good morning leah i had a cm tumor and my scar is less than 2 inches probably more like inches guessing it depends on the location of the tumor how easy it is to access my tumor was so close to the outer edge that the bs could easily find it without wires etc twink i know from your website that you have taxotere 2 on thursday how did your meeting with the ps go please check in we miss you alyson nice to hear from you glad that you are listening to your body to take it easy when you can i hope that you find taxol easier than fec it think that if it for the crushing fatigue probably exaggerated because of anemia taxol would be a breeze compared to ac sammiekay next week will be taxol woo woo catherine we have much in common as my dh is also a physics professor tracy and all you other lurkers you have to put it a long post or even read the older posts but do check in to sigh hi every once in a while hugs to marsha and wendy for bar trip monday phy accounted for jen tuesday hillary catherine sammiekay all accounted for wednesday marsha wendy thursday stephj 1st taxol piper 1st taxol terry pat twink kim hillary dd taxol my pain was all on the a c it has improved dramatically we are not doing neulasta with the tax and i already feel a difference i had the neulasta after each a c and the bone pain literally started on day 2 or 3 and never went away until it was time for the next round three weeks out of my system and boom no more back pain just muscle tension in my shoulders that goes away with otc meds i start pt and bc yoga this week and i hope both will help hi i love chocolate i am also a fareston girl i am also a poor metabolizer for tamoxifen also found out after doing the cyp 2d6 test i have been in chemopause since the middle of my chemo treatments which ended in sept the last time i saw the onc he did do another round of blood work and according to this round he can tell i am still not truly in menopause so the ovaries are still kind of sputtering i guess i have really had no problem with it i did start off with hot flashes and still have them but they are not too bad i also have had a little bit of fluid retention it is difficult to know if this is from the drug or if i am still kind of trying to lose some of the steroid water weight i think his plan is to continue with fareston for another year or so then switch once i am really menopausal to the next round of drugs i have had no depression or bone pain at all i have been really pleased and hoping when we switch the next round will be the same good luck to you hope you willfind very few if any se with fareston kim hi i had my last period about 18 months ago and was diagnosed with bc in may this year i started tamoxifen about 3 months ago and been having cycles of dragging like period pains but no bleeding then they seem to ease almost like having periods still without the bleeding i went to have an ultra sound this week and the radiographer said i had thickening of my endometrium being a nurse i went straight on the internet and researched what this can mean and wish i it is associated with tamoxifen and i thought that after 3 months there be changes am i wrong or is this a problem that may have been there already got 5 years on the tamoxifen and i really want to put myself at risk of endometrial cancer anyone experienced any of this anna 47 i have the same exact rash on my head mine started day 11 after tx 2 i also put hydrocortisone cream on my head to stop the itching does anyone have any better suggestions 40somethingmom i am so happy for you it must feel like a milestone finishing this stuff are you going on tamoxifen now that you are done with chemo kathyl how many treatments do you get of herceptin

weeks some se better fatigue is not one of them i just wake up everyday and do what i can my fmla was up the end of march after 18 years i had to resign i have surgery and reconstruction coming up i wish you strength and confidence to go back i had herceptin only infusion yesterday the se is joint pain and body aches i took a pain pill it helped i also saw my plastic surgeon what a nice young man age 34 very personable and thoughtful i am confident about his abilities he actually gave me his cell phone on a card and said call or text me anytime he is going out of town end of april so my surgery will be first of may i think i am going to stay off the tissue expander thread the stories are scaring me long months of pain ugg jstacy how is your ear infection i hope you got it checked if i missed post i am sorry bed time love and hugs to all pmr 53 laurais i am 6 months pfc still on herceptin and was just switched to arimedex started yesterday was on tamoxifen for 4 months i have i now have a pretty full head of short hair shorter on top let you know how it goes with ai side effects does state hair thinning vivian hisecond taxol yesterday i am feeling fine today went to work now its evening i am a bit tired no nausea or tingles i am taking the l acetal carnitine 3000 mg a day and i think it is eliminating all neuropathy my fingers are fine my onc said to take glucosimine and condroitin for the joint pain i am expecting the joint pain any day now i did the tch combo adriamycin alone can damage the heart and it is thought that this chemo with herceptin could be a double whammy so to speak yes there is a slightly higher success rate with adriamycin the risk of developing a later leukemia is also higher with adriamycin though carboplatin is also the type that can cause leukemia i actually know this at the time i feel like i am going crazy i am convinced the cancer is back in my bones or in my brain or in my liver or in all of the above logically i know not likely since i was stage 1 no lymph nodes low oncotype score logically i know just being anxious and paranoid but i have the wherewithal to listen to logic right now and these worries are consuming me and eating up every ounce of my mental and physical energy it help that the tamoxifen is contributing to my crazy i do not handle tamoxifen severely affects my i know that the tamoxifen is probably a big player in putting me into the mental state and oh what a fine state it is that in right now i worry that a malingerer that when i see my mo next week and ask her for some scans for peace of mind that i am pulling energy and resources from those that really need it but what if one of those who needs it i have lots of niggly symptoms but nothing i think that screams this is metastases i think the worrying all started when i found out a week and a half ago that my osteoporosis is worse than i thought a spine xray showed demineralization kyphosis and also confirmed a suspected t12 fracture immediately my crazy brain started wondering if mets could somehow lead to osteoporosis since all the bloodwork my endocrinologist has ordered to date has not found an underlying cause for such an advanced case of osteoporosis at age 33 and now i worry that every symptom is somehow mets so going to share my symptoms please tell me honestly is this just anxiety or is there enough here that i should ask for scans imaging if nothing else i feel like i need the additional imaging for peace of mind because i really think i will go off the deep end if i keep living in this state of wondering and what if i like who become with all this worrying i feel a horrible wife and mother right now this is driving me crazy anyways symptoms are i have been having headaches that keep showing up in the same spot on the right side of my head had a few flashes of light had a few instances of what i think is called phantom odors where i smell something that i know is not there like very strongly smelling cinnamon raisin bread while driving on the freeway miles away from any sort of business or civilization i have a hard time thinking of words and also struggle to get words out sometimes i struggle with this when sleep deprived but way worse than usual i struggle to remember what doing when in the middle of doing it like if on my way to do a simple task i forget what on my way to do literally 10 seconds later this happens probably a dozen or more times over the course of a day i have become extremely angry and irritable but i think that is the tamoxifen had intermittent nausea for the past month that i was beginning to think might be but now it seems to not be related to my gluten consumption based on when i feel it i did get some bloodwork done this morning to check for gluten intolerance and will find out later this week yesterday afternoon a sharp pain started on my upper right abdomen that has continued constantly into today but now i only feel it when i breath in deeply and this morning i started getting sharp chest pains also on the right than the abdominal pains but more intermittent had chills and fevers 5 which is a fever for me since my normal is a solid on and off for about two months and my energy is so so very low sometimes i feel like my energy is so low and simultaneously that everything in life is demanding all my energy and focus that i seriously wonder if my body might forget to breathe under the weight of all the other pressing demands i know it sounds crazy and this is probably the anxiety and depression but it is tearing me apart the low energy is probably also from my low iron recent bloodwork showed i am severely iron deficient i just started taking a good iron supplement so hopefully that helps on the energy front so should i be concerned or is this all anxiety i cannot think straight anymore to sort any of this out hi there sisters sorry i got back to you all sooner i hope everyone had a good thanksgiving my last chemo treatment nov 19 and of course it kick my butt for about a week but it is all done my fingernails are funky so i asked my ono she said that they might fall off within the next 2 monhth and it was from the chemo drug taxotere some are blue at the base of the nail if they come off and cancer is gone i am fine with that now which was today i started the drug tamoxifen like some of you all i willl let you know what se i have which i hope none i get my port out friday yea i am glad cause i have never got use to it i have since i had my surgery aug 4th i had 500 cc so far my ps stopped when i started chemo because the risk of infection so i get my next fill on dec 28 which is 100 cc each fill and they are painful for about days hugswanda hope i sailed through chemo no issues with ac except for hair loss and then moved to weekly taxol i iced my hands and feet stuck them in a cooler bag with frozen peas and took no neuropathy issues my doc give me neulasta or neupogen shots though so the weekly taxol tanked my blood cell counts and i felt way more fatigued than i ever did on ac and i was doing ac while pregnant ended up with a neutropenic fever by taxol 8 but even then i feel bad just really tired after that incident my doc put me on neulasta and i was good i was told there was a correlation between how you feel with chemo and if you had morning sickness while pregnant i never had morning sickness between both pregnancies so maybe that is true rangermom i had neoadjuvant chemo before surgery because i had a large tumor that had spread to the lymph nodes it worked very well for me after a few weeks i had a mri that was clear i know it work as well for everyone but more aggressive types like triple negative and her 2 often respond well to chemo i had 4 cycles of dd ac and then 12 taxols paminwv i also got through without a lot of side effects towards the end of my ac treatments i had some anemia and fatigue but that improved pretty quickly once i started taxol this is a great thread chemo always a horrible experience my onc told me one of her patients trained for a marathon during chemo i recommend that though hi junies has anyone else felt worse with taxol than ac if i remember correctly i had about 3 good days each ac cycle but with the taxol not having any days that call good maybe because i went back to work and have more reason to be tired or because the treatments are catching up with me i dunno i just know tired of feeling yucky today i went to the dermatologist to have my head examined har har and he said the little red spots on my scalp were normal however he found 3 precancerous on my arms and froze them off he also told me to put lamasil on my oozing toenail all together now eewwww to prevent a yeast infection until the nail comes off just thought mention that in case anyone else is having the same problem the oncologist is going to consider dropping my last taxol if the neuropathy gets any more pronounced but counting my blessings some of you ladies have been through far worse especially those of you with additional surgeries i think about you guys all the time i want to plant tulip bulbs for my victory garden and i found some on they are called darwin hybrid ollioules soft pink with dark pink stripes i want to try and force them indoors during the winter as well since i never got around to doing a garden this summer and now i feel like i missed out hey i have been on my chemo now for 2 weeks taxol avastin and then taxol last week tomorrow i do the taxol avastin again i had terrible aches pains after the first infusion but not sure if from a nasty virus i had otherwise i am doing extremely well so far no ses to speak of good energy level hair is still there just some blood in my nose but nothing major so when should i expect the ses to start hair loss hoping not getting a false sense of security anyway just thought give an update i figured my good qol was coming to an end but very happy so far that been able to continue be bopping along hugs to all cat genie i take popsicles but my chemo nurses did offer small cans of fruit juice with a cup of crushed ice each time i think they were doing that to prevent mouth was just one of the few perks they had to offer in the infusion center where i was being treated nevertheless i always made sure i had a cup of crushed ice to suck on during each infusion it a real experiment so i have no idea if it helped the taxotere caused my mouth to be very sore and my tongue was swollen 3 to 6 days after each treatment despite the crushed ice but i never got any actual sores in my mouth i was careful to brush my teeth at least 3 times a day with an toothbrush and mild toothpaste and i rinsed several times a day with a salt soda water solution during the phase i suspect those helped more than crunching on a few pieces of crushed ice keep in mind that the chemo drugs are circulating in your body for one or two days after the infusion so whatever you do for a few hours during the infusion might not be enough to really thanks everybody for the info juneaubugg if you dont mine me asking what chemo are you on are you taking tamoxifen now or does that start later is anybody having chemo brain today my head is killing me and now im nauseous this should be my good week as im doing my next chemo wednesday i feel rough today and to top it off my grandbaby almost 3 yrs old and she is my adopted daughter now told her daycare teacher today that her mimi me was gonna die now where the hell did she hear that who said i was dying im so p ed that she has heard something that makes her think that and i feel awful that she thinks that im not sure she even understands what dying is how do you deal with that don 23i have seen posts from many who have gone off the a for a month i went off of it myself for a month due to depression but found that i feel any differently aches and pains may be different the original onc i went to hear of stopping the a or even switching to tamoxifen it was finally my pcp who told me to stop it i have a new onc now hi lisa i am not taking neulasta the bone pain is from the taxol my onc prescribed me percocet for the pain it helps but doesnt take all the pain away i hate when it is about to wear off then the pain rears its ugly head i should be starting rads in january so i will be reading your posts lisa about rads zsterling i began using the minoxidil about 20 years ago i have the male balding gene too as i have a bald brother and one of my sons is bald when the generic became available i started using it the cost is for a month so considerably cheaper it took about 4 months for me to see any benefit years ago when i first started fast forward to my diagnosis within 3 to 4 months on tamoxifen i started losing an incredible amount of hair even though i was still using the minoxidil i would say it took 6 to 8 months to see new hair growing i used scarves to hide the loss not the silky kind but the non slippery materials in the store i bought long oblong ones and wound it around my head twice before i tied it in the back that way i could kind of spread out the scarf to cover more of the thin areas on the top on my head so now my hair is growing in but ever so slow i color my hair so it is easy to see that in 4 weeks the back and sides have considerable gray at the roots but the top well each month the top grows maybe of an inch i have two years and one more month to go before i am done with the tamoxifen and i am hoping it will grow the same rate as the rest of my hair when i am off this medication at least the extreme hair loss stopped i hope you find something that works for you justme same week for scans we can wait together my taste buds are bad too but unfortunately it kept me from eating too much probably the steroids doing that to me what kind of surgery are you doing i will be doing bmx after my chemo as long as my scans are good beaglesgirl you are doing weekly taxol right have you found they have gotten worse with each treatment mine abraxane was pretty easy until number 5 and now i just had number 6 and i feel sore all over and the tingly fingers and feet i need to buy more it was really helping and now i ran out sorry about your vision is that because of the taxol my visionwas fuzzy when i was on the ac but seems to have gotton better once i finished i have more aches and pains so you probably know where my mind goes but i am trying to convince myself it is just the when i did taxol 8 years ago i believe how sore it made my whole body that is why i asked my doc if we could do abraxane instead of taxol this time abraxane has been much easier i must admit rhgsr and kimmie good luck with new round of chemo all the other ladies started taxol i am glad to hear most of you feel easier than ac finished 4th ac last thursday my tongue still feel burnt nausea is getting better and i am so relived this is the last round of ac i am starting taxol on weekly for 12 weeks got my premed last week for taxol the nurse told me to take 20 mg of steroid the night before then another 20 mg 2 hours before chemo it scares me to take this much of decadron for taxol it seems to be quite extreme and a lot higher dose than ac is it normal for everybody getting taxol thanks hello widgie anne and welcome been on tamoxifen for just over a year now initially i had 2 lots of generics aps then cp and then my pharmacist suggested i try nolvadex most of the ses disappeared leaving a bit of joint stiffness some night sweats but only mild daytime flushes and tiredness now back on generics last weeks as no long make nolvadex in the uk back to headaches and increased joint stiffness and hot flushes as well as leg cramps which i have before but live in hope that they may settle down i got aps again this time and not sure whether to aim to get it again and see if i settle down with it or to try to get the other brand none of my ses are horrific just rather tedious especially as i thought i was doing so well with the nolvadex always taken mine in the morning but my onc said that if i was finding the hot flushes during the day were getting a bit much i might want to try taking it at night eliza xx thanks for the compliment anne but the avatar was bc i went shopping yesterday needed some larger blouses to get thru the herceptin balloon i had on a scarf instead of my itchy wig and was talking to the sales clerk about finishing chemo and hair stuff she looked at my license and with a sad face said oh you had such nice long hair lol i had lots of help with it a great hairdresser who is also a dear friend so be contacting debbie soon for more help good luck with the final taxols and hopefully the runny nose stops with them for you take care karen titan laura i set up the sept rads thread today i think i might straddle both threads for a while but will end up on the sept thread most of the aug rad group seems to be mid way or wrapping up while just beginning i know you two and others are moving to this next step chemo down rads to go laura my port removal is scheduled for tues the day after you get out i can hardly wait really been bugging me lately tonya and geri hang in there we have all been there and can completely relate to how you are feeling you can and will make it tonya you might ask your onc for some sleeping pills they really helped me my onc said my sleep patterns might be upset for more than a month or two after chemo i am 4 wks out from taxol and it has improved also for neuropathy i started using powder dietary supplement and it really helped still using it for the occasional limp foot i just had my 6 month check up with oncologist and she said i could stop taking the arimidex that it was up to me i am so afraid to stop aches pains carpal tunnel etc have plaqued me over these few years along with weight gain i would love to stop but mentally i am scared she left it up to me i hate that i wanted her to make the decision for me do you ladies understand so i told her i would take a vacation for about a month and if there is any change in the way i feel i would permanently stop btw i started tamoxifen and went to arimidex a year later she said being on hormonal therapyfor the 5 years was good what to do thought stop by to catch up and say hello and really glad i did been spending less time on this board and most of that has been on the may thread i still think about this group though i had my last taxotere august 21 which puts me a bit behind most of the women here which means your posts are giving me some idea of what to expect thank you another one whose skin never looked as good as it did during chemo funny an essay by barbara ehrenreichthat appeared in back in 2001 definitely worth googling if you read it in which she mocks that idea how weird that so many of us seem to have experienced exfoliation as a beneficial chemo se and am hoping it stays as soft and clear as been if it oh well just be happy to have eyebrows again drawing them in is the worst part of my morning routine these days thank goodness for my few remaining eyebrow hairs which i use as a guide i know what do if i lose them my ineptitude is such that i can see myselfwith eyebrows drawn in the middle of my forehead extending over to my ears etc etc in response to hairstyle question still theoretical to me at the stage and not sure what going to do i got tons of complements on my cut and it really did look good too but having had short hair for the past ten years and to be starting again from scratch tempted to see if i can pull off something longer my problem is that my hair gets really really big if i keep it relatively short or it did now who knows edited to add in response to chemopause question definitely still in chemopause the hotflashes seem to have become more frequent and intense during taxotere not sure if because of the drug itself or just the fact that now been in chemopause for see four months at 47 i suspect chemopause is going to turn into permanent menopause if the hot flashes and night sweats stay where at i can live with them i feel like burning up more a gradual sensation of getting warmer and warmer like being in a car with seat warmers and accidently hitting the warm button on the armrest without realizing it linda nadine hope the lasik works and you are peeing all that fluid out of you try and stay on top of it allkmmd you are the first person i have seen taking neurontin i was prescribed it after my first dose of done 4x ac my fingers went numb at the tips and all the nails red and slight numbness round the mouth and the feet were so bad i could only just walk but i am a bit worried about these tabs as the dose increased over 6 days and i have to take them for a few months and they are pretty strong with a whole load of my face has gone very red andthe backs of my hands how are you doing on it i would like to hear your opinion and problems when you get the chance to write take care allanna i had taxotere a long time ago in 1999 my biggest complaint was bone pain but other than that it was tolerable i have finished with my surgery o 8th april 2015 and after that had taken 2 of epirubicin and cyclophosphomide i was suggested to take 4 doses of ec and 4 of taxol bit after taking to tc there was severe infection at my surgical site no healing at all now my onc has decided to put a vac there now i am scared i am just 32 and going through lot of complications er and scared of taking of tamoxifin please give me some suggestions teri i read through the posts earlier in the week and i have to laugh every time i think about beat it i actually told it to a few people and still very funny i have nothing new going on been almost a month on tamoxifen and i tell that i have any side effects except for one loosing weight although i mind a few pounds i really afford to loose too much but thrilled that so far no other issues so happy to hear exchanges are coming up another step towards being normal and i mean that in our bc world sense not that ever be normal after cancer prayers and hugs to you all yes deanna and everyone else i am done i am looking at radiation and tamoxifen next but the chemois over today is day 4 of the fourth cycle which for mehasthe most difficult day in terms of fatigue tomorrow will likely be a napping day too and then i start to feel a whole lot better tuesday here are my summary stats weight loss 7 pounds wig gain 6 wigs gratitude so happy to have a second chance it could have been much worse than early stage breast cancercuriosity the 2 things that have struck me the mostafterbeing told i had breast cancer were that firstly detection through mammogramswasquite ineffectivefor women with dense breasts and secondly that none of the 3 oncologists i saw had any suggestions for a change in lifestyle or diet for me to prevent recurrence the first fact was plain infuriating why have i been diligently getting mammograms when they were not able to detect my breast cancer for years my surgeon guessed that my tumours had been there for 5 to 7 years before i finally found them myself i will be getting mris from now on but how about all the other women who be diagnosed early because mammograms are not effective for dense breasts our health care system is woefullyinadequate in this area thesecond realization that western medicine hasnothing specific to recommend against recurrence of breast cancer beyond general exhortations regarding diet and exercise has led me toinvestigate alternative diets and practices in the search for a better courseof prevention iam still searchingfor answers at this time and so farbelievethat yoga has helped me and that chinese herbshave made a significant difference inmanaging myside effectsduring chemo i am also much more leary about the effects ofgrowth hormones in meat dairy and eggs i will keep searching meanwhile i am truly optimistic about the advances being made in cancer treatment iam hopefulthat the chemo we are getting today will be considered barbaric in a few years because we will be able to eliminate most of the side effects through better targetting of cancer cells i hope we will see similar gains in prevention as well good luck to all be i just started on avastin and taxol the dr says the dose is so minimal that my hair may not fall out who knows who cares id rather have air than hair i had taxol 8 yrs ago with a cytoxin and did not have any neuropathy that time and this dose is less so maybe none this time i had to be taken off of zometa due to osteonecrosis of the jaw so i take 1500 of calcium and only and extra vitamin d im hoping to keep things stable now this is my second time around i was dx with invasive stage 2 in 99 hopefully we can stay stable now tlbradyful i could wait til after recon here are my thoughts so far on tamoxifen i only feel joint pain but tamoxifen does cause changes within the uterus and i already have adenomyosis which is a b9 condition it causes bleeding and pain and the uterus enlarges my uterus is currently 4 cm smaller than they believe because i am currently still in chemopause but at a size than can be removed robotically or laproscopically without having to cut uterus into pieces adenomyosis is sometimes called internal endometriosis because the extra tissue is located within the muscle lining of uterus you want those tissues to get out and attach to thepelvic cavity walls because like regular endometriosis they will still respond to shifts in hormone and cause pain or bleeding one of side effects is this condition grows and worsens it may never happen if i were in true menopause although i am 53 hormone tests still show i am not i might wait it out and see but if any issue then happens the answer would be hysterectomy i am hoping that post diep that is it i can go back to work full time as soon as recovered not saying i may not need revisions but my ps has really good results record with breasts that have the skin and nipple spared that you only need one proceedure i have seen his work on other patients they are very happy to show their reconstructions he even constructs nipples in some phase ones i guess it just depends on patient so if i can avoid complications i really wish to start bleeding again and get it done in one surgery i will i am see an expert in the procedure and he does a one incision surgery flaps not compromised with any holes through the belly button if he can i believe my ps will be on breast upstairs while other dr is downstairs they have done this before and if there are no unforseen issues it is less than 1 hr beginning to end one i get all details i will ask of how i will let you know sorry for long post vivian lou 10 mine is also tamara shenkier and i agree with cndchick when bcca called with the appt with her i was still wanting to have karen gelmon who i think is head of breast cancer and very well known but it would have taken 10 more days and we did not feel that waiting more time was a good idea dr shenkier i think does half bc and half prostate i have a friend who worked at bcca as a nurse for many years and she said dr shenkier was excellent she figured out fast that i need to know as much as possible and for me this has made our relationship really workable thanks ossa for the happy birthday it is sunny too one more year to oas pands getting that port was one of the best things i have done ps plans to take it out when i have my surgery in march but it is has been great we spent the last week on vancouver island and did not have much sun though we had a great time with old friends adagio sorry to hear that taxol was not so good first rounds but crossing my fingers that you get to the end with no more allergic reactions unicorn i still have loose bowels and am done taxol am thinking that my system is still working through the effects of a c then taxol and hope in coming weeks it gets more like normal especially with surgery coming up when i imagine it will revert to constipation i got an email from dr susan foundation yesterday and am attaching the link to an article intervew from it she was diagnosed with leukemia in june and what she has to say now post tx chemo is interesting as it relates to bc which she has devoted decades why would it have to be removed is it bothering you all my fingernails and toenails came off but they have grown back i finished taxol about 18 months ago my nails are still a bit brittle and i have to keep them pretty short my big toe nails grown back entirely normal they are only attached at about half the length that they were but they cause me any trouble hi guysi had dose dense acx 4 tx3 no node involvement and also received a pcr i only received 3 out of the 4 because i developed terrible neuropathy but almost all gone now praying and sending lots of hugs as you all make your decisions g hi new here after taking tamoxifen years i changed to letrozol after 6 months i god heart problems they became so bad that i decided with my oncologist tostep over to aromasin exemestaan the heart problems almost disappeared a bit is left so now on aromasin since november 13 my muscles are tight my knees hands feet etc hurt and i am embarassed by the way i move must look like a 90 year old and thats how my muscles etcfeel to me but my psyche is going better and better feeling good better than ever than the question would you do 10 years on aromatase inhibitors well the pain in the muscles etc is one thing but the heart problem is a little bit still there so i am not completely sure i will go on with this medicin in total i did 4 years on medicins now i will do my five years and then research what the alternatives are good luck to everybody rosa 1 removing ovaries would put you immediately into surgical menopause so no lupron would no longer be necessary you would still have to be on the arimidex because your fat cells and adrenal glands make estrogen hard to know whether the pains you are feeling are from the arimidex or the lupron or a combination of both but joint and muscle pains are very common side effects of arimidex and also with menopause lupron is supposed to be similar to being in menopause so after the surgery you might end up with all the same symptoms plus be without your ovaries for the rest of your life 35 is young to be put into permanent menopause maybe you could try the other ovarian suppression drug zoladex or see if your onc would approve a little break from the arimidex for a few weeks to see if side effects let up and then you would know for sure whether the arimidex causing most of the problems there is also raloxifene which blocks estrogen from the breasts just like tamoxifen does and supposedly is not estrogenic to the uterus while tamoxifen is this has been studied mainly in postmenopausal women but i have heard of some premenopausal women now being prescribed it as well removing ovaries has own potential problems and is irreversible once done so good to research and explore all the other options first syrmom first i am glad to hear from you i was starting to worry and second i know what you mean about the fatigue taxol is hard specially with so many rounds did you tell your doctor that it is tiring you so much and did he discuss with you other aletrnatives to this i sure hope that your scans on the 13th come put with regression or stable but not progression i will pray for you tonight i am not sure about markers you know mine was the lowest when i doscovered my liver mets and till now it is low so my doctor is no longer depending on it are your liver enzymes normal or are they also climbing up in all cases there a lot of other chemo which may work i know if you have seen this post it is a lady called kathlyn rich her cancer became resistant to anti hormone therapy her oncologist insisted that she tries a very old anti hormone med and it is called cytadren and she did and she has been ned ever since would you please ask about this also keep you spirits up i know it isnhard when your body is tired since i have started my combo i also felt a lot of fatigue and i got one blood transfusion and this week my session was delayed for three days thank god o recovered enough to get it tomorrow but in reduced dose hopefully this will be with another one of gemzar my last chemo after it i will get a scan and a pet scan so i know eother what tomorrow hides i really hope your scans will be clear and that hour numbers go back again and i will pray woth all my heart for you keep me informed also write anytime you like and private message if you want i just want to tell you that you are thought of everyday be well and keep your hope it is coincidence maybe but if all is well and i start my anti hormone on the 13th of may i will be travelling to prortugal in europe with my husband to visit the virgin of fatima where she made miracles there be sure that you will be in my prayers carrie just wanted to welcome you to the board and to tell you that this whole thing is doable i was diagnosed in february 2008 surgery april 2008 started chemo tac in may 2008 and then had 40 radiation treatments i am on tamoxifen now and have not had too many side effects mainly hot flashes no mood swings which i am gratful to avoid just wanted to tell you to ask your onc for emend which is an med that you take the day of and for three days after chemo it is a lifesaver and really makes the nausea go away one warning do not take reglan which is also a nausea med but can cause some really nasty side effects which last forever you want this drink lots of water and get plenty of rest we are all here to answer any questions you may have and will also be available for all of the venting you need we will take this journey with you so know you always have a place to come when you need us hugs judy donna i am part of a clinical trial for my chemo i was assured that no placebos would be used there were three randomized arms 1 taxotere adriamycin cytoxan 2 taxotere cytoxan this is the one i got 3 taxotere cytoxan activan new drug i have the option to back out at any time but have been sticking with it i know until maybe a week before which arm i drew my onc was very confident about each arm so i have a problem any of them kind a glad i get the adriamycin because heard the stories about the possible heart problems hope this is information that will help good weekend and no to everyone crystal i had taxol 12 weekly treatments taxol was easier although i did not do well with chemo it was a step up from ac for sure i did get neuropathy i was weak at the time and did not see the signs i thought i was stumbling from weakness even my pt says in my case that would hard to determine but it was a sign of the neuropathy by the time it was really apparent it was my last treatment so i opted to finish it i got a taxol rash on my face and neck dry red and itchy i used creams but it went away after taxol was done and my skin looks great i did have the big d but i had that all along not to sound like a debbie downer just want you to know so you will know what to look for if you get neuropathy and the rash will go away also they say to help the neuropathy take b6 i wish i had taken it during treatment i hope it goes well for your wife and i hope you are hanging in there it gets better p s actually bought the listerine just havent tried it yet i know that a c caused the black nails i thought that that was the taxanes anyway i did 4 a c and had the n v dizziness and so on but was pretty sure it was from the kytril that i had headaches horribly as well as the n v zophran was much better one thing with constipation drink a ton a gallon i drank a 16 oz water every 2 hours the day before and day of chemo and a lot the day after at the very least i know after surgery i did the metamucil for constipation from the pain meds and never had a problem fluids helped with chemo i think meta after the pain pills and surgery hugs and keep posting if you have more questions or pm me about a c if you need sorry you are dealing with it all everyone really is different how they are affected both immediately and the following week what does seem to be consistent though is that somewhere in there there are a couple of really down days mine were when the steroid was finished and then usually after the 7th day or so you wake up in the morning and think oh better still not great but better i had my on thursdays was able to work friday wound down sat and sun and finished my steroid monday morning and so worked that morning by 5pm monday i was nearly a zombie i took tues and wed off work and on the 7th day went back to work i was fortunate i never threw up but did have some gnawing nausea occasionally i lost my tastebuds for about ten days in there i had fec every three weeks and my hair starting falling out on day 14 after my first treatment had it buzzed on the 16th day and that created relief of at least one pain i have just started on the taxotere a week ago thursday and unfortunately did not have a good reaction the doc is checking the lot number because about 4 ladies had similar effects needless to say i am extremely anxious about the next taxotere on the 27th and it is day 12 and all my hard earned head bristles that had grown back are starting to hurt a very familiar hurt lol but you know what i have had 4 out of 6 total chemo treatments i crossed past the halfway line and know there are only about 7 weeks left of feeling like crap before i start radiation in retrospect the time has flown since surgery in august but every third thursday it feels like time has stood still you can do it keep keepin on remember there is a light at the end of the tunnel and all those things you thought you could never ever handle in your life you are handling every step is a step forward ladies drink drink drink it helps and i need to follow my own advice more i think i hope every single day you feel just that much better and remember on the day you feel really low it is just one day and anyone can get through one day one day at a time hour by hour if you need for a bit take all the prescribed meds rest when you can as much as you can keep the faith and remember to ensure you are taking something for your bowels prunes work blessings to all karyll hello to everyone had a good long weekend as the dog sitter at my sisters house enjoyed the company of my canine nieces nephew we had two downpours on the morning of the 4th and so i did not go out to the picnic that was planned just stayed home knitting reading and watching movies on the big screen tv i celebrated freedom by doing exactly what i wanted to do amy you are so cute and lucky to be surrounded by handsome men forgive me for being too personal but i cant tell did you have a lumpectomy or mast your figure looks so good i also had long hair before bc i am also getting lots of compliments on the short hair and so i will keep it this way you do look very very good rosemarie wow you survived all those kids what an amazing mom you must be did you have red hair before or is this a new color after you began getting hair back mine has come back much whiter than previously of course it is the time of my life when i would have expected to see white hair debbie hooray hooray for your good news i am so happy to hear this prayers have been answered sherryhaire chumfrey amy debbie i join you in having some scared moments thinking that cancer might return thankfully most of the time i am not bothered by too much worry perhaps i am in denial or maybe the pressing concerns of my life just crowd it out i dont know sometimes i think a little more fear would help me stay on track with exercise and more healthful habits i worry more about the drop in my motivation to keep exercising every day is another challenge maryanne i hope your lung continues to heal up and that you feel better and better we should encourage each other in the diet exercise area i am trying to lose weight also it is always a concern i agree that is extremely difficult it always has been for me and i am living to regret it kelly i join with everyone else is wishing the best for you i am 53 and was on the threshold of menopause when diagnosed my last period was 3 weeks before the start of chemo back in october i believe that chemo pushed me through the menopause gates my onc recommended tamoxifen for the time being we will reassess again in november when it has been officially one year without menstruation and then i will move on to an aromatase inhibitor if the blood tests show it is time i am overweight and believe that i still have some circulating estrogen from that source i never forget to take the pill but then i have several other pills to take for hypertension and diabetes and so the routine is well fixed for me i dont think you should be too fearful if you forget it once in a while i would think there would be enough of the chemical circulating from your last dose to protect you of course you should get right back and take the next dose on schedule and you shouldnt miss days and days but an occasional missed dose would not be a reason to panic i should think laura i agree with what kelly wrote about still having estrogen in your body even after menopause or removal of ovaries as i understand the adrenal glands create estradiol estrogen through the action of an enzyme called aromatase thats why the other drugs are aromatase inhibitors they stop the enzyme from working but the amount created by the adrenals is much less than what the ovaries create as soon as we are sure my ovaries have stopped producing their version of estrogen then i will switch to the ais the problem with all the drugs is the side effects for me with the tamoxifen i have to watch for increased uterine issues because while tamoxifen blocks estrogen in the breast tissue it stimulates endometrial growth and can possibly cause problems there i also have to be cautious about the blood clots possibility but ive decided that the risk of these side effects is one i can live with versus the risk of more breast cancer in your situation with a different body type and different health issues you have other things to think about you are doing the right thing in asking a lot of questions and getting as much information as possible wishing the best for us all i had lumpectomy followed by 33 rads sessions and in spite of my age at the time 59 my mo decided to put me on tamoxifen for 2 years followed by 3 years of ai he did not want to make my already thin hair due to an accident worse with an ai for 5 years i only managed 4 months before stopping the tamoxifen i could not sleep and it affected my ability to concentrate i am a computer programmer decided to go part time since dx i was exhausted after a few months not taking the tamox i was feeling better then my primary care decided that effexor generic may be a good idea to enable me to start on tamox again this made me feel very odd from the getgo and after 6 weeks i stopped as i had stopped all exercise and had no desire to get out of bed i was just watching movies and falling in and out of sleep when i was not working i have been off the effexor for nearly 10 days and apart from some dizziness and fuzzy head i have my appetite back and am starting to feel better i think i may get back to the gym this week i lost weight on the effexor without doing anything if that was its only side effect i would have stayed on it for ever my recurrence risk was calculated at around 16 without tamox or ai 8 with but i think i am just going to eat healthy get back to exercise and concentrate on qol at 60 its just more important to me personally to be to be able to do things i enjoy now that i have a little more free time and i can live with this risk without worry eating away at me i have no kids or grandkids its just dh and the dog and i want to be able to enjoy things on my bucket list i am going to a long weekend workshop in the summer and it involves some hiking and a long drive to get there and back but its something i really want to do and there is no way i would be able to do it on these drugs i was moderately fit before the effexor if i was younger or had a young family i am sure i would feel differently and want to use everything possible to fight i remember finding what turned out to be cysts in my breast when i was 38 and i felt terrible until i got results i thought i was going to die this time not so much even though it was cancer maybe its because most of my loved ones have passed at an early age and i am still here at 60 and want to make the most of it while i can and the docs guarantee anything anyway shayne i was diagnosed last fall and was prescribed ativan 5mg to help me relax and sleep after i fell apart in the office while they were trying to do a bone marrow biopsy i generally take one at bedtime but do try to skip it occasionally the pa has said repeatedly that sleep is the most important thing and i do feel better physically and emotionally when i am with the start of tamoxifen came the hot flashes really bad in the az summer and even more disrupted sleep and fatigue then i got laid off and was really struggling was given celexa which helped with the hot flashes and stopped the crying i worry about taking multiple meds so i worked up the courage and asked my ro about mmj and she said it was certainly worth trying she had done a lot of research on it and said that it could potentially help with sleep hot flashes and thermoregulation issues i did get my card but gotten to a compassion club yet may just wait for the dispensaries that are supposed to open in the fall even though i grew up in the 70 s i was never a pot smoker i have no interest in that my research tells me that infusing oil or butter and baking with an indica strain is probably the best route for anxiety and sleep so that will be my first step hi everyone finished treatment 16th sept after 3 fec 3 tax and 15 5 boosters rads i am triple negative so thats me all done treatment wise i need to look at managing my stress levels and bring down my high blood pressure as i had it checked this morning and it was a horrendous which is extremely high 41 my doc has said that i have to have it checked twice a week for the next two weeks and if it got below i must go back and see him it was quite a shock as i have just returned from a weeks holiday in ibiza and thought i was chilled out heard about a couple of bc ladies who have sadly passed away last week and maybe this has made me stressed not really sure at all why i have high bp doc also said that i had to try and forget everything and that we all die sometime and to not let it rule my life typical man statement which i have surprisingly let the comment fly over my head has anyone else experienced this and how have you managed stress i would be grateful for any advice i have started taking the herbal remedy kalms as this also helps manage hot sweats and menopausal symptoms supposedly anita purple my onc told me that the chemo really affect the scar tissue around our incisions but the rads will so also a reason we need to have it my techs found out a jimmy buffet fan and played his music for me during tx yesterday i asked them if they could have a margarita ready for me today then feel like i was at the beach nice that trying to make this fun for me takes the edge off of going everyday my hair is starting to grow in i scrutinize it everyday wait to take my scarves off as soon as all of my bald spots have hair going scarfless i already do when i walk just to darn hot saw my onc yesterday he informed me that i will probably gain wt with the tamoxifen gee thanks add that to the 10lbs i already gained from chemo tgifcinda hi everyone i am having nail problems too my last chemo was in august and my nails have been gradually lifting but one on my thumb finally lifted almost off bandaids to hold it on right now is all i can do i finished 4 ac treatments and only 2 taxotere before i caved in and could not do it anymore taking a daily vitamin for hair and nails but it work i guess tracy not sure this holds true for the taxanes which are definitely the biggest culprit for pn but read that carboplatin can still cause neuropathy up to 2 months after finishing the drug since i went from taxol to carboplatin with what i call bad neuropathy i was probably correct not to expect any healing until i was 2 months out from finishing carboplatin in fact it was 3 months after finishing that i noticed my first real improvement you do have your young age on your side for recovery hi lisa glad too hear that your not suffering with the hot flushes and night sweats at least thats one blessing for you on herceptin forever and tamoxifen for at least 5 years out of the two drugs the tamoxifen has been the worst for side effects with me personally of course we all react differently to these drugs and there is no ryhme or reason as to who gets what side effects the weight gain is by far the worst for me not just because of body image but because of balance fallen over about 6 times and landed with a thud very hard and thankfully someone else was with me to help me get up off the floor i believe because not used to being this big that struggling to find my natural balance and one small trip makes me fall over i was always about 8 and a half stone since starting tamoxifen in sept 2011 ive now balooned up to nearly 12 and a half stone done 4 hours of yoga this week and last week walked over 10 miles across the coast path which was lovely but none of it is making any difference to the weight gain my liver is enlarged but this could be left over side effects from the chemo if you are experiencing any pain then keep going back to your doctor they have to address it and at the very least give you some form of pain relief medication a huge box of and take one if i am experiencing any pain sending you lots of love and light xxxx lynne hoping for good news with your scans have mine mid august to see if femara is working i also have mild to moderate hot flashes worse than when i was on tamoxifen has anyone else had gabapentin for hot flashes i take a low dose at night to help me sleep lisa good morning to all you gals wednesday morning you silly sass this is the latest article i found among the zillions i have been through i remember 3 years ago sitting at the while they tried to figure out why this happened to me so suddenly she had this huge book out looking through ototoxic drugs and tamoxifen was not listed she wanted to believe me but find it it their fault actually it my fault nor even the drug company not even the fda and everyone else i sent information to it just happened but putting all the pieces together was up to me and i did it i thought ofsuing someone but this major enough no loss of limb etc just lost my mind ha but it was just recently that another gal on this board contacted me with the same problem when i started researching again on my own and found the rest of the pieces inherited gene tamoxifen stroke in the 8th cranial nerve deafness and she had that same chain of events and was diagnosed with deafness resulting from this gene then taking tamoxifen then the stroke in that exact location which is near the auditory nerve causing hearing loss and it is permanent all when i go back after the holidays i just have questions about type of my hearing aide maybe a different one would work better for me because i can hear better if i press on the outside of my ear towards the hearing aid so maybe one that fits in the ear would be better who knows i can hear but really have problems with unless i am looking at you but if that is the only problem i have i am darned lucky i say you guys just have to talk louder to me ha one week tomorrow since i stopped herceptin and sorry to say that i feel awful just spoke to my onc and he said that herceptin causing what i am calling my withdrawal symptoms which are chills serious nausea extreme tiredness and lack of stregnth to name a few the nausea that i cope with i have been taking tamoxifen so i stopped that in order to try to isolate what is causing me such distress i have also checked any withdrawal complaints i could find on the internet and found some describing many but some it seems anathema to my onc to even think that a herceptin withdrawal could be happening to me could it be caused by tamoxifen and if so why did these symptoms come when i stopped herceptin and not before i am now taking tamoxifen instead of aromasin as aromasin was hard on my bones causing or contributing to osteoporosis of my spine and hip even though i regularly took calcium supplements and boniva i visited a bone jt specialist who aid she was fine with my staying on boniva unless my onc who suggested switching to zometa wanted me on zometa for the extra cancer benefits i worry that zometa may cause jaw and dental problems decisions decisions hi girls just checking in on rads 11 to go going well my skin is holding up and i have some fatigue but have been able to carry on with normal life my hair is coming in fully covered scalp but still wearing my wig to work and headwraps on the weekends know at what length be ready to go bare i was distressed to make it through chemo with eyebrows lashes only to lose them weeks post chemo however they did start to come back quickly ifound that no one really noticed my not having lashes brows i used brow pencil and black eyeliner so i guess that helped at least it made me feel better i use mascara yet but it was heartening to see the lash brow growth does anyone who finished taxol have any residual joint pain noticed some knee pain that i never had before and also my hands seem stiff in the morning aside the from the hair loss that is the only reminder i have left over from chemo good to hear from you lindee i use you as my guide since you finished a month before me happy to know doing so well i hope everyone has a good weekend gina happy birthday nancy the big 50 about the cane and sign love it are you being put up elsewhere or staying at a relatives place is there anything i can do for you bring to you send to you glad the cleanup is underway somewhat you are right compiled with job this is just over the top i sure know all about over the top mel too much about the pain meds i am not surprised when i was in fl last month my mother was sitting at the kitchen table eating cereal at 7 am and her eyes started closing she dropped her spoon twice onto the floor was incoherent i thought she was having a stroke my father and i were on our way out so we insisted she go over to the couch and lie down not before she almost fell forward through the glass coffee table guess what she had put ambien 10 mgs in her pill case instead of evista both of which are oval she took an ambien w her breakfast and it knocked her out cold for 3 solid hours it was scary really looked like as stroke so forgetting meds mixing up meds does happen and not just to seniors re nursing salaries you are right they do vary across the country in boston they do pretty well although pretty well is subjective put it this way well enough for a young girl to pay her rent which many 20 somethings are unable to do in world caya ole ted must have the gag order on the jfk story that be something jackie must be rolling in her grave jan standing up is the first major milestone another week and be even that much better it so brings it all back for me hearing your story did you have extreme nausea after the surgery and did they keep you in this horrifically warm room so the transplanted tissue would take that i swear was the worst part for me being kept in an 80 degree room after surgery when i was soooooooo severely nauseous well today is d day friday the dh was told hear by today on the job yesterday was extremely tense as desperately hoped they wait until the last day to let us know we are very much fearing changed their minds like the last place if that happens we seriously have to consider that someone is sabotaging his efforts to get a job likely the one who sabotaged him at his last job and maligned him all over the internet we went to bed last night at 8 pm just to get thursday over with we were so on edge so friday see i am supposed to be the mystery reader at class this am and my girlfriends want me to see juno w them at noon may be good to pass the time but i really want the dh alone if things go bad just wanted to follow up on my previous post i had my appointment at johns hopkins this past week with my second opinion oncologist i presented my issues to him and asked for his feedback i e 43 years old er pr recently failed my bone density scan lol had my estrogen levels tested and they are too high i also take cymbalta which be mixed with tamoxifen he wrote down all possible options and discussed various trials with me including the soft trial which i have time to wait for lol his choices for me are ovarian suppression lupron tamoxifen and zometa as a side note for anyone interested he said that the two zometa trials and abcsg 12 showed that in patients with breast cancer they had significant improvement in survival when they received zoledronic acid zometa in addition to endocrine therapy interestingly i noticed in the breaking news box of tonight that they were announcing just this information it might be worth researching we are also adding effexor to the mix as the cymbalta that i take competes with tamoxifen whereas effexor does not effexor also decreases hot flashes so that would be a nice side effect lori hi badhairday i started ac chemo on sept 22nd i was prescribed these 4 aprepitant emend ondansetron dexamethasone and prochlorperazone the nurse gave me the first 3 of those meds approx hour before the chemo began and gave me ice to suck on during the adriamycin portion to prevent mouth sores during the cyclophosphamide the nurse told me to tell her if i felt like i was getting sinus cold symptoms i and if so she would slow down the infusion my side effects started about hours later i had nausea dizziness and profuse sweats initially over the next 4 days i had nausea often triggered by food smells or thoughts of food subsequent loss of appetite and of course weight loss fatigue mucous saliva overproduction and heartburn by friday i had begun to crave food again chicken soup and mashed potatoes but often by the time the food was in front of me lose my appetite again or after a couple of bites the heartburn would kick in i took it slowly and just had wee bits at a time by saturday and sunday the initial side effects were really subsiding but i was still losing weight and developing a sore throat i saw the oncologist yesterday and he said it appear to be thrush but rather mucositis he gave me a prescription for magic mouthwash and some other mouthwash i recall the name and something for the heartburn as he thinks that the heartburn may be triggering the nausea so there you have it the only other thing that i will mention is my newly developed aversion to the smell of our little pug to me this is like insult to injury because my little constant companion and all she wants is to snuggle up beside me or on my lap and i know what to do about it naturally i hope that you experience any of the side effects lousy and make for happy days christine drbeall welcome i had my first tx on sept 3rd and felt great until the gi upset bloating on day 3 and 4 after that i have felt normal again i also have 6 tc along with herceptin for a year just think 5 more to go how was your neulasta i felt very minimal bone discomfort i am just praying that as each new treatment goes by that symptoms do not get worse it is difficult with working but hopefully we will continue to feel ok to go through it sorry about your ex i am sure that your daughter is of great help i worked 2 days post chemo and it was fine taking b6 alpha lipoic acid for the possible neuropathies that can occur hard to take pills when i was not feeling well i also put ice on my nails and toes 15 min before during and 15 min after my taxotere infusion and they have been growing like crazy i had also put a nail hardener on before my 1st treatment i will pray for you and your daughter and i cannot wait til december to post that we are all done oh my goodness i feel as if i could have written that post i was put on effexor 75 mg by my oncologist 3 months before i started tamoxifen i have been on it for 10 months now i too have gained weight and am not happy at all i spoke with my pcp about my weight gain 2 weeks ago and she told me that her patients that are on effexor frequently gain weight and are unable to control it i certainly decided i did not want that i spoke with my oncologist and will be stopping the effexor i am quite concerned because i have been reading about the difficulties of stopping this drug i just started the process today and am not looking forward to the side effects of stopping it if i had know this i would never have started it in the first place donna hi beachbum 1023 thank you for the encouragement i will check out the look good feel better i still have partial eyebrows and a few eyelashes and 1 more round of ac on then taxol every week x 12 after that radiation for 5 weeks i already take biotin have since i got diagnosed to help with hair loss and grow back i shaved my head 2 weeks after the 1st ac when it really started falling out did you have any with taxol the fatigue and chemo brain is indescribable with ac and had some women say the taxol is just as bad thank you again i love this site molly poppy and octo thanks for the replies my hands and feet already feel better after one day of not taking it i am thinking i will give name brand arimidex a try i was taking the generic before they switched me to aromasin i have also found that movement helps with the joint pain i feel like i can deal with the joint pain but the swelling i i think probably the fact that i also have lupus figures into the mix see what mo says tomorrow i really want to take tamoxifen and it seems mo prefers an ai for me anyway octo i would like to do a similar cross country trip my husband is already researching vehicles we were supposed to go see in spain this summer but leery about the long flight and travel with my le and pump schlepping that thing overseas seems too overwhelming not to mention the worry about dealing with le while there not the right time for me to go happy sunday to all i finished my 6 taxotere last week nails the nail bed is dented my daughter says i am like a tree a circle for each chemo as for the neuropathy the tips of my fingers are tingly slightly numb and toes are the same last night i dropped a nearly full bottle of floramix it just slipped out of my fingers i realized until then how much the fingers were affected the floramix is for iron my red blood count was so low this week they were on the verge of sending me for a blood transfusion welcome paula jo i know it is a mystery i have been researching natural remedies for anxiety and nothing is fda approved and i know afer dealing with the tamoxifen de i have developed pill anxiety i am afraid to take any freakin thing its ridiclous before if i needed medicine i took it and moved on im afraid to take anything now ugh oh well maybe i need some happy juice tonight if your still on how bout something tropical with an umbrella in it yes yes yes im still spolied lol all the meds i received with taxol were given through the just prior to the chemo itself first benadryl for possible allergic reaction next pepcid for possible upset stomach and finally decadron to help the body cope with the chemo because they wanted these things in my system for 30 minutes before the taxol i received my herceptin for her 2 next and then taxol i took no oral medication and was not given the neulasta shots though our experiences may vary a little the doctors had the same goal in mind to help make the chemo more tolerable for the first 2 weeks i barely slept and when i told my onc he immediately cut the decadron in half from 20mg to 10mg right away i started getting hours each night making the whole process much better he said they cannot eliminate the steroid altogether to all who are about to begin chemotherapy best wishes not all roses but it is always keep in mind the reason doing this god bless us all marsha sharon your posts were very encouraging nice to hear from somebody who has been through it all and come out the other side i just had round 3 of dose dense ac today and am hoping that like you found the taxol will be easier not that had terrible ses with the ac had intense heartburn after round 1 but that cleared up once i started taking prilosec otherwise just a bit of nausea constipation diarrhea feel down and out for 2 or 3 days starting on day 3 but then gradually better so that i actually feel great for about 4 or 5 days before the next round makes it hard mentally to go down the road again but not like we have a choice lksher i just had mastectomy on left side in january with full axillary dissection positive nodes i guess the pain meds are pretty good because i had very little pain had a lot of tingling in the arm and numbness in the armpit but that is gradually getting better with the help of physical therapy they touch both armpits unless the sentinel nodes are positive will they hoping that be necessary sorry your son is having a difficult time with this perhaps once treatment starts it will be easier for both you and your family to cope i certainly found that finally having a plan in place and starting on it relieved a lot of my anxiety and as a result probably helped those around me too will be thinking of you on tuesday hi chris during my taxol tx i had several nails that ranged from discolored to black i kept them clipped as short as i possibly could so that they snag on something and lift i did lose two toenails painless they just fell off in my sock they grew back pretty quickly after all the tc was out of my system i just took it as a sign that the treatment was working good luck take care carolyn heyas i had 3 x fec followed by 3 x taxotere i was given meds to take on the day emend and then some to take for the next couple of days after the infusions felt nauseous but no barfing so that was good i lost my hair about 12 days after the first treatment but got some brilliant hats from do have a wig but it makes me feel more like a cancer patient than the hats do know why just a bit odd like that a brilliant thread on tips for chemo have a read through that chemo sucks but it was and given the reduction in chance of recurrance i think it was worth it hang in there sweetie it can feel like a long haul but you can do this xxxx i was diagnosed with mets to lungs plura and spine just before christmas and so far had 2 of taxotere have 3 weeks on 1 week off add avastin etc etc and then more scans so far the effects are minimal just a little mild nausea and mild tiredness the doc say anything about the effects being cumulative but you are saying the tiredness creeps up on you on taxol and my hair fallen out but i see on bco that others have lost their hair however i know it is working because my are reducing and one of the nodules in my lung has totally disappeared my hair started growing back immediately after it fell out when i was on taxotere but the taxotere was wonderful and i was sad to have to stop because of extreme neuropathy i think that because you lost hair that the adriamycin is not working wait for scans and to tell me what is going on i know that said in the past that it must be working because my hair is falling out but i think that was so feel better about the hair falling out lol hugs they measure it in the pathology also the studies show that about 23 of women lose weight on tamoxifen and about 9 will gain i was one that lost about 4 pounds not to bad some night sweats maybe a little more sadness i am not prone to depression and weight loss my benefit of tamoxifen is only about 2 3 but i am a cancer phobe try it you can always get off if it is too much how my docs presented it good luck nada do you think you might be carrying an infection anywhere sue when i read your post thispossibilityoccurred especially because your white count may still be low from the final chemotherapy six weeks ago thus raising the risk of infection do you have any fever rash ornoticeablejoint swelling any cough urine discomfort etc it sounds like you may wish to see your onky for a quick run through can it be from chemotherapy well the taxanes paclitaxol and docetaxol are pretty well known for causing aching of leg muscles and sometimes bone for quite a while after they are given i had a bad reaction to them with achyness and muscle fatigue and muscle weakness but sudden estrogen lowering due to cessation of ovary function even transiently creating a menopausal like state may bring out joint stiffness and aching in joints in some from what read like fast forwarding our aging process added to by all the drugs given at the same time of the chemotherapy so you might be still afflicted by side effects left over from those powerful drugs a link to a fellow discussion forum on can chemotherapy cause arthritis i took a quick peak and include it because it sounded so similar to your post topic_id 316 hope this clears up fast i imagine you notworkingat a job you so clearly excel at and so enjoy best to you sue and all tender i didnt have breast swelling with herceptin but had flu like symptoms and cardiac damage from the taxol i have neuropathy that doesnt seem to be going away i finished the herceptin last month and think i am getting my strength back finally traci i also had four rounds of taxotere and cytoxan with my last dose on according to my onc the adriamyacin has too many side effects mainly for use in tnbc the chemo as bad as i thought mainly extreme fatigue and the four doses went pretty quickly i did have severe reactions to the taxotere and had to be premedicated with steroids and benedryl hang in there paulsgirl musicalmom you might want to hold off on the hair buzz as i kept my hair even after 4 a c but then after the 2nd taxol my hair starting coming out in clumps good morning all steph i agree with you the taxol does seem much easier than the ac at least the bone pain for me is specific and i can take something for it with ac i was just all over pukey feeling catherine well it is about time you came back on here with all your food ideas we all missed that you mentioned two of my favorites sesame seed and mushrooms any kind your description of your life style is exactly how i pictured you terry thank god for the good news on the lump thingy i guess we can expect to go through life jumping the gun on anything body related it must be human nature tho to expect the worse especially this our histories who the heck wants to be shock and surprised again like we were at dx time carynn i love the blond wig i mean the blond white one in the pix that is a great look for you and with the scarf tied around and the earrings you had a little gypsy look happening there and hahaha about bead boy he probably about died when he saw you probably paranoid the boob flasher is stalking him lol leah i noticed the new picture but think it looked much different than your original pix that i am assuming was you own hair you have the cutest grin vegas well since i am going totally commando with the bald head and all i guess i have to be expected to be normal until it starts growing back went with my friend to get her hair cut colored yesterday and her stylist told me how good the bald look was on my and honest to god said you could pull that look off forever i have tried to make it my own funky clothes big ole earrings tons of different sunglasses in all kinds of colors jan congatulations to your daughter on her graduation is this high school or college melanie be careful telling folks if they hear a southern drawl on the other end of the phone that it is you could very easily be me lol i admit to sometimes playing it up a bit seems people love a nice well spoken southern gal heehee hillary you burned you bangs haha bet you would have whipped that wig off pretty fast if it caught on fire you be careful girlfriend well everyone have a great day heading off for another overnight at my bno friends house she has a pool and i dealt with the whole lopsided bathing suit problem yet but heck it is just the girls love to all marsha keep positive i bought three bags of the cheapest frozen peas and put one on each foot and held the third in my hands for the hour of taxotere only i had slight neuropathy and peeling fingernails after tx 1 and found this suggestion on this site so far so good also started biotin and after 1 33 was diagnosed in 2006 with stage 1 idc oncotype score was 9 no lymph node involvement er pr her 2 i had a lumpectomy followed by radiation been on tamoxifen for about 2 years and approx 8 months ago my ab muscle just below my ribs breast cancer side started aching to where i do ab workouts anymore without it bothering me shortly after that started i started having aching around my ribs on the front side and back it moves around and bother me everyday i had an abdominal ultrasound and xrays on the ribs and spine about 5 months agoall of which showed nothing anyone else have these types of side effects from tamoxifen it feels like soft tissue pain but i know because i have no idea what bone pain feels like my primary care doctor told me that tamoxifen is most likely the cause of this he gave me naproxen which is just a strong form of aleve but it help just made my stomach hurt anyone else have a similar problem thanks nikki i have been on arimidex and zoladex for 6 months i did get hot flashes insomnia crushing fatigue hairloss and bone pain but basically all gone now i almost quit over the se but my oncologist did something smart he said that if the se kept bothering me he would take me off the ai of course that put the ball in my court and i toughed it out i also stopped worrying about the ses and started worrying about my job and other stupid things instead bottom line i am absolutely convinced that hairloss hot flashes and insomnia are largely caused by stress and anxiety however i must say it took iu vitamin d every 2 days to make the bone pain go away just my advice try not to worry it gets better over time and take benzodiazepines end up with a bigger problem i had to slowly withdraw from ativan 10 years ago not fun caroline for your kind words i can completely relate to not giving five more minutes to breast cancer i am very aware of how fortunate i am to have been diagnosed so early i also had a serious heart issuea few years ago related to pregnancy with my little one very limited activity and stamina for first 4 months and took medication for year which really made me tired just had first normal test for function preop for my surgery having radiation on left side made me very nervous and i would have to be monitored very closely if i ever needed cardiotoxic herceptin i have reached a point where i feel like i have spent half of my daughters three years dealing with health think i just want to move on i could possibly stop the tamoxifen if i had may be adding to feeling a little anxious as i told my sister few men would tolerate putting a testicle through what my breast has been through the last six months i am realizing my overall health is so much more importantand my husband supports whatever i chose it is helpful to hear others experiences as i try to decide what my next step should be first evaluation for lymph edema therapy today so hopefully she can offer me some relief thanks again hi ladies regarding the separation anxiety i love that term i does describe what been going through off and on since finishing herceptin last year when i talked to my onc about it she said you are taking tamoxifen you are still in active treatment that is comforting most times but my anxiety did motivate me to start therapy last month and really helpful at first i thought it was just a natural reaction but after several months i decided i need a little help with it my naturaopath suggested therapy when i told her how strict i am with food vegan after finishing herceptin like i needed to build a bigger lifeboat and really hard on myself about it a therapist and i thought i would be able to handle this stuff with the tools i already have but you know what they say about the cobblers shoes or whatever that saying is fitzy woodylb thanks for asking doing o k due to get taxol on monday dealing with edema right now they say due to chemo also some neuropathy little worried about both however scan in feb did show the liver mets getting smaller so want to give up taxol take care jenn_h i have my 11th weekly taxol out of 12 today had some nail problems brown and red streak stains on the thumb pointer and middle finger of each hand no visual changes on ring and pinky but i have pain in them all and when i have pain they all hurt at the same time it feels like someone is trying to pull them out i have a misshapen left thumb but the other one there is an indent at the cuticles when the pain is bad i run a pot of cold water and put my fingers in it and that makes the pain go away immediately it comes back after a while but when the nails hurt its good to get a break i also put this grapefruit seed extract on them and that soothes the nail pain and moistens the cuticles its called gse made by nurtibiotic other symptoms had are tiredness headaches and low red and white blood numbers my eyebrows have thinned and no eyelashes to speak of my head hair has started to grow back and about to of an inch long and feels like baby hair i found taxol much more tolerable than ac no bone pain at all i wish you smooth sailing through taxol hard to see the forest from the trees with chemo as the symptoms are sometimes so all consuming but these chemicals are poisoning and killing the cancer and in months be on our way to health and the rest of our long lives last week i had another tvus which showed my right ovarian cyst was a tad bigger but my left much smaller endo lining down just a hair dr still wants to do hysterectomy but said i can wait till end of summer maybe even nov depending on next ultrasound he ran a test on my hormone levels and just called to let me know that i was not in menopause or even perimenopause this throws me for a loop as i thought that would explain some of the problems i am having now wondering if all the tamoxifen been on it for 16 months now i was having regular periods till the jan then i have one for 10 weeks and now been 3 months does the tamoxifen stop periods i have chemo or rads i have been having many issues ever since my last regular period in jan nausea dizziness night sweats trouble sleeping crushing fatigue memory problems aching joints mild headaches fullness behind my eyes like sinus problems bloating weight gain possible allergies which never had in my life and most annoying of all electric buzzes in my head that just last a second or two all of these symtomscan beattributed to perimenopause is it possible to have normal hormone levels but be going through perimenopause i am worried now because if all this is due to the tamoxifen then it makes me worry that maybe i be taking it i know chemo can put you into menopause can tamoxifen do the same but without necessarily changing hormone levels hi ladies way behind but just a couple of little things lynn and others losing taste buds on taxotere that must be another difference between taxotere and taxol because getting my taste buds back on taxol can even eat chocolate again and all my teas taste good tae with you on the bone pain although session two has been better than round 1 that way i had to drive myself to the hospital yesterday for a muga scan before starting herceptin and it was all i could do to get through it get back home and crawl back in bed all the women on tv lately saying how they can work all through chemo are giving me an inferiority complex they must be much stronger than i am or more fit or something i have one bill of 4800 the insurers are refusing to pay so we are having a on it they claim it preapproved on the silk scarves the tlc catalog and other online places sell elastic gripper headbands which help and also cotton scarf liners that fit with elastic on the back of your neck so the scarves stay right in place on them the scarf liner adds fullness too happy birthday jan and trust me i would so prefer a happy celebrating bunch of friendly women in the chemo room to a very sick elderly lady with a leaky ostomy bag go for it and have some fun skye hi day the reason your docs are talking tamoxifen and the ai is they both work very differently tamoxifen works by blocking the oestrogen from entering the tumor and thus feeding it and the ai block the production of oestrogen in the adrenal glands ai are usually given after menopause be it natural chemical induced or surgically induced tamoxifen is usually given prior to menopause i hope this helps love n hugs chrissyb sue and lauren your approach to is pretty much like mine i do like to read everything i can find but i always consider the source and i always with everything tell myself that no matter what happened to someone else my experience may be different and it usually is are a good example i read the hormonal therapy boards even before i knew need chemo i knew i would be going on an estrogen blocker of some sort for at least 5 years because solidly menopausal i figured it would be an ai then sure enough my onco said she wanted me to start with arimidex because it has the longest track record been on arimidex for 2 weeks and i swear the only se had is very mild hot flashes i would not even notice them if i already experienced 2 or 3 years of the natural kind which made me look for excuses to rummage around in the cold room at work these arimidex flashes interrupt my sleep they cause me to fan myself furiously they motivate me to take off my clothes or stand in front of the open door of the upright freezer they are subtle i can deal with that i know 2 months is not a long time and things can get worse i know arimidex can be nipping away at my bones even as i type this my onco has assured me we will keep a close watch on the bone density even hinted that zometa zoledronic acid would be worth trying but happy to report that so far i have not had any of the joint pain that i read so much about on the hormone therapy forum decided that an ai provides the best opportunity for minimizing the risk of recurrence of my bc tamoxifen even come close to providing the protection i will get from an ai and my onco was clear in her preference for versus tamoxifen as far as dangerous so here we again somewhere we want to be whether chemo rads estrogen blockers whatever otter hi ladies i feel guilty that i chat with you often but am coming to you all now that i need a little encouragement but i guess what we try to do for each other my regular scans ct and bone are all clear the nodes they were tracking are no longer visible celebration right abraxane is doing its job wonderful news but i have had vertigo and loss of balance for 2 weeks and my onc has set me up for a brain ct in a few hours time i had steroid withdrawal so put it down to that but gone on too long i have no headaches or nausea no signs of a head cold but have had a husky voice for a while so maybe there is an underlying infection there hoping inner ear and easily fixable a bit scared so i want to celebrate and will if all is ok but am a bit scared so other than my husband you ladies are who i want to share this with a problem shared is a problem halved right i feel better already hey i think my left ear hurts will get back to you as soon as i know more cheers all angela workmother on weekly taxol had 3rd one today not dd so your mileage may vary but here are my answers to your questions i clipped my nails short but they are growing super fast much more than in times i put polish but you should only use clear because you need to see what is happening to themnails and polish will clip them short and put on polish clear polish i like a color on my toes does it matter does the tree tea oil absorb through the polish frozen gel packs will bring them to my treatment put them on my hands and feet do you wrap them around your hands and feet keep them on the whole time i think my treatment last four hours you also need to use remover very packs check with your onc center whether they frovide gel gloves and shoes mine does they are provided by the taxotere company then they are already frozen and easier for you my taxol tx is 1 hour i change the gloves and shoes after only need to wear them for 10 mins before the taxol and after not during all the premeds and any saline you get nails and nail beds are still quite tender and one nail has stopped growing longer like the others and is covered in white had ac tongue problems but seem to have them with taxolthe bone pain i get from taxol is minor and fleeting no neulasta with weekly tx not bad enough to take anything but others report that they have it worse i take any meds with the taxol on my own i get benedryl and dexemethesone by iv right before the tx and it no nausea at all about bouncing off the walls i bounce but i sleep the entire night after a tx on the other hand i get a huge anount of tasks done at home i take ativan right before each tx but no other time i find it really helps i was feeling really sick before and during txs and it wa just from stress noit working at all through txs but i could probably work through taxol definitley not ac i just prefer to invest my energy in more impt things and i have insurance that lets me do this helps cassie i am 43 and had my last period right before i started chemo back in april i had no bleeding or spotting the entire time or when i had surgery in september or since i started tamoxifen a couple weeks ago and so far no sign of a return my toenails are a mess they grown at all since august i have some lifting on my fingernails but at least growing out i suffer at all actually i am on the lowest dose of citalopram which is a much more benign antidepressant than effexor and i am wondering why anyone would give anyone two different antidepressants with the tricyclic being very fatiguing i have trouble sleeping i have been taking 1 mg melatonin which takes a couple of weeks to actually work it has to build up in your system anyway if i take it before watching a favorite tv program i end up missing it try to walk each day exercise helps relieve fatigue lifelover please re evaluate those drugs all of them can put you over the top for drowsiness etc the antidepressant can be increased and by itself can address any pain as mine has altho i would try not to take effexor because it is a big gun do not take any diazapams vallium etc more sleepiness and more depression i take tamoxifen the first go and ended up with a second primary which was enough for me to start taking it and deal with it fortunately all seems fine but who knows down the road as onco wants to switch to a i in third year as to hot flashes even gals who take tamoxifen get them part of growing mature exercise helps there too they are actually a good sign that the med is working i have muscle bone and joint pain that got more pronounced right after chemo ended but has gradually been improving my mo says from the taxotere now weeks pfc i still have fatigue as well but that is more likely due to radiation which i just finished 2 weeks ago the only se i can directly pin on the herceptin is a runny nose i noticed any adverse side effect to the 30 minute infusion and prefer it as in and out of the chair and on my way fairly quickly for me a c was worse several days of needing the anti nausea drugs and just not feeling well with taxotere i have just had mainly fatigue with some stomach problems d a week or so in with both i had a couple days of pain but that was due to the nuelasta shot i got the day after chemo rather than the chemo itself hi 3 months after my last dd of taxotere recently started loosing the discolored nails but it hurt as the new ones grow under the old ones and then the old ones drop off so far lost 4 toenails and 2 fingernails however can see be loosing all toenails and more fingernails infact the baby toenails new ones will be replaced another time there seems to be no end to this horrid journey consider myself as an expert of falling nails lol sending a hug and positive thoughts erika canada had to have a nap today was a little much however i believe you are right while not listed as a side effect of tamoxifen i read this obscure study that in postmenapausal women thryoid issues show up about 3 months exactly the time i have been on it and disappear at 6 months are so if this is a somewhat known side effect why do they not list it my dr says the depression is also tamoxifen related and today i guess just lost it i wondered why i was the only one on it that seemed to lose weight and if it were cancer very slow moving one chevy use to get what are you on now i have tried everything but femera and the others were worse curiousgood gosh does this ever end hi mary kate zoladex puts you into a temporary menopause so you will have the same symptoms as the menopause unfortunately as it happens so quickly whereas a natural menopause takes several years to wind down the ovaries they can be quite severe i had zoladex about 4 years ago and the 1st 12 months were bad for hot flushes but calmed down after that i also used to have achey ankles 1st thing in the morning which i know was down to the zoladex as when i stopped it so did they even tho i was still on tamoxifen the things that helped me were wearing natural fabrics and no long sleeves using a magicool spray from boots chemists etc and having a fan by the bed at night if it got worse there are some threads on here about a chillow but i tried one out luckily wine seem to make them any worse so at least i could cool down with a nice glass of white wine afterwards 2 years i did get my periods back if this is any help to you despite being told that my age 41 may mean go straight into my natural menopause hope things get too bad and pray for a cool summer nicky dragonfly good to hear that you have a plan i had herceptin every 3 weeks with the taxotere and carboplatin i think my onc does it because it accesses the port less often to minimize infection maybe and also it is sortof easier many women have it weekly though during tch effectiveness wise i think the two approaches are similar as far as i know one thing please check out icing your fingers toes during taxotere infusions to hopefully prevent nail problems if you are interested i have a couple articles you can pm me i also used an elastogel cap to minimize hair loss and i can tell you about that experience as well pro and con are any of you ladies who are currently taking aromasin on anything to help build bone looking for a medication that will help prevent bone loss but i am leary of trying zometa because of the onj syndrome but i want to find something because i have osteoporosis forgive spelling another decision i need to make thanks debi day 13 for me all seem to blur together these days welcome to all the new girls this is a great place to share support and learn i have become very religious in using my aquaphor it helps so much even in the folds under my breast i just stand the gentian violet anymore the alcohol in it burned so bad so no more purple grapes janabananna oh to be perky in any position would be nice lol when they move me around on the table its like trying to harness jello anniebear i like the idea of making the tattoos into flowers mine circling bees hummm wonder where the hive should be lolon another note tamoxifen i started mine before rads the on doctor wanted to start me before since i was high risk family history etc and yes the hot flashes are a pain but mine are slowing down some question to group do any of you feel fatigued from rads or is it the driving daily back and forth the stress etc i just seem to be blah all the time slow moving mind fog just not me joan sometimes i have this weird feeling that if i have to give up a breast and if i have chemo then i really experienced breast cancer but i have had so much stress and loss of control and i still have to do rads and arimidex i had almost these exact thoughts especially when i compared myself to a close friend who was diagnosed even younger than me but recently we attended a breast cancer awareness program and met three other women who were diagnosed at about the same age as me 40 at first mammo all three plus my friend told me in no uncertain terms that it cancer lite it was cancer and just because i have to do chemo make it any less a cancer yes i got lucky b c it was found in stage 1 and i had all the best possible results in my tests but i still had to have surgery and i still had to have rads i advocated for myself and followed my suggestion for mammosite even though my bs said it standard of care for someone as young as me and now that started my tamoxifen it turns out that one of the ones who ended up with ovarian cysts but then again my ovaries went into overdrive after i started tamoxifen this summer so i just started lupron too so even without chemo gone through my fair share all of this is just to say feel like you had to suffer through more than you did in order to feel like you reallyexperienced bc you did i did we all did i hope you were able to put together a good medical team and maybe have already started your rads rare to find everything under a single roof unless you are in a closed hmo like mine kaiser or seeing your doctors at a major cancer center in a big city and my docs are actually spread out over 3 locations but as they work together all the time they are amazing at staying in touch with each other and they all have access to all of my info i wish for you a similarly cohesive for rambling feeling the insomnia tonight joanne as i read through these posts i remembered back a few months when my fears worries and obsessions were exactly the same as what i am reading i was terrified of losing my hair being too sick from chemo to function and traumatized by the unknown there were people that came through for me and told me their experience everyone is different but there are many similarities i discover the lump on 12 saw the doctor on 12 had the mammies grammed and an ultrasound on biopsy on and was told i have idc on which happened to be the four year anniversary of my death from lung cancer i had a bilateral mastectomy with tissue expander placement on 12 the were expanded over thenext two months i had a portacath placed on andibegan chemo on the tumor was cm positive sentinel node disection grade iii triple positive agressive cancer agressive treatment is what the oncologist said i am so so glad i have the port particularly because i have herceptin treatments for a year i watch mostly women come in every week and have to be poked two or three or four times to get an iv started because their veins are so blown from the bag after bag of crap the port turns out to be easy the access it which has always been painless for me the area gets calloused then there is a connector that they use to plug in each bag treatment is tch every 21 days and herceptin every 7 days for the first 18 weeks then herceptin every 21 days for the following 33 weeks 33 daily external radiation beginning 12 five years of tamoxifen that semed daunting truth is today i had my fifth tch the first treatment week was the worst i know what to expect i thought they would hook up a bag drip it in andi would go home it turns out they started me with 30 minutes ofsaline 30 minutes of benadryl 30 minutes of famotadine 30 minutes of steroids then 1 hour of taxotere 1 hour ofcarboplatin and 90 minutes of herceptin arg that took forever i developed a metal taste in my mouth the day after tch and food did not taste very good the anti worked for the most part but the food tasted so so bad i slept most of the first four days after i did not eat and lost six pounds in two days i realized i was weak because i eating or drinking on day five i forced myself to eat bits and pieces of a banana or piece of toast a yogurt or some nuts just anything i use only plastic utensils and do not cook in metal pans the metal taste for me last from day after big chemo until day 16 then i get five days where the food tastes good and i eat i felt better after my second treatment which also took much less time as they go slow the first treatment to watch for negative reactions it only took four and a half hours the second treatment i ate better and slept less i have felt better and better i am more fatigued but i am less nauseas and just feel generally better i have the neulasta shot the day after tch that shot nearly killed me the first two times as soon as i had the shot and then stopped the steroids i got incredibly bad long bone pain when i had the shot in the shoulder the pain was in my neck and back when i had the shot in the stomach the pain was from my hips to my feet after allowing the shot to leave me suffering for days i called the triage nurse and explained i had been taking oxycodone and ibuprofen and nothing was touching the pain she told me to take 3 aleve naproxen immediately and then 2 every 12 hours she said the next time begin the night before the neulasta shot and take them for days after the neulasta shot as it is a 10 day time release that solved that problem even need the oxycodone i also started acupuncture which is supposed to increase your immune system i go twice and week and it keeps the nausea completely at bay now the steroids have a bad effect on me i get roid rage i feel like beating people up and taking their food lol my oncologist has lowered my dose considerably there was a time when he asked if he should put me on haldol for those of you that know that is the drug they give to subdue people in mental hospitals uh no thank you i did lose my hair i had cut it shorter and it was coming out by the handful 2 days before my second big chemo i had purchased an expensive wig and a bang piece and several hats i had never heard of the cold caps i shaved my head 19 days after my second big chemo i have worn the wig twice i feel like it needs tape to stay in place and the wig tape tears my skin off the wig squeezes my head i look dumb in scarves as i have a very short forehead and i opted from the day of shaving to rock the bald and wear cute earrings the loss of the hair on my head was not as bad as i thought truly it is the nose hair i miss things can roam freely in and out of my nose with nothing to slow them down and taxotere makes your nose run nose hair is the unsung hero of the face i will be grateful for its return i know someone is worried about nails i have worn acrylic nails for 13 straight years i had them professionally removed before i started chemo i went to the beauty supply and purchased an led light for 50 and some led cure gel top coat i trimmed my nails very short painted them with two coats of regular polish and then baked on the gel coat with the led light the polish last three weeks and i have had one nail that has split a little but i used the gel top coat and baked baby back in place it has been easy as all get out and i get tons of compliments the long and short of this story is that it is much scarier to think about than it really is i am 47 i have seven kids between 15 and 22 i have a full time job as a child protective service investigator that i managed to continue to work until october 29th now on leave i have continued to live my life a little slower right now but living i even walked the 5k race for the cure five days after big chemo i was last to cross the finish line at number 3704 but i did it yesterday i developed lymphadema in my legs and am forced to wear these really sexy compression stocking on both legs i put them on and laughed hysterically the oncologist prescribed them for at least a year and told me i could possibly need to wear them forever at this point excuse the language but who gives a fuck i just wanna wake up on the right side of the dirt for the next 50 years get this cancer gone give me some 20 year old stripper boobs and lets get my food back to tasting like food i would also like a little head hair and all of the nose hair but cancer can keep the leg hair they are so silky smooth you can do this ladies keep the humor laugh oftenand loud go to the local department store and try on silly hats and takecell phone pictures that is always a hoot i have pictures of myself in a 100 different hats scarves and head bands i pose and wave a laugh with my friends until tears stream down my face it is very cathartic cancer sucks but kicking ass feels phenomenal go get it girls this cancer know who it is messing with hugs believe 1 i am doing the taxol 12 weekly does and will be doing 4 this week day seems to be the worst abdominal pains and very tired since i have treatments on tuesday it is friday night and sat that is the worst and it is certainly doable maybe when you start your taxol weekly you can choose the day for treatment that makes day when someone is around to help with kids i work 20 hours a week for a appliance store as a bookkeeper an have not had any problem with working i had husband take me first week so he knew what happens at treatments but since then a different friend has taken me each time i get to sit and talk to someone that i enjoy catching up with and the day goes by much faster the first two weeks they give the taxol very slow to watch for reactions after that they give it much faster i get herceptin every 3rd week too which adds another hour to the treatment that day have been out before 2p m every time the port will hurt for a week or two before it heals it made sleeping rough for a couple days since the breast on the other side was still sore from surgery i slept in a recliner for a day or two until i could sleep on my side again you can get thru this you will have to protect yourself from the sun this summer because of the chemo but you can be outdoors with your kids just remember you need to put your needs first and take care of yourself they need you to get thru it and be the mom they remember again when it is over most days you will not feel bad just let others take care of you when you are feeling that way the steroids they give you when you take taxol were a bigger problem that the taxol itself so far gave me temporary type 2 diabetes and have to test my blood sugar 4 times a day it does not happen to everyone but it is a possible side effect they will watch for on your blood work i also have acne again like i was 16 instead of 61 from the steroids i will be thinking of you annette oh too i had my first taxol treatment april 2 and the bone pain was excruciating for days afterwards i took vicodin left over from my mastectomy and it barely took the edge off glad not the only one apparently a common side effect three to go how many more do you have itsok ask your onc for something stronger taxotere is literally a pain taking dilaudid on the the worst days because i get an itchy reaction to percocet thankfully the pain only lasts days for me i hope the same or less for you i just had 5 of 6 of tch and have had bone pain each time i hope feeling better soon hi ladies sorry been mia for a while i work on my good days and rest on my bad days been a hard couple of days i had my 2nd taxol treatment on wednesday gave myself my neulasta shot on thursday and by thursday night i was feeling the pain all over and to top it all off i chipped my molar tooth today while eating bread that had been dipped in my soup how does that happen i have to wait until tuesday to call my dentist since they are closed on mondays i just feel like my body keeps breaking down on me i am hoping the bone pain gets better soon on a positive note my last taxol and final chemo treatment is in 24 days so counting down the days now i am really behind on catching up with everyone so i apologize for not responding to your posts the way i usually do try to do a better job of keeping up with you ladies i have a hair related question for those of you who wore the caps and kept your hair and then went on tamoxifen i have been reading that some people lose some hair on tami has anyone experienced this if so how much do you shed i am four months post tc and the shedding is finally slowing i am starting to use a blow dryer on the cool setting and it is so wonderful to dry my long thick hair so quickly again yes thick thanks to pcc it is still dry so i only wash it once a week but no flaking still using bees shampoo and having good luck with it hang in there ladies off taxol now for one week but still incredibly fatigued but on a positive note no neuropathy and may lose one toenail hair is returning and is that no color called dishwater blonde but how welcome it is now have to endure mentally until august 19 when i will have modified radical mastecomy and all lymph nodes taken when i expressed concern about lymphadema the surgeon assured me that 70 do not get it at all she was not sympathetic she may bea smart and skilled surgeon but appears to be lacking in empathy as for chemo what i know from my experince is the adriamycin the red punch color causes hair loss i had 4 rounds of the adriamycin cytoxan and then 4 round of taxol every two weeks it can also cause hair loss then gave me the neulasta shot the day after the day before the taxol infusion i took a steroid to decrease allergic reaction to it welcome newbies this a great bunch of gals sherri been praying for you hope for b9 results get your rest still not for sure if i should get the gene test done well finally the last of band festivals today state bound tomorrow big day tuesday at am since there are some parents unable to go like me they will be streaming it live i think the pic is of wood chips but some already said that well here it is 7 days after ac treatment 2 hdangelbaby i am also on the 12 taxol weekly treatments following 4 ac dd i am also hoping that the stomach issues are a bit better my onc did say that the weekly taxol tends to be tolerated better as you are receiving less meds more often of course the down side is it is every week so i guess we shall see my husband cut my hair real short but left the top a bit longer i think it is coming off today though it has made the mess a bit less but i am still conscious of not having a wig on i assembled my hat hair today so we will see how the golf hat look goes for me as well my head is sore but not awful the end is near for these lil hairs i am afraid so far eyebrows and eyelashes are ok anyone having issues with them that kinda freaks me out to have no eyelashes feeling pretty good just go through days like today of feeling a bit sad not sure why but my husband said about this day last round i went through this also hopefully like last round i will be 100 by saturday and enjoy a few days before we do it all again i have worked since my last treatment except today as i was feeling a bit icky getting ready for our grandson to semi permanently move in the middle of feb while his dad goes to japan for a few months i am hoping that having him here will keep me distracted it certainly did over christmas but his bedtime didnt come early enough some days i must admit happy new years to everyone 2011 is just waiting to be a great year leigh hi just started taking tamoxifen on thursday nov 8 four days in and the only side effect so far is nausea i have noticed some aches i have been short tempered but i am not sure if that really is side effects yet i have trouble sleeping but when i brought it up to my onco she told me i needed to discuss it with my pcp she did say that if i have problems with hot flashes that she can give me something for it also she stated i needed to take vitamin d and calcium i am not taking more pills the vitamins cost more than my prescription and over 5 years this is going to get expensive just for pills good luck to you all hopefully we wont have much side effects to report hugs to you all robin i have been surprised to not be recognized i barely recognize myself these steroids are doing a number on me oh well this is just a phase right someone asked me how taxol round 2 went it was not great i felt fine on day two i had started gabapentin which is supposed to help with neuropathy my onc had recommend it over the hydrocodone i had taken round 1 which was the only thing that touched the pain i started feeling pinching in my ovaries on the night of day 2 here we go i took tylenol i took advil later i had body and muscle aches so bad i finally broke down on day 3 and took the hydrocodone and then i felt much better the onc nurse gave me her thumbs up i have also had issues with swelling i drink and drink and pee the taxol is tough on kidneys so they gave me some lasiks and that also helped a lot i am not used to being on all these meds i used to take vitamins when i felt ill now i take those at all so weird i just wait to get this over but i dread getting back in that chair i hope everyone has a restful weekend we will get through this class ost_sig dx 2013 idc stage iiic grade 1 er pr her 2 surgery 2013 mastectomy both reconstruction tissue expander placement both chemotherapy 2013 adriamycin cytoxan taxol i am in uk where cold caps are used quite frequently i was advised by a bc oncologist friend in sweden karolinska institute that there is a small risk of scalp mets since the freezing prevents the uptake of chemo there have been documented cases albeit pretty rare as for taxotere myy hair did grow back although thinner than before my eyebrows and eyelashes are very sparse and not their previous strength here the oncologists do not advise about any of the side effects their attitude seems to be that patients will then report all kinds of side effects because they think they are experiencing them they also did not seem to be very on the known side effects such as taxotere rash i wish ihad known what to do regarding my nails all of which felt as though they had been hammered and then subsquently turned funny colours and some dropped off my big are still weird 8 years later with an extra nail growing undrneath causing pain and unsightliness very liitle regard seems to be given to the side effects of these very powerful drugs it is just throw the drug at the patient and hope for the best i had a c dense dose every 2 weeks then i had taxol for 8 weeks i started having neuropathy in my hands feet i wish they had just helped me with my symptoms i was then switched to taxotere which was the worse drug i took it was like all the other drugs together did not like it at all so that is my 2 cents worth triple neg is beatable we have to be proactive in our treatment nj congrats on finishing your 5 years of tamoxifen i couldnt finish mine because of severe bone pain so glad you were able to finish yours and with out to many se good for you hey jenn i think i have much the same effects from taxol too weak and achey but not too bad nausea comes and goes a bit nasty acid reflux heartburn though my dh bought me some prevacid instead of prilosec anyone know if that matters this one says to take it first thing in the morning before eating so i used it yet i really need some tums to chew on i guess i am using pain meds to help with the aches just to get comfortable in bed so i can sleep looking forward to getting thru this this week i have numbness and tingling in my fingers and feet too as long as it goes away i can cope with that i can eat most of the time anyway i feel hungry until i start to eat and then go off food quickly still trying to drink gallons try some carbonated drinking smart water most of the time about all i can really stomach b123 many women are er and not put into menopause that is what tamoxifen is for premenopausal women many women continue to have periods while on tamoxifen i was premeno when i started and nobody ever mentioned doing anything to change that however i did end up going through natural menopause during my time on tamoxifen but heard of many women who did not go into menopause lupron actually turns off the signal to the ovaries to make more estrogen thereby temporarily shutting them down until the drug is stopped well i guess you two have proved me wrong about hair and abraxane man mine came out all at once all in one shower it was very upsetting i expected it to be like a c where it came out a over time hope you both keep as much as possible for as long as possible dromedary going for my third taxol friday it hits me later than the ac did and seems to persist a little longer since i feel generally more achy all the time having trouble discerning whether having muscle aches from the taxol or bone pain from the neulasta i took the claritan with ac and only was achy one time on a day that i walked a lot the bonus is allergy season has been pretty awful in the northeast and it has certainly kept my seasonal allergies from adding to my misery as far as pain killers are concerned doc told me it was ok to take an ibuprofen or tylenol i suffered so much as to need anything stronger yet but i do have leftover oxycodone from my surgery and i am not afraid to take it if necessary will ask at my next appointment we actually plan on doing a little family weekend in philadelphia in two weeks i absolutely plan on packing the oxy in case all of the activity hits me too hard on arimidex too and my joint pains too bad but my bcn did tell me glucosamine chondroitin is brilliant and to buy it from the high street health shop whenever on sale stock up she did say though that if it made any difference after 6 weeks or so not to bother as it would show up by then if it was helping i just manage it with ibuprofen my symptoms hot flushes are my worst ones tbh but in fact too bad and i will be coming off arimidex shortly while i have my chemo so will start again once over with too bad at all but i know they are worse for many women still i would not hesitate to take them to help keep this embuggerence thankyou for a superb new word terry pratchett at bay gemini hi i lived innova for 10 years in springfield i would recommend that if you make the switch from tamoxifen to an ai that you ask for a bone density scan first as a baseline if you have not had one recently because tamoxifen only blocks the receptors but allows estrogen to circulate and benefit bones and heart switching to an ai may cause bone loss and lead to osteopenia osteoporosis it is important to know your status on this prior to starting an ai ais come with many of the same side effects as tamoxifen but because they suppress estrogen as opposed to blocking it there can be additional problems such as higher cholesterol joint pain sexual side effects etc many of us have had to switch from one to another to find the one with the least se for us as individuals the generic versions of these drugs are made with different fillers and these are what can cause some side effects so if you find one that works for you itcan beimportant to try to use the same manufacturer consistently you can usually set this up with your pharmacy good luck hope everyone had a nice july 4th weekend i have been out of town with no internet which was kind of nice went up to lake tahoa wore my compression sleeves for the change in elevation had no problems started tamoxifen too and so far so good utmom 2014 hang in there you are almost done with chemo sorry about tooth issues i had a fake tooth cap pop out during chemo my mo said as long as the dental work was not done during my nadir time it was ok my dentist was great and came in over a weekend for me to fix it what a great yep i am in chemo pause too and hoping those ovaries are shut down for good my mo said for about 50 of woman in their mid 40s their ovaries stay shut down however for the other 50 the ovaries can restart even with low levels of estrogen what you need to watch for because 5 years down when you are done with tamoxifen if your ovaries start producing estrogen even at low levels if you are switched to an ai it be effective on the estrogen produced by your ovaries so you need to keep monitoring your estrogen levels i might end up taking my ovaries out at that point it is a wait and see approach because they might say it is ok to take tamoxifen for longer periods of time by then also jeanh my dh loves to rub my head because the hair it is soo soft my hot flashes haven been tolerable started during chemo and have gotten a little bit more frequent with tamoxifen but so far manageable although i just started last friday with tamoxifen knock on wood hopefully it get bad my hot flahes arrive like clock work though start around 5pm come in waves but during the day nothing kind of wierd but i will take my eyebrows came roaring back i was going to pluck them and my dh is begging me not too he says i look cute with my soft fuzzy hair and dark thicker eyebrows so i will refrain for a while figured he has had to deal with quite a bit with all of this so i make him happy with not plucking for a while julieh glad your skin has held up well during rads yeah two more to go actually you are probably down to one as i type this tomorrow you will feel great because one more phase of your treatment will be over i started restorative yoga too had to stop because of my neutrophil levels being low but i really liked it and plan on starting up again once my levels have returned oh yeah even though i finished rads a week and a half ago i went for my lab work last wed and my neutrophils had tanked to 900 again yep neutropenia for me so i stayed away from people up in lake tahoe and just relaxed on a deck reading a book i felt great though i think they dropped because two days after finishing rads i went with my older son to his freshman orientation which was a long drive and just did too much walking and not enough resting plus we did not get home until almost midnight the night before my blood test so i get new labs drawn tomorrow and if they are good i am allowed to resume yoga again considering the problems i have had with my blood counts through radiation i am so glad i was given the neulasta shot during chemo otherwise i think i would have made it through chistine 47 how much vitamin d have you been taking to get your levels up my were low and i have been working to get them back up i am taking between iu a day my mo said if my levels stay down with my next check up with her in a few weeks she might give me a prescription strenth dose enjoy this short work week hi everyone i am new to this forum just started my tch last week today is day 11 my cancer was left side iia estrogen her 2 did i say all that properly i get 6 tch and then just the h for the remainder of a year which is 11 more treatments radiation after the tch portion and then tamoxifen whew i have a port the first treatment went great totally different than i expected no fatigue just a bit of constipation diarrhea heartburn all manageable and i will be more prepared next time but no nausea at all however you knew there was a but coming right a day or so after the treatment my forehead started to break out now i am 51 and this never happens to me but it seem too bad until it got worse and worse and worse today is day 11 and my hairline jawline behind my ears neck chin and some on my chest is covered with bumps and pimples painful and gross and totally unexpected as i have not read anything about this in lists of side effects i have read about the dry skin but this is oily and red and pimply like a teenaged boy no offense to teenaged boys out there i feel sorry for them now i called the onco nurse on wed when it quite this bad and she said it might be from the herceptin and there was nothing to do about it until my body got used to it but it is continually getting worse now and i am getting to the limits of being able to hold it together emotionally i want to go out or see anyone which will not be good for me done so well otherwise and have been feeling more and more confident until this happened has anyone experienced or heard of anything like this thank you so much in advance amy carol i am sorry about your neice this is an area i truly understand we have worked over a year to get the right combo of meds so i am a functional human being tamoxifen interferred with almost everything and caused more depression just hang in they will get the meds right during the last year i begged to go into a nursing home or inpatient evidently i am not nursing home material but now i am glad we worked on meds i think i have been on avastin taxol since may being working so far knock on wood hard to tell what side effects are from what drug but so far my main side effects have been neuropathy taxol bloody mucus in my nose avastin and fatigue not sure if avastin or taxol by the way for what worth also er pr her 2 i had my second infusion today and got home about 3 hours ago so far so good i was relieved that i experience the allergic reaction some of you have with the 2nd treatment i had already started the claritin so i know if that helped i used the frozen gel mitts and slippers that the treatment center provides again this time i took a tip from melrose and cut the fingertips out of some old knit gloves so my fingernails would get the full benefit when i described the sharp stabbing pains i had in my head and elsewhere after the last treatment my mo said they were caused by the effect of the taxotere on the nerves neuralgia and he prescribed something called metanx it turned out to be pretty expensive even with insurance i found a coupon online too late but if this stuff helps use it for my refill it seems like mainly used for diabetic neuralgia and neuropathy vitamins in a form that is supposed to be easier to metabolize my mo also recommended acid an over the counter supplement i had a few work days last time when those stabbing pains in my head made it very hard to focus so hoping that be so bad this time not scheduled to work today so i need to use sick time my schedule varies i went out with my dh and the 3 doggies for our walk after we got home tomorrow neulasta hoping for the best again this time and hope all is well with all of you dear sisters hi judy the redkin rough paste 12 is fairly easy to find most hair stylists carry redkin products and beauty supply stores would likely have it but you could probably get it on line as well mine cost but you use so little each time probably good for a year or more like special effects rough paste has no odor or greasy feeling weety 911 if you even have of hair the paste helps to tame those hairs that are a bit stray and longer than the others i was suprised that i could actually do something with it when it was that short mai 605 sometimes ya just gotta laugh at the craziness of all of this i find much more likely to smile at a funny joke or laugh even if no one else is so either becoming a nut case or really enjoying my life a lot more these days i prefer to think the latter glad i could bring a smile to you tamlin 110 i had adriamycin and cytoxin first and all my hair fell out looked like howie mandel when i started taxol i was totally bald but hair started to grow back just around treatment 4 or 5 like you i asked my onc and pessimist that he can be he said it will probably fall out again well it and i am now finished with taxol and on herceptin 27 down 25 to go and i worn a hat or wig since the middle of october i just measured my hair with a ruler do you believe what we do to check hair growth and it is 2 long i think i have been very lucky since my hair always has grown fast to think i used to get annoyed because i needed to get a haircut every weeks never complain about that or a lot of other silly things i used to complian about again pam patmichaud love to sail carolyn got a great support group on these boards hang in there and soon be the ones welcoming the newbies but oh how i wish none of us had to welcome anyone else to this club have a good weekend everyone geri i am off to meet my ro on and as i am 10 years post menopausal i am going to ask about an ai as an alternative to tamoxifen as i am already a chronic insomniac that requires a lot of unisom or other benadryl type otc sleep medicine also lorazepam when i get anxious i have tried all the more natural melatonin etc type sleep aids and for me they are all totally ineffective i know that i cannot take tamoxifen with my otc sleep aids and i am already only managing maybe 5 or 6 hours sleep at most i am fatigued most of the time then usually fall asleep in the afternoon for 2 or 3 hours with no sleep aids on a weekend when i finally get exhausted years of being in a rotation have wrecked my sleep habits and i have finally decided to quit my job in the fall once i am through the rads etc and can work out the insurance which is currently through my job i just cannot cope with being woken up or the fear of being woken in the night for work any more i will ask for heavy duty prescription sleeping pills for the nights i am not on call only 4 or 5 more weeks of on call i hope ever if the treatment worsens my insomnia i want to refuse the on call until i leave unless i feel too ill to work my immediate colleagues are really nice and there are only a few of us to cover for each other they had to cover for me while i was off for a week due to the surgery and also my future appointments and treatments and they get tired too they are not young kids either one thing i have recently found helpful for me however although i have no idea if they are good or bad for people are asmr videos on youtube i put my headphones on and get a virtual scalp massage or listen to relaxation techniques like breathing and relaxing my muscles and i do eventually fall asleep listening to them although i shut my computer lid as i just want to listen not watch a video when i am trying to sleep it is kind of weird i guess but anything that helps they are very relaxing linda thanks yeah last year was not my favourite feel 1005 better lots of energy air and breath how are you so glad you enjoyed your visit with your sisterfeisty being on tamoxifen for 4 months last year caused a blood clot and i ended up having a heart attack glad you are on warfarin this is not to be messed withdemson oy bc is not what you needed but you are clearly choosing life because you are reaching out and seeking information good for you this is a place of support and love and kindness you wrong here i tried an ai the fall after i was taken off of tamoxifen lasted twmonths but the swelling scared me because of my heart i have not had any medication and just had a clear mammogram my second think anyone can give you the numbers other than your oncologist have to weigh the benefits with the problems it can cause lots of women have no problems at all remember too that most folks who do not have problems on it do not seek out the advice of others which we have all done here so we are not necessarily the norm hmm just he ones looking for so sorry to hear about your dad perhaps you were the canary the strong one to teach others how to be when the diagnosis came sending love and positive vibes your waypaula yeah information is indeed security at least it gives us the feeling ofcontrol of some kind hmm ladies i just accepted a job in the middle east teaching english leave mid august managed to mess things up at work this week by asking for a leave of absence for a year did it as soon as i heard word on the job and am in fact giving two months warning prior to th ecourse i was to teach the fact that i did not tell my boss specifically where i was going has led him to chastise me like a three year old i really really need to learn how to let go i will still have access to this site but boyoboy this has been a weird week i am soooooo sick of appointments soooooo sick of crap feeling lighter and know that leaving is a good thing but holy i amnot surprised but still disappointed silly hmm i was allergic to the taxotere and i have a 3 hour drive to nashville fortunately my husband and sons took turns driving me for my treatments the benadryl really makes my sleepy the dose pack my dr prescribed was a life saver not only did it cut way down on the fever and rashes it reduced the nausea and intestinal upset a great deal i was really lucky my white blood cells remained good throughout the treatment and i did not have to take any booster shots god bless everyone deb hi ladies i had my last taxol march 9th no more chemo i woke up this morning with the usual taxol as i mentioned before has been very difficult for me i am hoping that the neuropathy will not be permanent my hands fingers and feet toes are constantly tingling numb and pins and needles i will have about a week break before starting rads hoping all of you are getting through the week and as ve1787 says better days are ahead hi all i finished my 4 and have now completed my third of 12 weekly taxols the taxol is giving me absolutely zero side effects i come home from chemo take a 2 hour nap and back to normal for the rest of the week i take my dogs on 4 mile walks the same days as chemo so no nausea bone pain or neuropathy the steroids dexamethasone that are driving me nuts in the year before my diagnosis i lost 30 pounds via weight watchers and jogging so i was at my perfect ideal skinny weight this spring when i met my 27 year old fiance he is in the navy so seen me since i started chemo in the past 6 weeks gained twelve pounds still on weight watchers and am walking from miles a day and doing workout videos each evening on my second taxol my onc agreed to give me only the normal dose of steriods on my third taxol he cut it to the normal dose but still the weight keeps climbing is anyone else having this issue has anybody stopped the climb and found a way to take off the weight are any of you doing taxol without any steroids at all going to visit my fiance in turkey in 5 weeks and desperate to ditch these 12 pounds before going thanks sharon in missouri i breezed through mastectomy and chemo then felt like i hit a brick wall with radiation i never truly knew what tired was before because such a person however i managed to work run errands socialize etc i just hit the sack at night around 00 instead of my usual however the tiredness for me come on until about week 4 of 6 my radiation onc kept asking you tired yet i finally said no just have to try harder lol what i get for being sassy but a month later i felt worlds better and back to my usual monkey business rads may not be as hard for you i had other things going on at the same time that probably worsened my fatigue starting tamoxifen a staph infection zometa infusion sinus crud known women who experienced no fatigue hi estepp i just wanted to send a big good luck hug to youfor tomorrow when you begin your taxol and herceptin you can do it and you will be fine time will fly by and you will have all the tx behind you before you know it last november i was exactly where you arenow and here i am almosta year later with hair and just 3 more herceptin tx to go to finish up my year yay i was a bit tired during the taxol but worked every day except treatment days and made it through fine thanks to the nice ladies here on this board the herceptin is our miracle med and will keep us going on forever like the energizer bunny take careand pamper yourself and get lots of rest during your treatment my best to you mary jo oh what a cute dog lyzzysmom i love it when photos capture their eyes spookiesmom that sounded awful googled the hand foot syndrome before and one of my main hesitation to chemo was taxotere because of the side effects thus far am okay peeing more today and i think i will keep up with the juicing and my regular diet of loads of fruit vegie with fruit hope all my 4 cycles will be a breeze am a bit concern cos my doctor order neulesta or gcsf shots for me so i assume do it only if i need it instead of prevention my oncologist like it because of the bone pain cause when herceptin and taxotere would already give heaps of bonepain adriamycin is a strong drug so you have already something powerful that works did you stop after just one shot of taxotere tempted to walk my dogs again tonight still a couple more days to the possible lowest white and red blood cell counts i found the 4 dd ac unbearable and had to stop after the 3rd blood clots but sailed thru 12 weekly taxols with just fatigue and minor neuropathy of the toes my fingers were fine 16 months later and the neuropathy is still there but causes no pain just a little numbness for some reason altho i am only 2 er my mo has me on anastrozole believe me that causes a lot of aches and pains the first year was ok but now a royal pain pun intended i am 69 my question is does anyone else here take tamoxifen or anastrozole even when you are tn or close to it i have to decide by october if i want to continue on it i am waiting to see how my second year mammo goes hello all i had the last of my at today and received all my info on the next and hopefully final leg of my journey i will start on feb 6 with the carboplatins and go weekly for that infusion i also start the xeloda which is actually in pill form that i will take twice a day for 7 days and then off for 7 days he had originally told me 6 rounds of this but today he said 8 i was little pissy i said make up your dang mind so it looks like i will be getting to do this for 24 more weeks not thrilled but am happy about the prospect of hair coming back and if i remember correctly it should start fuzzing up in about 6 weeks so should have enough hair to emerge into public without fightening any small children in my store around july i hope has anyone purchased a wig from paula young i found some new hair in their online catalog but am a little worried about buying it without trying it on first any opinions out there i am also looking at one that is human hair instead of synthetic they seem to really cost much more than what i have paid here and i kinda like the idea of being able to change my style somehwhat deb your right we can go through this together and since your a ways ahead of me you can keep me posted as to what to look out for sorry that i did taxatere instead of taxol so i tell you what to look for but i can tell you that aleve works well for the bone and joint pain take it as soon as you get the neulasta shot wait for the pain to set in i found that by being proactive it was just a dull ache instead of the horrible pain i had in the beginning those of you still searching for the perfect water try figi its the only one i drink now has no aftertaste and just tastes wet little pricey but i could care less at this point as always my prayers and thoughts to you all deb hi sarah i have been on letrozole since march 2015 and for me the joint pain subsided whatsoever i daily take an ibuprofen and try and walk at least a couple of miles a day it is such an effort and same with me getting up in a morning or when i have been sat a while last month i had a bone scan as a precaution as the joint pain was so bad thankfully it came back clear i have had a chat with my lovely breast care nurse and she said i could change to tamoxifen if i wanted dubious and decide whether to or not also my cholesterol has gone up another side effect of femera but then a catch 22 as this tablet is hopefully keeping the cancer at bay love judi x i started the generic arimidex anastrozole in january and now months later i have really bad depression even though i take cymbalta for depression scared lose my job because i concentrate and focus at work and just sit at the computer and check mail and news all day reluctant to switch from one drug to another and only swap one bad se for another i take any time off work because i have sick leave and ask for any more from the sick leave pool until september have you been down this road how did you and your dr handle it i even have the energy to read most of the info here on ses of arimidex and its generics thank you donna good morning so glad the weekend is here for those of you who have asked i am a reading specialist who has been working with older students high school and college for the past several years and i decided to make the move back to my first love elementary school be working with students this year who are learning to read i love the first graders and with those who are struggling with their reading skills it has been a lot of work getting things set up this past week but i think i am ready for school to start on tuesday my kids start school on tuesday as well please say a little prayer for my little guy that things go ok on his first day of first grade cheri you are certainly getting a lot of mileage out of those flowers so glad that you liked them i had laryngitis when you were in the hospital and i wanted you to know that i was thinking of you even though i talk to you on the phone deb glad to hear that your surgery went well cy great news you are in my prayers every day charlene i had my ooph at age 38 there were cysts on my ovaries and because i had a highly estrogen positive cancer my onc and gyn both recommended that i either take lupron shots or have the ooph the surgery was laproscopic and i had a few days of pain but it certainly did not take 6 weeks to recover i have gained quite a bit of weight due to the sudden menopause and the fact that i eat too much and the hot flashes were initially quite difficult but they have become less bothersome i worry about the long term effects of the surgery too but if it buys me more time with my kids it is worth it vickie you have such a kind heart diesel will be well loved in your home for sure nicki good for you for standing up for yourself just keep waving that finger at dh madison thanks for all your work on the the surprise for gina you are the best gina so glad that you were able to get to the post office to get your afghan and scrapbook i hope that it helped to remind you how much we all care for you iris i hope that everything is all set with your car suz i did the same thing with the school supplies i went out and bought everything on the kids lists plus a few extra things that were on sale then while looking in a closet yesterday i found a box of extra stuff that i bought last year and put away so that i have to buy supplies this year gonna go broke if i get my brain back soon colleen i hope that i get to see your psa whenever i watch channel 7 sit through the commercials denise and casino girl yeah a teacher i hope none of my students parents ever find out about my antics at pinkstock shirley i have a huge phobia about mice and rats and whenever i hear a scratching noise in the attic i convince myself that it is just a cute little chipmunk that has come to visit good luck with your flying rodents i know that missed many but i need to drive a friend to the airport have a wonderful day love to all from a to z sue kerri i am so sorry about your son a terrible tragedy and totally understandable that you would be afraid given that history had 2 of 4 rounds of taxotere and cytoxan the week before my first treatment i was so fearful and anxious i discovered that the treatment was much easier than i feared yes had side effects all of them are totally tolerable fatigue hair loss fleeting nausea the first few days constipation neuropathy on the second week that goes away by the third week runny nose dry skin thrush and a few mouth sores on the first week post treatment loss of taste for a week i had an allergic reaction to the taxotere at the start of the second infusion but it was easily handled with some benadryl steroids and slowing the infusion truly the worst thing is the hair loss and that is temporary check out the cute headcovers at i wish i could reach and hug all of you getting ready to do your first chemo i know the fear and anxiety but take courage from those of us that are further down the path you can do this they may be sort of right that estrogen suppresors cause joint pain because a lot of women especially young women seem to have a problem with them but but i am positive they do worsen pain from existing conditions no matter how trivial they were to start with my tiny bit of demonstrable osteoarthritis shown on hurt so bad that i use my hands first thing before taking tramadol and neurontin in fact i developped trigger fingers from only 3 pills of aromasin after stopping the meds for 5 weeks i have made a remarkable recovery but not complete i just had injections for the trigger fingers and if this work face surgery since i have a low risk of relapse my oncologist has said ok to just not take the ais btw i get a hysterectomy or other surgery for the sole purpose of taking ais i would certainly try tamoxifen first if i had a diagnosis since nearly as good keep my parts and not risk undergoinga pretty bad surgery and a 3 month recovery debiann as you can see we always have one that throws us for a loop mine was my 2nd i had mad diarrhea after the 1st one nausea vomiting headache and everything else so they cut my dose of taxotere for the 2nd i expected better well i ended up hospitalized with renal failure not to mention i was in the hospital when my hair started coming out after that the tx were better lol they also cut my carbo for the 3rd so why lolyou will get through it though much love 8 weeks in on weekly taxol i have too many problems with nausea but feel like been hit by a bus 2 and 3 days out from chemo my hair came out in clumps 3 weeks in so i shaved it and bought a wig for work it looks great but i hate the way it itches so apart from work i just go around bald i really care what other people think it has started growing again but is so patchy and scruffy i went to the local barber yesterday and shaved it all off again hello all i have been waking with intense liver abdominal pain at night for quite some time it started with herceptin and taxol and got pretty brutal there at the end taxol ended 07 for the last few weeks of taxol the pain was 4 nights a week it has certainly subsided some and generally once a week now the question i am on herceptin until 08 are any of you ladies experiencing experienced the same pain and attribute it to herceptin or do you attribute it to taxol i was blaming the taxol but the onc says no way that was out of your system within 3 days i say never been on the shit and really know about the real side effects now would he symptomology seems like taxol unless it was the herceptin the whole time do to the reduction in total number of days per week of pain i believe it is just remnant taxol released from fatty tissue after exercise as generally the nights coincide with those days thanks for the feed back i am not on very often so replies will be slow in coming all the best to you all keep up the fight peregrine 38 log in to post a reply hello i am also on arimidex and the joint pain in my wrist is so bad and my knees onc wants me on tamoxifen but there are so many more side effects i am afraid to take it but not sure what else to do i go on with this joint and bone pain i also feel about 80 i had pleomorphic lobular caner in the breast i just want to have a normal life again with my wrist pain it is hard to type i have been off the med for about 4 days just needed a break and will have to restart soon has any one taken tamoxifen for a long period of time and what type of se did you have new to the group diagnosed on chemo starts taxotere and cytoxan for right now know about the her receptors until tuesday so that may change everything also having a pet scan on tuesday he has given me zofran and ativan for nausea but i read about headaches with the zofran any suggestions to change or just see how i do not doing a port right now and i worry about my veins too supposedly get 2 3 chemo 1 x q 3 weeks then surgery keep putting up all the wonderful posts they are extremely helpful i saw my mo once a month for the first 2 visits pfc and have now graduated to every 3 months i started tamoxifen along with rads for me i think it has made much of a difference i think i would be just as tired if i was just doing rads theresa go for the maroon why not dye mine if it so patchy i have a very sudden stop to hair growth from the middle of the back of my head down looks really weird like i have a bowl cut back there hahaha i can just now feel the stubble of new hairs coming in lower and closer to my neck i love the color purple and might go that route as long as i have to bleach it white first want to damage these new little friends my eyelashes have finally gotten long enough to put on a little mascara i had to shave my leg hair once i could start feeling them blowing in the breeze they were freakishly long and clear i was told not to take benadryl but when i had a really bad cold i called my onc to ask him if i could take just one he said as long as i took benadryl two hours after taking tamoxifen it would have been metabolized and it was ok i take t in the morning and took benadryl at night when i have really bad cold or allergy symptoms hope that helps diane hot flashes are the worst doctor said menopause but i think not had 3 of the worst periods on chemo and there are right on time i had my first doc w herceptin yesterday and an over night at the hospital so far so good just happy to be done with fec and the 12h vomiting hugs to everyone not feel so great hang in there thanks everyone for your responses i just found these being new to the site still finding my way around an update on my treatment i had six rounds every three weeks of 4 chemos carboplatin taxatere pertuzamub and herceptin two weeks after last chemo i had a lumpectomy with 5 sentinel nodes removed that was a nightmare for me because first the nurse practitioner told me they would be putting wires in my breast and they be using local anesthesia thankfully that was all worked out long story short answer it would have been nice to know all about what the procedure entailed before hand and yes i did get a local anesthetic after all all marginswere clear including around the tumor which is good news 4 days after surgery i continued with herceptin and will continue every three weeks for a year i am two weeks out from surgery and still have some swelling but am starting to feel like myself again they want to do radiation every day for 5 weeks with a 6th week of boost still researching whether radiation works for her 2 unfortunately nothing out there to be foundand no studies done only hormone driven breast cancer studies still wrestling with the risk to my heart and lungs on the left side as well as radiation causing other cancers along with other side effects i need peace about having radiation my logical mind says no but also are there any her 2 positive survivors over 10 years i agree with eal 69eal the dexamethasone would have been given to prevent an allergic reaction not make the herceptin more effective i used to take oral steroids before having taxotere because of chance of allergic reaction they used to make me feel so awful that i always take the 3 days course but with herceptin i only had the iv piriton to lessen chance of reaction and this was given prior to herceptin so i had no choice but can honestly say all it did was make me feel very tired i had herceptin for 12 months with just piriton hi guys this is for alk too i have just completed my last 4 treatment cycles of taxol and taxotere in early nov i began the herceptin chemo during those as well since my last taxotere tx i was switched to taxotere after only 1 tx of taxol as i developed nuerapathy in hands and feet i began the herceptin on their own this is when i noticed a rash that began on my right lower arm it spread to my upper arm and shoulder and now after completing my 2nd herceptin chemo it has worsend and is now on both arms and shoulders it flares up mostly at night causing major itching and burning i am not sure if it is related to the plethera of hot flashes i get both seem to become most overwhelming at night when my day ends and i finally go to sit and relax whih is around 9pm or so i too have been to see just about everyone to seek treatment for it as it is causing so much disfunction in my daily activities as if all the other items i have arent bad enuff ya know anyway here are some things i have tried lyrica nerve blocker cortizone cream 10 extra strength ice packs and my most recent is dermaplast usesd commonly for wounds or sunburns out of everything i listed i think the lyrica if taken regularly which is 4 times a day at 50mgs coupled with applications as need of the dermaplast seem to work best the dermaplast is an immediate relief however it requires frequent applications throughout the day but who cares as long as your night suffering with rash i have an appointment after the holidays to see a dermatologist but am not anticipating much help to come from them as i am sure they will say the standard from your chemo well no shit really would love someone to prescribe something that will knock it out i have small chicken pox type blisters or bumps all up and down my arms with new ones forming just under the surface of my skin which i can feel if i run my fingers lightly over my skin between the ones which already have scabbed over that is my 2 cents on the subject i wish i could say that it ends with the taxotere but it seems to me that it is the herceptin chemo that might be perp i also have swelling in my legs hands and feet this also started when my taxotere ended and my herceptin began in tx by itself so i feel that my side effects basically began after reg chemo treatments ended and herceptin was administered by itself i will not be done with the herceptin until august like bluecowgirl i took effexor too for the hot flashes and have since hopped off that after a month because i felt it was making my rashes flare up worse at night no peace for the wicked its amazing to me that our oncologists are unable to help us since most of the treatments to breast cancer with or without a positive diagnosis of her 2 people seems to be cook book i have been off and on again with taxotere for the last 2 years which i believe is a sister to taxol all in all done probably 21 treatments it fun but doable no hair and some nail issues but energy level too bad good luck edie posted in several days and was sorry to hear about your swelling mel heard that taxol is tenacious but that se do go away i still have the neuropathy but a little better done with radiation this past week and my skin is fine just a little tan my onc prescribed biafine a lotion with a copay of 30 who knows how much it costs but i think it really helped is it too late to weigh in on the hat emma i think cool but i agree that you might find all that fringe a little distracting go without but i am probably saying that because i have to go you should wear what makes you comfortable hoping that everyone does well in may husbands likewise carrie i know you starting rads till after the next lumpectomy but you might want to stop using soap and hot water on that side now i did this on the advice of a survivor not a doctor and i know if it helped but i have a lot of se from the rads i am glad to be done but weird because done triple neg so no tamosifen herception arataomase whatevers i feel as if i should be doing something i keep resding asbout no alcohol and no fat diets but i say following that as yet and most likely never valerie and maryann what arwe you doing trying to get a picture of my hair to put up on the site but so far it show but there which is more than i can say for my eyelashes oh and did anyone see the new york times article on the confirmastion that chemo brain is a real thing going to have it laminated and the next time i put the wash in the washer and forget to turn it on or forget words or whatever just hand people the article and say read this penny i am one who switched from arimidex to tamoxifen i was determined to do well on the ai and gave it all i had but after 15 months i cried uncle i had usual of stiffness joint pain hot flashes and could have put up with them but i became so weak that i could hardly rise from a sitting position i exercised like crazy and took all the good supplements but got worse and worse i stopped arimidex for one month and started tamoxifen tremendous improvement i do have hot flashes always in the evenings but i can put up with them so far everything has stayed good my ca is still low and i am ned hope it stays that way good luck last month i convinced myoncologist to let me stop tamoxifen for a month to see if this was the source of my overwhelming fatigue i really sure what find out but about two weeks after stopping it i began to feel like myself again and the energy returned i am back on it i have another year left it has helped me tremendously to know this is the source of my fatigue sparrow i started to have joint pain shoulders hands just after i began rads i was three weeks pfc and yet started tamoxifen the neurooncologist i saw last week figures arthritis he said it can appear weeks or even a few months after chemo if i had started tamoxifen i would be blaming that not sure whether you or others complaining of joint pain had chemo but if so another possible cause letrozole side effects my mum was diagnosed with secondary breast cancer 10 years ago and treatment was thankfully successful since then been on tamoxifen with no major problems however 10 days ago she transferred onto letrozole and has been suffering with various side effects ever since to the point considering coming off it she has had far more hot flushes and swellings which have been reported but not acted on etc but the main problem is causing depression each morning which switches off around the same time each day plus she said she feels really angry and moody very unlike her natural character making her life miserable has anyone else been in a similar situation and can anyone shed a little hope that the side effects might settle down really reluctant for her to come off it totally due to the improved life expecancy hi everyone been reading but am finally jumping in to join you marienj great to see you here your hair looks so good it must feel terrific to be able to go wig free i maintained a reasonable amount of hair to sort of cover my head until the 9th of 12 weekly taxol treatments within the three weeks pfc the rest of my hair eyelashes and eyebrows fell out the lashes and brows are coming in already i have a tiny bit of salt and pepper hair coming in almost to the g i jane level i also discovered that i have a similar hair line and style as curious george i bought the nioxin hair care system at the salon i go to but started using it yet anyone here use it was it helpful when did you start about of the way through six weeks of radiation then will probably be on an ai for 5 years not sure how everything will affect the rate of growth thanks for all the tips and pictures you share here my hair started coming back on taxol but my eyelashes and eyebrows fell out almost as soon as i started i took tamoxifen for years and am now on femara until april 2010 it will have been about years on the femara as well unfortunately it seems that both have similar side effects the hot flashes plus for me the chemo and a subsequent hysterectomy for unrelated reasons threw me into instant menopause additional effects for me were the joint pain insomia weight gain and inability to lose weight sounds like what you are dealing with i too was afraid to stop taking it so just tried to make the best of it with excercise which helps the weight and joint pain and took melatonin for my insomnia the hot flashes have eased alot over time so hang in there even with the discomfort of these side effects alot better than the alternative in the end time will pass more quickly than you think this past 5 years tho so difficult during my treatment have really flown by thoughts and prayers to you and all others dealing with treatment and meds renay welcome caroline jo and sherry are right this is a good place to come and feel connected to others who are in your shoes never had a question i posed on this thread that i get feedback on you can talk about whatever you like serious or not been taking tmox since 12 sept 10 i get occasional hot and cold flashes they usually too bad anymore except when they wake me up in the middle of the night last night crapola my toes cramp when i am pointing them doing yoga sometimes and i get funny pains in my legs which stay for a few days and then go if you get a side effect let us know somebody will have some wisdom for you and just that will calm you down we get back to you a lot quicker than your dr will hmmm i get anything about coffee or soda or tea i drink my share of each of them though i do drink plain water at home for the most part i had my first full chemo infusion on thursday felt pretty lousy on friday though i did manage to work a half day came home at with nausea and body aches yesterday was mostly body aches and little energy and today hitting the fan my tongue is hurting every joint in my body hurts and the bathroom trips have begun made it kind of hard to run the few errands we had for did manage to get groceries but manage to make any purchases at lowes for the house moving to good thing we have no time limit interested to see if i lose any hair this week from the failed taxotere two weeks ago i had a bunch of side effects from receiving 30 seconds of t before it caused a full blown anaphylactic reaction a couple of weeks ago something new every day it laura ladies i have reached my 5 year mark and am hoping to get off tamoxifen for good i am interested to hear from women who have been taken off tamoxifen did the se go away did the weight gain go down did you feel better did your oncologist suggest 10 years if you got off tamoxifen was it cold turkey or gradual decrease idc right stage 1 er pr at age 49 bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction right sentinel removed no left involvement chemo 4 rounds taxol and cytoxin no rad one more taxol treatment here numb lips here but my tongue goes through lots of changes for a week after treatment from numbness to tingling to burning i have a wound that has not showed any signs of healing after two weeks and 3 different types of the chemo is not letting the body heal self also on to radiation for me got my tattoos molds etc done on monday we are going to the beach for a few days then i start daily radiation for 6 weeks on june 16 somehow that is not the way i envision my summer but oh well i just started doxil last week after being on lxempra 3 months never had any problems with any other chemo except this one at least i think my problems are from the doxil severe nausea and appetite loss a lot of bone pain although it state that as one of the side effects the pain is excruciating at times not trying to scare you but wondering myself if anyone else has had this experience with doxil good luck to you i am cancer free and i am done with chemo onc saidi have to have my last tx i told her i do any more taxol because of the neuropathy so she said there really much point in doing the carboplatin by itself i was almost as excited as hearing my scans showed no cancer its like a gigantic weight has been lifted bf and i went out for pizza and they told me not to have recon for at least 6 months too i know for sure when do it i was thinking next summer when my parents are up for 3 months so they can help but see my chemo acne is slowly improving but yeah having facial hair issues too i had that the first time i went thru chemo and i think it lasted very long been running buzz clipper over it seems to work well i really think using a regular razor was a good idea the clipper leaves enough that it looks more normal and no 5 oclock shadow to deal with why do we have to deal with all of this weird crap mouse i am on taxol also i am taking glucosamine and my onc in ok with that i am taking it for the joint pain i know it was supposed to help with neuropathy too i think my onc said b6 may prevent neuropathy i need to pick up some hi all i am feeling so assaulted i now officially have no eyelashes i find this just so insulting after all this no eyelashes i just want to spit there is no end to the trauma of this my eyebrows are also so thin now you can barely see them well they are blonde anyway but really i just find this so rude one insult after another my hair is like peach fuzz i feel like such a mess bald healing from boob surgery eyebrows hardly there keep on keeping on right ugh i think i am feeling a bit better from the surgery but still needed both motrin and vicodin today and all the stool softeners colace mirilax suppositories just to go one more drain came out did i tell you all that remember with my chemo brain one drain to go three gone now drains are another insult priz girl i think you now have a rectal fissure feels like razor blades when you go would you almost rather give birth i am sorry this is a real literal pain in the ass i stand it ac started it i would almost get it healed then another chemo and more contipation almost had it down to healed then surgery and all the meds that cause more constipation i have been nursing this fissure for months and i am about to pop already ugh you need to really soften things up you want hard goings wiht that fissure i have a buffered compounded gel from my proctologist to help stimulate healing julie yay for survivind taxol 1 i would feel perfect for a few days after dd taxol then sometime on day 3 the achies would start and a bit of tired that lasted a while then was gone not so bad rally after been through ac anyway not sure it will be the same for you with 12 weekly vs 4 dd though let us know jane all that going on and still did the laundry go girl genia glad you are somewhat better girl maybe turned the corner whinin and moanin spring i go for 2nd taxol next monday i too have had bone muscle pain this sucks day seven and still some aches i am having chemo prior to surgery i had a rough time on taxol bone pain and especially when combined with the neulasta it until i was prescribed oxycodone 5mg that i found any relief i took pill every hours on the rough days i also experienced severe itching of my hands atarax hydroxyzine every 4 hours helped tremendously i finished two months of ac and then finished taxol on may 1st and all my side effects have gone away hi ladies i had my last tch back on and can tell you that time does heal all wounds i was prompted to jump in about the sleeplessness i used tylenol pm the fast acting gel ones are a little more expensive but in half an hour i was falling asleep and getting 6hrs they didnt give me that groggy hangover feeling either try just one at first and if it doesnt work take the 2nd the tylenol helps with all the herceptin aches and the neulasta hurts too i have 10 rads left then just my herceptin until november i take biotin to help my hair recover and am now going out without a wig or cap i would equate it to a susan powter look from the 90 s if any of you can remember when she was doing her thing on tv stop the insanity the biotin also helps with my nails that taxotere trashed so bad they are finally growing out healthy tch is so much better than the ac w t cocktail much kinder to our heart my onc says that being her 2 is slowly becoming the type of bc they are able to say they can treat the best because of herceptin and he believes that in a few years they will say it will be the one they can cure because of the advances in drug therapies so if i must have the dx at least i have a beast i feel i can beat take care all cheryl not alone i know if there was a place for high risk women here i had two months of testing mammogram diagnostic mammogram stereotactic biopsy and wire guided open excision biopsy been diagnosed with atypical lobular hyperplasia and have been placed on tamoxifen for five years so far been on it for one month on and off more off than on my primary prescribed effexor xr to help deal with the hot flashes and super huge surge in anxiety and depression yay me twelve days into the effexor i began to have esophageal spasms they occur in 2 of women who take this medication so i had to drop the effexor i can deal with the hot flashes i can deal with the headaches i cannot deal with the increased anxiety and depression my breast surgeon seem interested in hearing my complaints she says to take it up with my primary or gynecologist neither of which are familiar with prescribing any medication while i am on tamoxifen and are hesitant to do anything so i battle the depression and anxiety and continue to suffer with incredibly heavy periods the breast surgeon said she mind me taking a break to address my other issues taking a break and will wait until she and i talk in june this doc is a big wig at stanford and grateful for her treating me but i feel broken now and have nowhere to turn 966666 i experienced terrible nausea while taking tamoxifen but it seems to have subsided i used to take metformin as well and when i stopped taking the metformin the nausea seemed to gradually disappear i really should get back to taking metformin and i will see whether the nausea returns the nausea on tamoxifen and metformin was often so bad i had to take medication such as gravol travel sickness tablets it make a difference what time of the day i took the tamoxifen either it also seem to help if i took t with food yet when i felt nauseous eating something would help quell the nausea i started taking t in may and the nausea became increasingly worse in june and it was awful in july august i stopped taking metformin in september i used to take metformin in the morning with breakfast then feel most nauseous all afternoon and i still usually take t at around 11 pm before bed taxol 2 in the bag 2 more and half way through chemo 10 more taxol there is a light at the end of the tunnel feeling some tingling in my toes tonight and i sincerely hope i am being paranoid and this the start of neuropathy can it start this quick on taxol been on the big t since january 2010 my oncologist said discuss it next year the worse side effect is weight gain and hot flashes for me but the peace of mind for me is worth it all my grandma was so concerned about recurrance she refused to go off it and stayed on for over 15 years before she died other causes i know someone else who is a nurse and put off her own mastectomy since she did not want her high school years to be consumed with cancer and instead went on tamoxifen to keep it from growing it worked he graduates this year and then she can deal with her surgery after that but she went over 2 years just on tamox and they monitored her well it does seem to work hi becsthanks for checking in first gemzar was easy compared to lxempra my next gemzar is tomorrow and then again next tuesday 3 weeks on 1 week off mostly just fatigue had to nap day 3 and a little day 4 praying it will bring liver lesions down especially big one 4cmx4 9 cm really want abaltion on big one with liver abalation you can get that done and still continue chemo we will be able to tell if working if my tm comes down it was 1300 yikes need this to work or trouble looms boo blood work still good you are getting two agents and i only wish you good results my feet were so bad from 30 taxols and 7 lxempra had to take break from chemos that cause neuropathy quality of life etc etc you take care becs still fighting you too good morning ladies kat 2nich hope you are doing well you went yesterday correct ruthieg wahoo last one skydiver good luck today wishing you the best lmlola 59 ok i use google chrome as my browser and since the last time i posted this website kept telling me scheduled maintenance i kept checking back and the same thing finally i decided to switch browsers and open internet explorer eureka it worked so perhaps others are having this problem hence why not that mom is getting stronger stronger i took her yesterday to see her primary doc and he was very impressed with how well she is doing i too have tolerated the chemo very well with minimal i think it is good that we post so others know it is definitely different for everyone right now i am just dealing with the nail beds being sore still no lifting coming off as for allergy symptoms they have been better ever since had the infusion nurse run the cytoxan slower so each round gotten better and better some sneezing and runny nose no more major dryness of the nose or blood i have noticed eyes tearing this round nothing major brittle when i went to see my reconstruction surgeon before surgery i went in asking about the diep i know i want the tram as i want muscle removed he was very honest in saying he specialize in the procedure and if what i wanted i would need to go else where where they specialize in this after looking at me he felt i be able to have the surgery any how as not enough fat for procedure he also mentioned he even like to do the tram as well as the outcomes are not great i have a few friends who have friends how went with the tram years ago and are not happy and have no strength in doing certain things due to muscle being gone they are also not happy with how they look backing you brittle on telling the ladies to do their research and if seriously moving towards this to be surein finding a dr who specializes in the procedure i wanted to let you know emailed with neli and i want to share with you there is always hope i checked with her to make sure she was okay with me telling you she received some news from her dr s in which she was told there was cancer found intwo internal mammory glands very suspicious nodes it was found when mapping for radiation through the ct scanvery close to the sternum pet scan was then performed you can imagine how devistating this news must have been she was put through another surgery but guess what low and behold they were all wrong her pathology report came back and there was no cancer ever give up hope on another note jason told me tues he feeling well and felt feverish he came home early so her i am praying not to get sick as well as for mom he stayed home yesterday and i made sure mom and i stayed out i refused to kiss him touch him etc lol i kept him sequestered i actually told him to book a hotel room lol knock on wood so far so good mom and i are doing well i just thought it waskind of funny sick and mom and i are holding strong he went to work today story i am over wearing scarves bandanas i actually prefer nothing when home wear nothing with this said had a couple deliveries to the house and i answer with nothing on my head when gone i then realize oh no lol surprisingly nothing has been said from the delivery people and no astonsihing looks when i answer the door to make me think oh my gosh hang in there ladies hugs bonniehope is faith holding out hand in the dark george iles oh no melinda so sorry you are feeling bad on day 3 hopefully it will pass very quickly good thing you called for just in case though i know if is hard to ask for help brendashar thanks for updating the smileys on the treatment times thoughts are with you for tomorrow andyep half way through the roughest part a c and i took off bracelet 4 yesterday after the tx thank you so much to all of you with the good wishes and happy thoughts and prayers for a good 2nd tx must have worked because day 1 all over again went fantastically well i had lunch afterwords with the friend who accompanied me my evening was fine did have to takesomecompazine at bedtime for a little nausea itake thatas soon asi feel even a littlenauseated because scared to death of letting it geta good hold today day 2 i feel great even walked my dog twice for the exercise am still drinking drinking drinking for the all the reasons brendashar mentioned i did find out something critical at the beginning of the tx thati been told if my white cell count hadbeen downwhen they checkedit right before the tx i could not have had the treatment should i have just figured that out on my own or should they have mentionedthat possibilityto me said it have been a big deal i would have just come in the next week maybe to her it however i had a friend take me there to stay with me so that would have been a waste for both of us it would have thrown off every tx after that and it would have totally ruined my day did add that it is extremely rare for the count to still be down after the 8 neupogen shots but that did not make me feel any better i really think they should have shared that info with me ahead of time re mouth sores with a c i am given crushed ice with the tx solely for the purpose of preventing the sores that cancome with the a and i even got one though not too bad on my tongue like a canker sore and it came on day 11 of the first tx nurse said that cold whether it is ice or just cold water closes off the capillaries in the mouth during the tx to prevent the a from getting to the surface made sense to me why do i feel like so much of this is a work in progress seems there is a lot of contradictory info being given out hope everyone else who had a tx yesterday is doing well today no doubt the are relieved to have it over happy thoughts and prayers for those going in today thursday orfriday i am getting my last dd taxol tomorrow i find the effects cumulative my fingers and toes are numb and very sensitive to hot and cold i get shooting pains down my legs and feel like i have weights on my legs bottom eyelashes are gone top on the way out oh and lets not forget the eyebrows slowly making a retreat i also find i am more tired as time goes on maybe its because i kept working and only missing treatment day and then some days i feel like i did not do myself any favors by pushing myself to work i should have done more days off and more days so here i sit today at work exhausted and hurting yes i got all the bone pain and muscle pain from the taxol and neulasta i just want to whine even though i know tomorrow is my last one i do not want to go through the se again i wanna cry i should be happy tomorrow is the last but again i just simply dread the next couple of weeks i know it gets better but it is still hard to face the inevitable so i tell myself to suck it up other people have it worse ok i think i am done whining its good to get it out i hope everyone has a better day today good thoughts to all of you in the coming days hi ladies one week post tx and feeling ok i had a little bit of nausea this weekend which was unusual for me after taxotere seems to have abated nail question i have had 3 rounds with no nail issues my fingernails are still fine although bitten and ragged as usual horrible habit but i just noticed an issue with a big toe the last few days it feels sore as if i am getting an ingrown nail i took off my nail polish last night and there is a bit of a brown spot where it is hurting could this be taxotere issues just wondering what i could expect with this pa i stop my period until probably after round 3 of a c no sign of its return thankfully yes yes it helps depression too on the effexor pattyk i had been on zoloft for years had to switch when i started tamoxifen because almost all the other besides effexor can interfere with tamox being absorbed it has worked wonderfully my hot flashes are tolerable my depression is i will tell you though that you should take the extended release version not the plain generic version because i started with generic that was not had stomach problems with it the effexor xr made all that vanish good luck am taking supplements now to help the red white counts starting to feel better glad to say i go for my mamm visit with my surgeon in the next few weeks ok someone needs to buy me a drink tonight i hada bad day i felt fine this morning and even worked out it was thehuge blow up i had with my psoffice today that has melivid basically i may not be able to get my exchange surgery until fall because booked up wtf when i hired him to be my surgeon no one said anything about having tissue expanders for 9 months when i asked him more than once including last week when i could have exchange surgery the answer was 6 weeks post chemo or 8 weeks after your last fill he did say his schedule was busy but no one said iwould have to wait sevearal additional months for him to have time to simply replace my tissue expander with an implant i am beyond mad i went off on the nurse the one i really like i finallytold her this i have been a trooper through all of this i get up at6 30am every morning and get my 4 year old off to school i work out daily even when i feel well i do my physical therapy faithfully i do everything anormal mom does for my family including cooking a full dinner everynight i complain about this i ask for help i have tried so hard to be strong and keep everything the way it was before cancer for my family and i have done that for months all i wanted fromyou was light at the end ofthe tunnel the light at theend of my tunnel was surgery so i could slam thedooronbc and have my life back you just took the light at the end of the tunnel from me i am devistated i just find it odd thatwhen i called them on jan 5th to schedule myblmx and they had to coordinate 2 surgeons the ps and the sug onc they were able to fit me in on jan 27th because i was a new patient and obviously that meant moremoney now that i am an existing patient you will make me wait unneccessarily for months because i am not a priority any more i am beyond livid i know what to do do i find a new surgeon the nurse is going to talk with him but i see much happening with that i plan on at least scheduling an appt with the ps to discuss this and my dissatisfaction right now they are scheduling for june for saline implant exchange and july for silicone implant exchanges but they give me a date until i have had 2 more fills and then see the doc which will take a month at least by then they will be booking for late summer fall is this bs or am i just crazy i have a job i have to get back to and they will mess up my std in addition i was trying to get all reconstruction done this year because i knew i would max out on out of pocket now it will go into next year and it will cost me even more money i am sorry i had to vent dh is out of town on business i am alone this week i have been crying all day we have to cancel our vacation we just planned with 4 other familes for august now since i am at their mercy i have to make those phone calls tomorrow this stinks min i sent you a pm hugs lilylady i am in detroit you want me to head to the ford hq with my people only 30 min from me suchcrap if there is

the media do you have a local reporter on the news that goes to bat for people we do here in detroit and they expose the bad stuff on behalf just an idea i just got done watching the movie the rainmaker a few nights ago up on steroids late night i have seen it before great movie with matt damon about exactly this th insurance company dening treatment for a cancer patient because they deny

pull up a barstool and hang with us cool chicks i will buy the first round what are ya having i am still here i read a lot on here post a lot i have finished my 12 taxol that i started in the end of may tomorrow i am in the chair for 1 of 4 dd ac worried about had diarrhea sore finger tips and toe tips with nails getting iffy but ultimately staying on so far a little neuropathy fatigue to beat the band at the end of my chemo week i had muscle tightness and soreness in my legs and i get winded way way too easily not to mention hair loss the thursday withdrawal from the steroid iv is the hardest for me emotionally i become a labile weepy whiny needy insecure mess i can feel it come over me wed night and feel it leave th night when i wake up th morning i look in the mirror at myself and feel old ugly and worthless every other morning when i wake up i look in the mirror and think wow not bad looking for a bald cancer fighter lol i have explained to my closest friends that i am needy and sad on this day that the nurses explained to me the steroids leaving my body and that if they can just give me a little extra attention via text and phone and understand this will pass it is very helpful most come through for me but i have worried that i am becoming a labile crybaby for real but not i am a stoic hard headed emotionally balanced person in real life i have lots of drugs for the ac nausea i have the claritin aleve combo for the neulasta pain i have asked the docs to not give me a break between the taxol and ac bc i just want the chemo portion of my trifecta to be over next stop is surgery i am doing chemo and then rads i am still here will be here on this board if there are any remaining women until sept 26 my last chemo i am so excited to start growing hair in 9 weeks yahoo edited to add the steroids are iv premed today sat in chair for ac boy that huge syringe of ruby red stuff is intimidating i forgot to get the antacids heartburn otc stuff so had to ask my to go out and pick it up for me as i woke from a nap with a fast moving reflux that made me dizzy i moved to sit up so fast lol i am so fortunate that while my bathrooms at my house are being redone this week my ex and his girlfriend are letting me stay all week until fri with them the kindness people have extended me along this path of hellfire has made the thankful that i was kind enough to them in the past that they feel i deserve their aid chrissy my not at all d husband lives in front of his computer he is either listening to music fullblast or on the ukulele underground and sometimes fb but he posts under the name not his own now is that weird or not anyway i lost contact here for a few mins was typing a response to you 3jays and the screen just went totally blank so of course lost it all and had to reboot sometimes i hate these machines but then think of how wonderful it is i can keep in contact with my friends all over the place even in europe and greece and australia oh i sent an email to the handsome israeli whom i posted pics of just to see how he is doing he wrote back dear beloved that was something else he had a sense of humor anyway he just returned from working in spain and is with his girlfriend the same one he had before older and a psychologist i think she was always telling him to grow up and son by her zohar and he said he has finally had a breakthrough and is happy to be where he is in life and he recommended a book for me to read which i will check out anyway what i was writing before the computer went black was to you 3jays and i was saying it is your children who are missing it i had a great mother she was always looking out for my best interest but i avoided my parents like the plague until i went to work in switzerland for 3 yrs and although it was a great experience and i got to travel all over it was my parents that i was really homesick for i got to be really good friends with my mother after i came back and will always cherish the time we had together i remember one time after we had done some crazy antic and were laughing i think it was when the highway patrolman had stopped and told us we were not allowed to cut the flowers we were gathering at the side of the road for one of her projects which she most likely never finished away and i told her that the only reason i would even want a child would be so i could have a good time with him her the way she and i did mama was 73 when she died of pneumonia complications brought on by her lymphoma a shame because she still had a lot of life left in her anyway hopefully your children will realize that they are missing out by not spending more time with you and allowing you to spend more time with the gs maybe it is denial on their part or maybe they just know how to deal with an illness they can do nothing about who knows people just all think the same way which is what makes us unique and the world so interesting i am thrilled several of you have shown an interest in uncle you have been there 3jays i thinkmo is anoverlooked state the wine i have not found to be very good but there are all sorts of wineries where you can go for tastings and outlets for walnut bowls and beautiful scenery and i just find it to be a charming vacation get away this past summer i checked out some little restaurants i read about in a magazine and they were wonderful places my cousins anduncle had never evenbeen to i have taken many friends out there with me and they all call him uncle bill he now lives in a retirement community butturned thehouse over to the boysand i am so happy they did decided to keep it only one actually lives in springfield the other two are hours away i am going to post some more pics after i get them out of the little laptop and into photobucket which seems to be the only way i can post on here the steroids are not exactly working like they usually do i did have lots of energy but found i was able to sleep if i tried and last night since they had worn off i went to bed at 8 something got up around 1 to let the dogs out and then slept until about so that was a lot of sleep for me however i have been eating like a pig even without the aid of steroids so the fact they made me really hungry is not a good thing i have just sort of been having a little party with food ever since i went to florida the beginning of nov and it stopped i mean whatever i wanted and was within reach i have been eating chocolate marshmallowsantas reesespeanut butter trees home madechex mix stromboli i am going to make more itwas so good whatever sounded good i would go for no more counting points and looking at fiber grams like i was doing on ww yesterday afternoon i was so hungry at the grocery store dreaming of all this comfort food like beans and cornbread mac and cheese more stromboli that i sure i could make it home without having to go through a drivethru for something to tie me over for the miles to the house this would not be such a big deal if it for the fact i am growing out of my clothes and i still have not figured out what i am going to wear to that wedding tonight something not too tight since i know they are going to have good food there tim is not going said he would prefer not to go so i said fine because actually i will have a better time without him so far so good with this gemzar which worries me since it seems if i have ses the chemo working i felt like crap on abraxane and it worked i do haveconstipation but can take pills for that i saw the ophthalmologist yesterday and he is sending me to a cataract specialist told me to get some readers or he could give me a new rx no longer need them at all for distance and he is just amazed at how fast the change happened i have gotten used to myself in glasses being off work is nice but i no longer know what day it is i am off again monday and then am taking off wed so i can see a vascular surgeon about my bad veins so it should be another messed up week slowly the house is shaping up and i have been getting some long put off errands done last night i was so tired when i went to bed i just let the dogs stay with me and most of the time i even get enough of the comforter to cover myself up but at least this way i knew where they were i think i will take my camera to bed with me if i do that again it was a cute picture with them in sort of a huddle glad you are on the mend chrissy and also so happy you got good reports amyjo and that you are going to hook up with sv when she is at duke and barb i know you are chomping at the bit to board that ship sv ginger everyone else who posts and even those of you who just read have a wonderful weekend i have not had time to check out my signs and all that stuff but i used to be capricorn and on the chinese calendar i was an ox they change that one because it is based on yr you are born right glad to see a chat room covering abraxane first infusion was aug 20 felt fine for two days and then wow day three was awful my joints and muscles ached and hurt for a day i read day 3 is bad nurse told me first five days are the hardest and she was right my med info sheet said achs and paint of joints etc can last 4 to 5 days mine fortunately were only real bad on day 3 funny thing though at noon today would be the end of five days i had two naps this morning and am now feeling almost normal except the neuropathy i am feeling in feet and hands i cant wait to feel good enough to get out of the house when i did not want to go out to dinner this weekend my husband knew i did not feel good hi all my breast surgeon wants me to talk to a radiation onc to consider rads i had nodes and mx with clear margins but evidently the margins were close 2mm onc says no and obviously ps would like me to not have rads i want rads however has anyone else started to feel anxious about the end of treatment now that at the halfway point 4 on wednesday i just have a little anxiety ok a lot of anxiety you all have heard me vent before i just know i suppose it hurt to talk to the guy regarding nails i am on taxotere and had any problems with them so far knock on wood or my head onc said i could continue to get my nails done maybe the acrylic has protected them from the sun my nail gal checks my nails and toe nails very carefully to see if they are turning black also i know that taxotere is suppose to cause neuropathy and i think i may have that a little no tingling but i type as well and a little fumbly with stuff know if its chemo brain or what but i also do puzzles as quickly as i used to i also find myself getting a little foggy while driving scary maybe foggy is the wrong word it is more of a nagging underlying distraction i am attributing it to anxiety i hope this goes away after treatment i asked onc at my first visit if chemo makes it more likely to get or dementia he said no but maybe he thought i would forget hahafinal note i totally caved in to my fatigue and hired a gal to help me decorate my tree she is coming this morning so by tonight i will be full on christmas i decorated the house yesterday but just get myself on the ladder for the 12 ft tree my balance just right i do a theme tree i have ornaments from my grandmother my mom and all of the ones collected over the years it is my favorite part of christmas to go through all of the ornaments and remember where they are from hard to give this job to someone else but i will be here to supervise shopping tip online shopping is our friend whenever you do this open a 2d window on your computer do a search of whatever website you are on for online coupon codes you can usually get a good discount and or free shipping talk to you all soon laura xtine i know if it is the tamoxifen that caused that bone pain in your back arm especially that fast sometimes i get stupid little pains in my leg when i lay on my left side i mean i can hardly move my knee it hurts so bad but when i turn over it is gone so who knows only the shadow knows and cs7777 congratulations tomorrow will be one year for me so when i gave up cancer and january will be one year for me on tamoxifen i think it gets easier right and the t pill is like a it will keep all of us isthisfor real you know that makes a lot of sense i also take a with my pill i think give that up for awhile i also heard that too much fish oil omega 3 will thin your blood they advise you to not take it if you are having surgery maybe the combination of the 2 is causing bruising does this make any sense yes sunshine let us know what your onco says i call those mystery spots because i cannot for the life of me figure out what i am doing to get these spots bruises cuts well other than falling into an escalator step a couple weeks ago man that gash was amazing my own fault too i thought just hop up a couple steps to hurry this thing along it caught my leg oh well i still have to baby that gnarly gash sounds like we can all help each other on here ha sure we need our docs but we need all the support we can get thanks everyone xoxoxoxo hey ladies thanks for the welcome back still raining here school is back no

hey sun just came out oh sorry it just went back in think go look for the bottle of kaluha i finished the vodka now where did i put that my first day changing to aromasin been on tamoxifen for nearly 3 years with 3 monthly lucerin shots today i had my first zoladex injection and will get them 4 weekly switched to aromasin crossing my fingers the side effects are kind with taxmox lucerin i already have stiff joints terrible hot flashes thinning hair weight gain all at age 43 maybe this new cocktail will be better for me thanks to all for your input on the it is a common se from the cytoxan gas pains i take prilosec daily for gerd so will be doubling up on my prilosec and adding whatever i can find that works for me if otc products dont work she sd we can try nexium nurse said it will likely continue thru next tx thankfully next week is last one for fec then on to new se with the taxotere in 3 weeks any suggestions for avoiding the taxotere issues are welcomed i remember reading about icing the nails during is it just during the infusion i am so thankful that i found this thread the support is immeasurable morning everyone boy we were all busy yesterday sun is out right now going up to 51 here in south elgin but i saw on the weather channel something about snow showers which of course i had heard for tomorrow but they said inches sigh rita your tub is in yay be sure and send us pics when it is all done calypso you got great news and with a 38 chance of it coming back without rads i personally would be running to the rad onc right for most of us rads was a big nothing just the everyday thing of it that i hated i had 38 zaps there are some like blackjack who have a tough time but there is no way to predict how our skin will hold up go the the radiation thread and start reading you will be encouraged i think i think what we were all trying to tell you is this you need to do what is right for you as well as what the experts tell you is right for you if you are so dead set against rads and and this is a big and can live with your decision should your cancer come back and i know you are sitting there saying but i have only a 38 of it coming back i have a 62 chance of it not even without rads then you will be ok without the rads now me in the beginning i did everything and anything i could to get out of having chemo but being her 2 rationally i have a choice so i whacked it hard with everything and anything i could get my hands on as when all way said and done i knew that i personally could not live with myself if it came back and i had not done everything i could the first time remember your prognosis is excellent and there are all lot of girls just from this thread alone who wish we had yours you have an excellent chance at a complete cure with lumpectomy and rads jmho tho honey you need to live with your decisions ask blackjack re her decision about tamoxifen we all wrestle with the karin i was fine after rads too except for a rash on my rib area under my breast and some soreness there i finished 2007 i find that my ribs or rather rib meat is a bit tender now and the breast tissue is tender and from what i understand this is almost the norm and in most cases goes away with time so there you are you can copy this post i have just proclaimed you normal laura you home have fun jackie i am so sorry your mouth problems have come back this is directly related to chemo correct i mean you have some infection allergy sinus problemor something just a thought rest up today and let dh take care of you nicki where are you everybody else hope you have a wonderful sunday check back later and see what everyone has been up to jane i had quite a cold myself for tx 2 i think it was as long as your chest is clear chemo will go on priz yeah you are done congrats well onco was apologetic that the first taxotere was sooo bad for me after discussing alot of stuff about the preservatives in taxotere to the shots ect i showed him my hands which look like they have chemical burns on them that he said was proof that the dosge of the taxotere was too much for me the plan is to lower the dosage next week change from neulasta to neupogen shots to see if the bone pain will be lessened and see how it goes if i still have trouble with the taxotere he said we would discontinue it and move on to a new drug i think he said abraxane for the last one he was still puzzled that the pain was so bad in the heel spur and even more puzzled that it stopped when the rest of the bone pain stopped i guess he cn talk about it in san antonio lol anyway i was glad to know i crazy and that he expect it he did say i would be more fatigued at this point because the effects were cumalitive but that the pain was not supposed to be like that so while i party going into next weeks tx i do feel better knowing that he is trying his best to avoid another fiasco like the last one hi smartie i too have had a cough for more than 6 weeks had 2 lots of antibiotics and moved i was also coughing phlegm up too i was sent for a chest x ray a week last thursday and heard anything yet so be anything serious fingers crossed i also sound like i am losing my voice and have a sore throat but i i must admit it had crossed my mind had the cancer spread i am at the hospital on wednesday for my next zoladex injection so i might ask the onc for his thoughts i am just sick of the headaches from all the coughing anyway take care angie xxxxxxxxxxxxxx hey ladies welcome kimmie i know a friend of a friend who was diagnosed with ibc in september of 06 and she is now cancer free so i know it can be beat she have the prior issues but i know she did chemo surgery then more chemo then rads i hope the ibc board can give you some good advice but here for moral support only been on this board for a couple weeks but i learned quickly that these are a bunch of wonderful women to all the taxol ladies good luck with your first round tami i go in for my 2nd taxol herceptin tomorrow but this week was the best felt in a long time the fuzziness and general malaise and fatigue i felt on ac was pretty much gone i was able to really get back into exercising again and everything i eat tastes good again hallelujah i was so tired of the metal mouth i get nuelasta but so far the immune system seems to be kicking along ok my son had a fever of 102 for three days straight but i mercifully have stayed in the clear sure that the effects will start to accumulate over time but so far taxol is way easier oh and i had blisters on my feet too for awhile too been trying to walk 30 minutes at least 5 times a week and was doing great with it until my 4th round of ac then my feet just started to hurt when i walked and it was like my calluses all of a sudden turned into blisters it finally went away after about ten days of me babying my feet with aloe and tea tree oil i wondered if it might have been an effect from the chemo and now after hearing all of your stories pretty sure it must have been i better get off to bed so well rested for tx tomorrow of course probably sleep through treatment from the benadryl so i could just as well stay up by the way that seems so strange that some treatment centers let you have visitors even if i sleep its awfully nice to have by dh there hugs to all deann linda i used a prescription for mouth sores but it was for treating them it is called caphosol it is ampules you mix then swish and spit i never had thrush but most use nystatin for that dd needed it when she had a tonsillectomy last summer for thrush from the antibiotics she was given for taste changes i just had to ride it out it usually improved right before the next treatment natch i also did not gargle with the salt baking soda water mixture but here is the recipe for anyone who wants it i did ice my mouth during taxotere for treatments after numerous mouth sores after treatment 1 and never had an issue again soda and salt mouth rinse teaspoon baking soda teaspoon salt 1 cup of warm watermix well until salt dissolves rinse your mouth gently being careful not to swallow the mixture follow this with a plain water rinse to clean out any remaining salt or soda lories definitely try the effexor it may work for you sorry to say that it work for me i had the profuse sweating on tamoxifen too i found it very embarrassing my onc switched me to aromasin and i had several ses with that 8 months into to that drug and i began having wicked wet hot flashes every 30 mins my onc took me off hormone treatment completely i was only weakly er pr positive so hoping it really doing me much good if you go back to an ai there was a study presented at the recent asco conference in san francisco that said high doses of vit d helped reduce joint pain ask your doctor about that shadow 2356 i had a bad time with chemo but once the tc was finished and i was just on h i felt better i also lost weight and just now have gained some back after a year from the tc you are not alone but do ask for meds to control this if they give you meds for diarrhea take imodium that is what they gave me but at a higher dose just go into a chemo being constipated you are better having diarrhea when you take tch than the other then when the diarrhea hits take the imodium until you can control it it is a balancing act for sure if you feel constipated but just have diarrhea take miralax a couple of days before chemo and after until the diarrhea starts and then stop taking it until you get the diarrhea under control again i did not take emend but i had ativan and another one that helped me i also took protonic for heartburn and when that work i took pepcid but he prescribed it double strength from over the counter if you can get emend i understand that is the best the steroids is hard on the stomach so take care of yourself and it seems it will never end but it will and you will be a lot better after a while i think we have all have some of your side effects and i know i had all of them but it is like having a baby you forget some of it after it is over keep coming here with your problems or your good times we might can help but by all means call your chemo nurses for problems too they are there for you or should be mine we there so i was happy knowing that be sure to get that liquid in you so you dehydrate i got that way 2 times and had to have extra iv fluid check your blood pressure because if you are getting dehydrated you will have really low blood pressure and feel like fainting so many side effects and many causes for each you will need to tell nurses everything you are going through because some have these problems carolyn jeanne i love the title of your post sorry that you had to join the group that was recently booted off the island of i am a member of that group as well i had fac for 6 months during my first in 2003 i came in and had my ativan etc and then had the f and the cytoxan after that i was hooked up to a fanny pack that fed into my central line which i had instead of a port the adria was infused slowly over 3 days to protect the heart nausea was a problem for me during the first two cycles what got it under control was decadron and zofran from cycles 3 to 6 i was barely nauseated the fatigue was manageable i took a nap every afternoon for about hours and slept about 8 hours per night the main problem for me was the mouth sores and the sore throat during the last two cycles this is a doable regimen good luck and hopefully we will both be leaving again soon for island mynew favorite vacation spot hi ladies i am new to this thread though i have been on this site awhile back on a different thread compared to most of you actually a veteran lol i had a lumpectomy in july 2008 i started my chemo in august 2008 and finishedtx in december 2008 started rads almost immediately about a week after chemo completion and finished my rads in february 2009 i am still getting herceptin tx once every three weeks that will go on until august almost there yay i am somewhat discouraged about my hair growth i started to lose my hair abouta week or two after my first chemo tx late august early september i went and had it cut ultra short not shaved though been wearing a wig since i started togrow peach fuzz white gray sometime in december i think around 3 weeks after chemo tx was completed to me it seems to be taking forever right now the back is doing good estimate it to be about 2 3 and fairly full but the front top and sides are sooooo thin and close to my head there is no volume at all probably only measures about 1 what we would call sideburns is also a not too bad length but above that and on the top is super thin and short i am really discouraged about it some say it will catch up with the back but i am just so upset that it is taking so long and i guess a big part of my problem is that i am vain wish i and yet i am sooooo sick of wearing the wig and now that the weather here in nj is beginning to be springlike i stand the thing on my head the second i walk in the house off it comes kathimdgd susan 13 i admireyou both i like what you said kathi that if no one likes it their problem and so right we went through hell with the cancer the surgery and allthe chemo rads should we be uncomfortable just to please others i just need the nerve to get out there and go topless i am proud of you maybe if i think hard enough about you galsdoing it you will be my inspiration i truly want to but i chicken out every time i think try my dh tells me to go for it he says do you think anyone cares or will think anything less of you he keeps telling me that i do not look as bad as i think i do does anyone know if it will thicken in time getting so impatient another thing does anyone know if it would be okay to color it or do you have to wait until it is a full fledged head of hair i would like to go back to my ash blonde that i had from clairol for years now before the beast entered in sorry ladies mean to go on and on like this really going to try and flip my wig thanks sisters i will keep thinking of your courage hugs to all maggie hi ladies thanks for all your comments it always helps knowing any thing we go thru is normal we are not the only one i did call the helpline on this site had a lovely chat with them they too explained it is quite normal still early days as only been on tamoxifen since feb also as i have chemo which sometimes stops periods it all new to my body i am much better today even feel ok to venture out i have an appointment tomorrow with my bc consultant so will be mentioning this to her i have read up about zoladex but as i have enough side effects with tamoxifen not sure if i want any more just one other thing i have been following other links re se of tamoxifen have been taken evening primrose oil glucosamine chondroitin cod liver oil my friend works in boots pharmacy has recommended a herbal remedy for flushes night sweats its called sepia tried to start today but open the pack so will wait for my hubby to come in hopefully it can help others suffering same thanks again for your comments susan add my own story to the rest 95 er pr after ac t the surgery found me with 8 positive nodes and extension i also had an inoperable positive node so there was no question that after radiation my onc wanted me on continued treatment i had my remaining ovary out during the mastectomy brca 2 so onc put me on ai i started on arimidex and had terrible insomnia brain fog vaginal desert and joint issues the pain in my hips and sacrum earned me a bone scan which was clear my onc was willing to supply me with all the sonata i wanted so i could get some sleep and i found the whole situation tolerable but barely had dequervains tendonitis in one wrist which responded well to a cortisone shot when i saw my onc next i told him i had had a problem with my wrist and he said was it dequervains and that it was a very common side effect about a year and a half later at my regular physical with my pcp two liver enzymes were well above normal range and he recommended that i stop taking the arimidex immediately we waited 30 days and tested again but they were even higher i talked it over with my onc who decided to put me on a 30 day rest then another blood test and back within normal range i switched to aromasin and another blood test after 60 days showed the same liver enzyme problem so no more for me i was relieved but of course worried about not being able to be on a drug to help manage my recurrence risk onc put me on tamoxifen i had immediate improvement in the insomnia brain fog vaginal dryness and joint issues but gained 20 pounds in the first 20 weeks the only other side effect i have after over two years is some increased gastric reflux for me it was a welcome now my gyno is trying to get me to battle the vaginal atrophy that i experienced on the with dilators see how that works out my sister took tamoxifen for 2 years followed by 3 years of aromasin and claimed not to have a single side effect the entire time so not a foregone conclusion that everyone will have issues if trying to decide what to do i suggest to go ahead and try them to see how your body handles them you can always stop if the side effects are intolerable for you i have stopped taking arimidex after having my cholesterol shoot to 280 i have always had perfect cholesterol scores my oncologist then mentioned that it arimidex could be putting me at a high risk for heart desease because of the cholesterol increases since being on it 2 yrs i have decided to stop this drug altogether i was 5 yrs on tamoxifen and did not have any problems on it i have also stopped drug caused such bone and joint pain for about a week after my monthly dosage that i figured i would watch my calcium intake and keep up with the vitamin d my hand pain is almost nonexistent now that i am off when the weather changes or is cold vaginal dryness and low libido were also a problem with arimidex i am looking into having my left breast tissue replaced with an implant and not having to worry about breast cancer again hopefully i had a rt mastectomy in 1999 and i am 60 yrs old imagine that my body is producing a heck of a lot of hormones anyway that need to be blocked i also have had a hysterectomy many yrs ago so no problem there i am happy to see that we women are questioning the side effects of these inhibitors hi everybody i had my first treatment today tch and it waspleasantly uneventful the facility was very nice and had all the comforts of home i love my onc and the nurses and staff are wonderful my father came with me and it was really nice having him there the only excitement if you can call it that was while i was getting the taxotere dad noticedthat my skin started looking pale especially on my arms hebrought it tothe attention but she seem too concerned by it i that pale just enough for a father to notice and i having any other symptoms i did notice later that my normal color returned after the taxotere stopped wierd but whatever the meds seem to be working well knock on wood the only symptom noticed so faris a sort of crampy achey feeling around my abdomen lower back legs it feels like i normally feel around the time my period would start but i had a period in nearly a year so not sure what to think just wanted to put something by you all i have been on arimidex for 4 years now and i understand after also have my ovaries removed that i would possibly get problems down below but over the past few weeks i have noticed a strange smell from my urine sounds strange but it is almost smelling of smoke i know that i now have vaginal atrophy and have had my urine tested some months ago for a uti nothing i just wondered if it could be linked with the long term use of arimidex as i do know that it affects the bladder i do drink a lot of water and green tea and sometimes i am up to go the loo about 2 4 times going to the loo is also worse when i am on a diet wierd has anyone else been affected this way after using the drug for a long period thank you x over here in oz we are given ice mits to put on but only for the hands the staff told me they were supplied by the taxotere company not sure if this was true i still had most of my nails break off half way down but i lose the whole nail they also said painting them black helps but i try it wearing gloves out in the sun was also another suggestion my toe nails were fine and affected sue lumpectomy in dec 08 no chemo recommended thank goodness started tamoxifen a little over a month ago just completed day 10 of 28 rads my goal is to get me menopausal so i can take femara arimidex because she states that it provides the best protection 46 i figured that go into natural menopause pretty soon heard that surgical menopause is instant and wicked thanks for the reply sandy traci i had taxol the first time i was diagnosed and did get some nails turning dark i am now on taxotere having had 2 treatments and so far i had any nail darkening i am almost 3 years on tamoxifen had ses for sure but nothing i manage one way or the other for my muscle joint pain which is my worst se i exercise swim practice yoga take turmeric ginger and magnesium and manage to keep my pain level around 1 or 2 just depending on the day i hate to think 7 more years but then again it is doable for me i think the surgeries were much worse i did have problems with nausea and dizziness for the last year and a half and at one point truly thought i might not make the full 10 years but then i decided i needed to do something as opposed to most of my docs who just said welcome to menopause and found that i had a low grade chronic sinus infection i have the usual symptoms of allergies like sneezing runny eyes etc just nausea and dizziness once i did a course of antibiotics specifically clindamycin after having no relief with ceflex i feel awesome like the old me i still have some issues i am in menopause now since my jan hysterectomy and experience all that menopause has to offer like hot flashes and yes very mild and intermittent nausea buzzing in my head sometimes weight issues mental fog etc all symptoms of menopause and tamoxifen but i figure if i can fight through bc i can fight through my ses from tamoxifen i know some experience way worse issues than me but i do think worth seeing if you experience any at all you never know if be one of the lucky ones who said through it my bs said i should try to avoid the ais as long as i can exactly because i am doing pretty well on the tamoxifen he said overall the ai ses are worse ashley you are on herceptin i see that you are her 2 negative i felt so tired for 3 days after 1st herceptin my vertigo comes and goes i now wonder if it is from herceptin not taxol when i first started taxol herceptin back in may sissydi there should be a section for targeted therapy thread because it is not chemo or radiation right i wonder if taking b6 helped me having no pains during taxol did you guys tried that or maybe my anti anxiety med effexor for over 7 years helped that as well for new comers taxol is a breeze compared to nasty ac meeting radiologist tomorrow at 30am wait and nervous hugs robo this is for you sexyjoan have fun i know you willmahomet i take my anastrozole generic arimidex in the morning i do get stiffness but i also walk every day it helps nothing i live with so far my hair shedding but i did have hair receding before bc so i might not be a good person to go by hi fab feb gals last ec done on thursday one on to the 4 dd taxols halfway there more nausea immediately after this session nurse had me take a compazine for the ride home which helped a lot not too bad yesterday heavy napping but got to grocery store today same needed a compazine but only after car ride to pick up ds from airport he is home for his spring break napping still extremely important ladies sorry to say i got my period after every session the first 2 were extremely heavy this last not as bad maybe my body is finally getting the chemopause memo i had stopped for 6 months i am 52 and got a period just before the first session so am done with the every 2 weeks thing the gaila scarves are lovely i just have to make sure i tie too tight when i am in headache mode or it feels the same as the wig taste buds not too great but need to eat every few hours i have lost weight kind of hoping they will start off but not counting on it when the tastebeds fire up again hope all are well jean good morning ladies as i read through all the posts this morning i was so touched are an amazing group and i feel so happy to be a part of this thread herceptin went well yesterday but my labs all dropped from last week wbc was half of last week it upset me cause i really thought that if it was going to drop it would have done so last week not 14 days out anyway trying to eat iron rich and protein this week chemo is scheduled next wednesday my hair is still growing and i still have a full head not sure for now much longer though bandwoman 1234 i hope you find peace for decisions with your mom we built a house a few years back and both of my parents live with us i am only child i have a half brother in florida and my parents are 74 and 90 my dad had been married before and is 16 years older than my mom challenging havin them in the house but ok they are relatively healthy given ages my mom has heart issues and she had cancer twice never chemo hers was treatable with surgery and radiation i was concerned about them aging illness and so forth and how they would be taken care of so this is what we did the medicare system and the cuts and all of that i know that they could afford to live on their own my dad has and i know how much longer he will be able to live here so far he has not wandered off and he still knows us spiritblessing your bible study sound interesting i am adding to our list of choices surrender is not one of my strong points and the lord is definitely working on me with that and several other areas like yesterday when i found out my labs had dropped i immediately got on line and started looking up dietary changes to improve issues instead of going to him in prayer that should have been first but he pointed that out to me i am learning and thankfully he is so willing and patient to show me tobycc loved the picture i hope your strength again congratulations on your report and i as stated earlier god is always teaching me and thankfully he does it lovingly ladyb 1234 i hope the right decision is made regarding the tamoxifenzjrosenthal i do hope your joint pain improves and that your husband can find some peace please take care of yourself as emotional issues are as draining and take a toll just like physical pain hope everyone has a wonderful day my dr at md anderson suggested that i start my treatment with the taxol first then the ac it seems like all of you did the opposite it kinda scares me reading all of your posts about how bad ac was seeing how i will start it in april with the taxol i have had no ses other than my hair thinning alot i am so happy for all of you who are close to finishing your treatment stacyrose i am in the same boat i currently take both tamoxifen and do the ovarian suppression zoladex the hot flashes are no fun but other than that the side effects i believe are minimal for me i am 39 and still debating on ovary removal i figure i will eventually do it but wanted to avoid another surgery so soon my mo did say i would be on the zoladex for at least ten year along side the tamox and ai even then i might not still be in natural menopause hence opting for the ovary removal i am on weekly taxols and after my 8th my haemoglobin has dropped to my mo said that typically they do transfusion if it falls below 8 but said i need it right now so i go in monday for blood work also wbc counts are low and i had to take 3 neupogen shots this week my taxol number 9 on friday was cancelled after two neupogen shots my counts go above 1 so they will see my counts on monday after i had the third shot on friday i have been eating iron rich foods even had a steak but i feel so fatigued and have been on the couch all day i have a feeling that my haemoglobin will be lower as i am still so tired i was wondering how many ladies have had a transfusion what was your experience getting a transfusion makes me nervous do you feel better after a transfusion did you need transfusions going further i did fine with 8 taxols i have 4 more to go and i feel so bad i feel stressed about how i will finish i feel discouraged please any input would be greatly appreciated septmom been on zometa for 2 years now monthly i v around minutes the day after my first injection i was tired and sore but after stage iv diagnosis i have taken arimidex daily arimidex causes rheumatoid arthritis for me the soreness after the first couple of zometa injections was comparable to a bad day with arimidex i occasionally every few weeks or so have a bad day where i wake up sore and the rest of the day seem to shake the arthritic soreness in my joints mostly knees and elbows for me i do yoga like stretches in bed before i get up and on bad days those streches just take longer i am a former athlete now in my mid 40 s and the most i do for exercise these days is walk my dogs i have always blamed my bad knees on my basketball days so for me the arthritis from arimidex or the soreness from zometa is like a bad knee day i have to allow more time for getting ready for my day and i move slower now my zometa injections affect me at all twice the next day i felt like i had been run over by a truck but i was coming down with a cold benefits for me with mets to my spine and pelvic bone far outweigh the negatives not on tamoxifen but on femara i have had some of the same side effects weight gain joint pain since taking glucosamine i have next to no joint pain did you have the oncotype test done if so what was your score and risk of recurrence i think that should have a bigger factor in your decision my score was only 7 with a 14 recurrence if i take the femara i was willing to take and do whatever i needed to to keep this bitch at bay she already pissed me off once and not willing to dance with her a second time thank you so much for all this information i was so ignorant of the side effects regarding any or all these solutions injected swallowed infused eaten etc unbelievable and i always asked always always went home thinking ask me no questions tell you no lies and i asked but they only told me everything was safe even after i was so sick from one of the contrast dyes and called the doctors after 8 pm they made me feel like a hypochondriac moronic fool contrast dye when i asked about dangers and side effects i was told so what you already have cancer anyway almost two years later and that comment continues to haunt and annoy well it was the radioactive dye inducer node and he was the ickiest ick still his attitude and comment rang a little subconcious bell when i asked the same question before other testing procedural dye injections i was always told it would wash away minisculte amounts of radiation harm the body and mammograms are perfectly safe i know do you sometimes i think the mammograms caused the cancer in the first place but i can also think of a billion other toxic moments and carcenogenic chemicals water air etc yikes as a brownie and a girlscout i used to stand behind the bus and enjoy the odor ahhhhhhhh so who knows dying to know lol indioh forgot why i responded to this post every time i had dye contrasts return home feel flu like symptoms short of breathing itching a slight rash and headache and usually resulted in vomiting and muscle pains when i mentioned it to the techs rads docs surgeon chemo docs they all said the contrast dyes were harmless and i was likely reacting to stress anxiety or really a virus or illness now i am reading these unbelievable comments and i have no idea as to whether or not i am allergic to iodine etc it is amazing that we are not told of the possibility and or probability in which such a reaction may occur i am with lots of allergies and had to take triple doses of decadron when a rash covered my body during the taxol treatments as well as cramping head throat stomach and body spasms as a triple negative i was told it was the only hopeful drug and received 12 weekly treatments i was not offered the new taxol which contain pinesol cleaning solution lol chemobrain is bad lately nat paeagles for what worth i had swollen hands all through ac and finally let up my rings that are normally nearly falling off were too tight to wear and my usually mild carpal tunnel symptoms got aggravated it got even worse when i was chugging gatorade all day long if had surgery already sure i would have been assuming it was le well relieved the taxol is going ok so far had a tiny bit of leg bone pain and some tingles in my hands and feet but nothing major yet the biggest pleasant surprise was being able to drive the day after and zero nausea still napping a lot though my hot flashes actually seem improved but not sure if a coincidence a few degrees cooler in the house than it has been last night i took a xanax before bed and actually slept through the night so used to waking hours before dawn i was confused when i woke up to light for a minute i thought i was waking from a daytime nap wishing a pleasant weekend to everyone dear bbk while reading your posting it was just like reading about myself i had to have a hysterectomy because of the tamoxifen and the side effects are a real pain and i do mean pain lots of muscle and joint pain in the legs and tingling in the arm and hands i also have bad mood swings and have put off going to the doctor because i dont want to have to take more drugs just started counseling and going to talk to doctor because it seems to be getting worse some have no problems with the tamoxifen but everyone is different to in how their body reacts do what you feel is right for you good luck lori good evening girls mani on since yesterday pm and it took me forever to read through all i missed be away this weekend at my to check in on him gonna missyou all and will try to find computer access or take me eternity to catch up on sunday night today i picked up my wigs i still like them thank god hope they look as fab when bald it was also the so he had the day off we sent the rugrats to preschool all day and just hung out went to lunch got ready to go away tomorrow to see dad went and looked as harleys funny story there first off i am anything but a biker babe more the quiet minivan type but i guess i do have a wild streak anyway we used to joke that when we turned 40 get a boob job i never really thought do it justsaid it for hisbenefit and get his harley he used to have a bike before we were married but he sold it to buy me my engagement ring which is beautiful if i must say so so along comes bc this year and 36 i get my boob job thank you mastectomy not the way i had wanted to get boobs and he still has no harley and he really wanted this much more than i wanted boobs maybe cave in if all goes well this next year and he can get one a year early and now thinking i might get some leather pants and i bustier to show off the new rack hahaha ok quick hellos and then gotta get the kids to bed and finish packing d1 got sista 2 on the list man we are a huge group thank god 2 of us to keep it straight once kicks in hopefully have 1 full brain right also do you think your itchy hands are a neuropathy i know the taxanes can cause weird peripheral sensations just wondering lj13 keep us posted on the her 2 status there are 3 of us already one who are positive herceptin will be added to your regimen for a year if you are also glad to hear 2 went well for you this week wvgirl i agree with sis kimberly on the job situation danac yet another example of someone who had surgery and then chemo much later my lumpectomy was at the end of august and my mastectomy was oct 5 chemo starts next week for me many have already commented on the brca test so add just say that you darn well should qualify and insurance should cover try going trhough a genetic counselor if you have access it helps with insurance coverage as for clinicals it really will depend on your energy level but also consider what type of patients be around you want to catch anything from them carolc we start chemo the same day you definitely were right to insist on getting info beforehand i believe they thought they could tell you the day of nervous as the day gets nearer how about you even despite everything read here totally paranoid about what ses have and if prepared enough for them wish i could have my own nurse right here carol golfer all hail emla glad it worked i can use it on round 2 but not one still gonna act dumb and ask my onc the day beforehand about it sista 2 doing cytoxan taxotere herceptin is carboplatin the same as cytoxan i think it is otherwise we are very similar gotta run kathy hi lynn 1 so sorry that i respond sooner been out of the loop for the past week i threw my back out while exercising believe it or not i was doing one of my old the firm tapes and get my big bootie to stand straight suffered for several days and am just starting to stand upright again been on the fareston for about a week started jan 6 2011 my oncologist has me on a 3 week trial to see if i can tolerate it tamoxifen was a monster drug for me the hot flashes using been so bad but been dealing with fatigue insomnia constipation and my appetite has decreased a bit i noticed the appetite suppression at about day 5 i mean i feel as ravenous when i wake up and now i find myself going longer w o eating i read that anorexia could be a side effect but far from skinny 5ft 8 and weigh in at 193 lbs like to lose at least 30 lbs but having a hard time i still have bone pain and neuropathyas a residual effect from chemo and remained for the past year i was part of a research study using ixempra on women with lower grade breast cancer and unfortunately those side effects worn off like you thinking a little too soon to weigh in on the drug the expense is bad enough and if the side effects show up later with similarities to tamoxifen then i just might return to it irina 777 i am heading into 6 and final round of cytoxan taxotere this coming tuesday i started taking the neulasta shot after my 3rd round because i developed a high spikey fever chills signs of infection 10 days after my 2nd round i take a regular 24 hour claritin the morning that i receive my afternoon shot of neulasta that has helped prevent the bone pain from the neulasta shot i continue to take the claritin for at least 7 more days there is an ongoing clinical trial aboutclaritin preventing the bone pain associated with the neulasta also one of the side effects of taxotere is muscle and bone pain see for more info on the taxotere website was founded by scott hamilton former olympic ice skater and cancer survivor and seems to have little more info about the chemo drugs here is the link also read that you can take one tylenol plus one motrin combo every hours to help with the pain just make sure before you take any otc meds that you check with your onco to make sure you can take them good luck looks like taxol is working for me according to my ct scan phew it is a relief not to burn thru treatments too quickly apparently the lung mets have shrunk a little bone is more sclerotic therefore healing i just wish i felt more comfortable maybe that will come soon i still have a bit of a pleural effusion but greatly improved following the pleurodesis the discomfort i feel is mainly my lungs i have pleural mets as well as nodules inside the lungs wrsmith i call my discomfort pain just a feeling that all is not right but never requiring pain relief the worst part of taxol for me is fatigue great eyebrow tattoos by the way texasrose hi im taking latrozole and feeling sick headaches and horrid i havnt been given any calcium tablets yet i start my radio therapy today for 3wks but im thinking if getting some vitamin d for my bones and ive also started having lots of natural yogart with fresh fruit im trying to make sure im getting my calcium this way as i dont really have much milk hope this helps your so lucky not having any se from latrozole but im gonna carry on taking them and see if the sickness fizzles out xx i have tried them all i first started on tamoxifen and was on that for about a year until i had a blood clot and thickening of my uterine wall and bleeding that my gynocologist and medical oncologist said i needed to stop the tamoxifen and required an immediate oopherectomy after that surgery i was put on arimidex and started having severe joint pain i was on that for about a year i was then switched to aromasin and the severe joint pain continued last october i was changed to femara and still had the severe joint pain i have been given different other drugs to deal with the pain which is worst in my knees i have not been able to ride my horses since april 2013 due to the pain mounting riding and dismounting and that was with using a step ladder to get up and down yesterday i saw my mo and told him that i think the celebrex was helping at all with the pain and he told me after 4 years of taking all of these drugs that i need to come off of them so today is my first day not taking any of the tamoxifen or ais lisag 61 i tried desperately to make the 5 years but i could not i do not know how bad your ses are but i was willing to put up with a lot of them except the severe joint pain and quite honestly i thought i was going to have to keep limping for another 11 months to make it to the 5 years you can still try femara and see if you do any better with it why thank you girls for posting your comments ai exhaustion is a new one on me but now i get it exercise is a good antidote acceptance is too i thought it was just me can also cause depression or am i depressed because i am always so tired and feel completely useless my vitality has been zapped as for why i got mets to the bone with no node involvement ask me i know it may be because i refused chemo and had only rads i also refused at that time in 2001 i done the tamoxifen but was working and deal with the constant hotflashing how many gals are still working why necessity what are your thoughts on trying to maintain a work schedule when going through treatments why do we do this to ourselves unless its absolutely necessary why we give ourselves a break how many women think working f t is good for us i have cut my hours way back because i just have that stamina imagine 40 hours a week me too on letrozole for about 9 months now stiff and painful joints the whole time am trying acupuncture now but its not making any significant difference yet but still hopeful but have to say after reading the lancet study which says having this kind of side effect is linked to lower rates of recurrence then i think be more worried if i getting these side effects makes it a bit more bearable to me anyway give the brocolli thing some thought as already upped my spinach intake in the hope of counteracting the few glasses of wine i have occasionally s new 2bc i was on the mylan manufacturer of tamoxifen citrate i had all the listed side effects increased hot flashes vaginal discharge fatigue bone pain as you read i have an acute hearing loss and constant tinnitus in my left ear guess this side effect is very rare as my medical oncologist does not believe it is related to tamoxifen usage i was 60 years old when i started tamoxifen so i was already post menapausal x 1 year my neurologist otolaryngologist did listen and believes itcould bea possible theory that the sudden hearing loss is due to the tamoxifen good luck to you discuss all possible side effects with your oncologist those of us who underwent radiation therapyvia a mammosite are also asked to go on tamoxifen it is scary to read about all the side effects i know that many women experience hot flashes and night sweats and are looking for relifef well i just read about a study which will make you happier i quote hot flashes or night sweats from taking a serm selective estrogen receptor modulators can be troubling but a 2008 british study suggests that women who experienced hot flashes and night sweats while taking hormonal therapy medicine were less likely to have the breast cancer come back recur knowing that this side effect might indicate a reduced risk of the cancer coming back may help some women stick with treatment despite the side effects as a benefit serms also can improve bonedensity which reduces the risk of osteoporosis so you can go to to find out more about this wishing everyone peace nana mommato i started and continue on letrozole femara generic is 10 for 30 day supply not had any real issues with it i take it at bedtime to reduce the impact of any fatigue wooziness etc for those having issues with hot flashes read that magnesium

luck to all of you finished rads in mid february after completing 6 dense dose chemo treatments started taking tamoxifen 17th march and side effects from that drug include hot flashes joint pain sleeplessness fatigue naudea headaches moodiness still have some stabbing pain in radiated breast that comes on strong and leaves quickly very low energy level but trying to stay up and get stronger and heal as best i can what a year this has been take good care and just breathe teklya headeast congratualtions on going back to work schoolcounselor so sorry to hear your back pain is getting worse hopefully your mo will come up with a plan to figure it out soon gram on taxol and have some bone pain but i also get a neulasta shot so not sure which one causes it hey lg nice to see you welcome goosie today was dd taxol 3 out of 4 it was a long day since i met with the ot regarding lymphedema prevention at and then went for my infusion out at i actually took a couple of cat naps done that before guess the benedryl got to me or maybe i was just tired i also felt some nausea at the end and decided to take a compazine just waiting for the rest of the side effects to show up in a couple of days and then i will be eagerly waiting for them to disappear again i will get 5 fu maybe that stands for cancer lol plus herceptin ac taxol first go around the ac definitely was the make me sick and hair fall out stuff hi chickpea beaner i had tax but i think the side effects can be similar to fec some people dont have very bad side effects some do everyone is different your hair loss that is a hard one coming to terms with that can be very difficult and i know you probably wont want to really hear this but if you are able to get a good wig there are hundreds of fabulous ones out there people really will not be able to tell the difference i had loads of people coming up to me and asking me who had coloured and cut my hair because it looked fantastic it was my wig you will have to see how you are physically but you sound pretty much as if you have already made your mind up that you are not prepared to let this son of a bitch stop you from going ahead with your wedding as planned i am sure there will be more ladies commenting and giving you advice but fair play to you and i hope everything goes your way keep posting and let us know how you get on and all the very best for your wedding day love liz xxxx been on anastrozole for about 16 months now and my hair is really thinning when it returned after chemo it was so thick i loved it now its falling out and turning thinner sad but i guess all these side effects mean the meds are working my eyes started watering on my first treatment aromasin more than 4 years ago i ended up with few eye infections and took an eye doctor a while to figure out that the dry eyes were the reason i am on restasis prescription eye drops plus refresh celluvisc preservative free in sterile vials abraxane was the worst for my eyes but every chemo causes some eye watering maybe try refresh celluvisc cheapest at costco krystyna bone and liver mets since october 2009 hey tamoxifen pals can anyone comment on moodiness depression as tamoxifen ses i started taking it in and apart from some joint pain nightmares and fatigue i was doing okay until a week or two ago this past week had more bad days than good weepy hopeless frighteningly angry and extremely overwhelmed finding it very difficult to function have you had mood issues on tamoxifen if so did you find that anything helped seeing a naturopath once a month i exercise 6 days a week and i try to eat well and get enough rest if you gave up tamoxifen due to mood problems or depression how long did you wait after these ses appeared the other day i calmed myself only by thinking give this drug another week and scrap it if i feel more like myself but logically i know that might not be sufficient time also not sure that i can blame tamoxifen completely as i am still getting my period and have historically been quite emotional at certain points in my cycle though not to this extent thanks for any info or even commiseration cathey i was having the same issue on femara not only back spasms but terrible leg and foot cramps and other muscle spasm cramps i posted here about it and several ladies suggested that my workout program was too heavily skewed towards aerobics i use an elliptical they suggested that i incorporate more weight training pilates and yoga type exercises into my workout program at the time i was having the issues i calculated that my workout program was about aerobics and i was only spending about 20 of my time doing other stuff since shifted the ratio and now do about 60 aerobics and about 40 weight training pilates and yoga that was about a month ago and really helped a lot adding in more weight training yoga and pilates it was very hard holding the yoga poses especially at first as my back ab and leg muscles would cramp but combined with the weight training and the pilates the spasms and cramps have gotten a lot better i just use the basic wii fit yoga program and i do a quick 20 minute pilates program i downloaded from fit tv i use very light weights from 3 pounds up to 5 pounds depending on the exercise as i have stage 1 le and am doing a weights program designed by my le therapist but doing those things more consistently has really helped ease the muscle spasms and cramps good luck hi debra glad to hear that the injection went smoothly and that you are not in too much discomfort i am on aromasin and zometa and i wonder what the difference is between falsodex and aromasin is anyway i had several months of discomfort from the bone mets that i have and then they started to go away the soreness and pain were pretty intense right before the pain lessened i am also thinking that the mets hurt more as they are healing i know if you are also taking lupron but i found that this medication made the bone pain seem so much worse i am optimistic that for you the bone pain is caused by the healing process or is a temporary reaction to the meds you are on i found aleve worked well to help with the pain when it was really bad i took norco i wish you increased comfort and continued good reactions to your current meds take good care joani i did a bump on our tac march april 2006 thread there were a bunch of us and we were pretty chatty and so you can get various perspectives on tac from the thread i started 23 march 2006 and finished with 6 treatments every 3 weeks in july 2006 lost my hair just before the second treatment wore a wig to work only stopped wearing it all together about 6 weeks after chemo ended while doing radiation had a little hair by the 12th of october i know because my husband and i celebrated our 100th birthday that day enough by christmas that i just looked like i had a very very short cut my eyebrows took a long long time to come back and now they are still much more sparse than they were before i was pretty lucky with side effects had the treatment on thursday neulasta on friday spent a lost weekend feeling lousy and then climbed back to feeling well enough to travel florida to dc for work by tuesday did that each of the 6 times doing well feeling well now have mammogram once a year alternating with mri once a year i had ilc with positive nodes found by the initial mri see my breast surgeon once a year and see my oncologist about 3 times a year on femara as chemo put me into permanent menopause i turned 50 in 2006 thinking good thoughts for you all leigh the visual for sherrry well said as for the neuropathy it can take a long time to go completely and in some cases years from my chemo that ended last jan the neuropathy continued to get worse for a few months and i still had it when i started taxol so now of course it is worse the leg pain could be left over from chemo or according to the prescribing info i found on it could be from the herceptin there is a thread about peoples experiences with herceptin on the forum for those with her 2 bc for the info on your experiences with rads tomorrow is my simulation hi to all my sisters everyone seems to be moving along here in the world of chemo i have a major issue a big surprise lately i went for my 2 tc yesterday my mo is in turkey giving a lecture and will not return for 3 weeks i met with his pa i indicated all the having with tc really the ones that bothered me the most is the weakness severe fatigue and the bladder irritation from the cytoxan which i did get a uti she suggested the following options and will email these options to my mo so he can okay it or have some type of input the pa went over it with another mo in the office but she never came in to talk to me i have to make this decision this coming tuesday because i cannot skip another treatment here are the options 1 stay on tc every third week i have three more and they will reduce the dose by 20 and hope that cuts down the weakness severe fatigue i have no idea what they would give me for the prevention of bladder irritation 2 go on taxol which does not carry the weakness fatigue but does have the se of dizziness i would do this once a week for 9 weeks starting tuesday in addition taxol carries more of a risk of neuropthy than taxotere also i would not have to do the nuelasta shot because they would be once a week in which my counts would be monitored obviously all of us would not find either option appealing if i go the route of taxol i think i can switch back to taxotere so frustrated and anxious i know when my mo will email the pa about his thoughts help interesting how many times patients report and are told that what they are experiencing really happening or is due to something else why they just say yes it does do that but something have to live with however my absolute weight seem to have changed but the distribution has i have a huge roll of flab round my middle which i have before and which is really uncomfortable i met a colleague recently who i seen for ages and who know been ill and she commented on it so most certainly not my imagination what worried me more is that i also became extremely depressed on tamox yes maybe just depressed because of having cancer everything gone through etc etc but of all the the hardest to deal with because it affects my ability to cope not to mention to be motivated to exercise eat right etc presumably if having a natural menopause all these things happen more gradually so not such a shock to the system i was on tamoxifen for 4 years with massive side effects including fatigue my onc finally lowered me to 10 mg saying that the 20 mg dose was suggested by the drug company even with that i was sleeping alot for the cramping i found that using 400 mg of magnesium controlled it if i stopped taking it even for a day it was back i am glad i found this thread because i have been on arimidex for two months and am miserable i took my last pill this morning i intend to take arimidex again gone from an energetic active 54 year old to a woman who can hardly move in the morning and has no energy to do anything a tough problem with 8 year old twins i constantly have a headache i am not a complainer and have been through bmx chemo and radiation with a diep scheduled on october 10th none of that was easy but each had a foreseeable endpoint well short of five or ten years i can deal with the hot flashes and the weight gain but not the overall crushing effect on quality of life i am drinking every green drink protein drink eating very little gluten etc to try to forestall the effects but nothing is working looking for a recommendation for a medical oncologist in northern virginia preferably in the leesburg area i did a quick search and found 10 but need to select one from the group and would prefer a recommendation likely switch to tamoxifen but also need to switch oncologists as part of that process if you are one of those many women who experience arimidex side effects be thankful crossing my fingers that tamoxifen will be kinder to me i am catching up on posts here it seems like alot of people are having problems with herceptin the cardiomyopathy this scares me i currently have 8 left the incidence of cardiomyopathy is about percent however if you combine it with adrimycin cytoxan that risk increases significantly i had echo after herceptin number 7 and my ef remains at 60 percent i will have another in december i am a cardiac nurse so cardiomyopathy is very scary to me i am trying to get back into exercising i have been to pilates yoga now for a couple weeks i believe that just that little has helped me with range of motion all over my body the first time i went i hardly bend over i believe at 44 how that chemo still beat me up glad it is behind me i still have knee pain i know if it chemo related herceptin tamoxifen or if i hurt my knee i sat on the couch yesterday with an ice pack on it knitting a scarf i must say the ice really helped it hair is growing back black and gray i colored it blonde before chemo however everyone says it looks nice so i may just let it grow like this for awhile i am just so darn happy to have hair for those suffering from peripheral neuropathy from chemo my cancer center is participating in research that shows cymbalta helps with that that may help kill 2 birds with one stone cymbalta helps with pain depression and neuropathy does anyone have any idea how long it takes for the swelling in your breast to go down after radiation i completed radiation 3 weeks ago i had lumpectomy in feb i saw my surgeon 2 weeks ago and i have a seroma it is pretty big she want to drain just yet because to close to completing radiation will address in jan my affected breast is about a d cup and my other is a c cup i think it is still just inflammed my mo said i have an internal sun burn i find a bra that fits to save my life i am wearing a amoena hanna for now or just some generic sports bras suggestions i also found just the small amount of exercise i have been doing has taken my heart rate down i was running a couple weeks ago since i started exercising again it is down during chemo i had resting heart rates around 100 all the time mary well said i was a loopy loo nut case before i even got sfbc and to be honest tamoxifen has made my life easier as far as loopy looness goes had a bumpy start but all is good now the lice saga the other day just reminds me that i have hardly any bad side fx from this pill even being an extensive metaboliser and when something goes wrong it is easy to point the finger i used to point it at my dh but it is easier now to blame sfbc i also hardly ever used to have a piece of cake when i was out with my friends but now i usually do not because i crave it but because i damn well deserve it and ahh yes the ageing process just being told you have sfbc ages you 10 years i reckon 47and sure i am supposed to be looking a little scaryregardless of tamoxifen i have also noticed with all my stop starting exercise and being restricted for so many weeks month after month the less exercise i do the more aches pains and whinges i have it isso important to stimulate the brain but also to stimulate your joints and muscles easier said than done i know been there alien gestation hehehehehe and mary speaking of aliens how freaky is that i now have one fingernail with a ridge maybe it will light up and i will have to phone home fipples are ok going topless around the house to let them get some air at the moment sorry tmi and i have made a tentative date for myreplay on my exchange surgery to get rid of the squeak for december meeerrryyy xmmmmasss i did 4dd ac then 4dd taxol and then 14 herceptin the taxol was a breeze compared to ac i did have bone pain but no numbness my fingernails got real wavy and dark and so did my toenails i was never sick at all with taxol be happy on the homestreach best of luck may god bless sue acupuncture i found the article below on but i have been reading other places about the efficacy of acupuncture for hot flashes night sweats libido issues as well as specifically for tamoxifena new study has found that traditional acupuncture can help relieve the adverse side effects of the commonly used drug tamoxifen fifty participants with early breast cancer completed eight traditional acupuncture treatments eligible women had been taking tamoxifen for at least six months and reporting at least four incidents of hot flashes and night sweats per 24 hours for at least three months acupuncture reduced the frequency of these unpleasant side effects by half percent in 30 weeks when the experiment ended there were beneficial effects as late as 18 weeks after the end of treatment the women also experienced improvement in fear and anxiety loss of memory and concentration menstrual problems sexual behavior sleep problems etc dr beverly devalois and her colleagues in middlesex uk concluded that these results compared favorably with other studies on relieving the side effects of tamoxifen the women enjoyed improved physical and emotional they called for further valois ba young te robinson n mccourt c maher ej using traditional acupuncture for breast hot flashes and night sweats j altern complement med 2010 16 10 cheryl and margo been getting leg cramps lately along with the knee pain just attributed it to the aromasin it is not the charley horse pain that cherly described but just achy sore tired type of cramps hard to explain nasids seem to work so i take them sitting makes it worse but it never really goes away seen in several magazine articles that docs are now rxing neurontin for hot flashes so when i see my onc next month i am going to ask him for an rx i see my pcp the same day in the morning so i could ask her as well if i could find something to help manage the discomfort from the i would be more inclined to stay on it hugs karen i am open for any and all suggestions here i was diagonoised or had mammo last year 2007 when they found the tumor had the surgery in august lumpectomy and then did the radiation and was put on the arimidex i was not put on the arimidex till dec because of infection from draining of fluid under arm and in the hospital and such i made the arimidex for about 3 months then had to be switched to femara first off i have gained like 35 pounds since starting the radiation which i found out zapped my thyroid some and after 30 pounds had my synthroid increased weight gain seems to have stopped now the problem is i am having so much problem with joint pain tonight it is unbearable i have been put on an arthritis medication and i take osteo and another one called arthritis advantage i had a bone scan done a few weeks ago which showed arthritis in both knees feet toes and ankles and back and hip i had no problems with this before the the onco told me last time i saw him he could swithc me to tamoxifen but he would rather i stay on the if at all possible i am post menopause my onco dx was scored at 18 and i did not do chemo i have an 11 chance of recurrence on the tamox does anyone out there at all have any ideas what could be used for this joint pain or what could possibly help at all to make it bearable i cannot go on like this as i could not even come up my back steps tonight without hold the bannister and just about crawling no way can i go for 5 years like this i will be in a nursing home someone please give me any ideas at all on the pain does it help to take a 2 week vacation from the pills or does that make it worse when y ou go back help please log in to post a reply vicky i found taxol worse than ac the meds they gave me for ses on ac really helped me and did find that i ached from head to toe on the taxol though it was worse for the first one what helps enormously is to drink a lot of water especially the day of and the days following each tx i also got through it by telling myself that the pain was cancer getting killed and kicked out of my body i experienced the pain as healing in my mind which helped make it more bearable the good news is that once you get through these next weeks it will get better and your hair will grow back i kept focusing on the countdown as well give up you are killing the cancer so you can live your life with your family brca 1 2 negative but iam still getting gene testing for palb 2 tp53 and li fraumani syndrome and will be participating in a genetic research study because my mom and her brother both got cancer before they were 40 and her sister got eye cancer but no breast cancer in the family just a bit of everything else i did chemo before surgery and it must have totally destroyed my lymph nodes as they count any it was a clump of mush which was all negative for malignancy i needed the extra chemo because the tumour grew really fast in the 6 ishweeks between my last chemo and surgery i feel any tumour after my 3rd taxotere and then it came back cm mulifocal area and since triple negative with no targeted therapies available chemo was the only last option because they were worried that cancer cells could still be living in my blood lymph systems cisplatin is an old fashion platinum drug and was very harsh side effects were the worst out all the chemos done nausea and i also got lots of clotting issues and a pulmonary embolism during last chemo regime sbelizabeth i at your comment about the 8 heels blows my mind i can barely tolerate 2 heels for a few hours at a dinner how nice that your ps called to check on you lol tammy jeannie i hope you are feeling better today i hate when worries of reoccurance weigh on my mind my mother is a 10 year survivor and says no point in wasting time worrying about it i know she is right but that make it easy to put it out of my mind i agree with klanders i think that people who have not had to deal with cancer cannot understand the fear we carry with us elephant in the room perfect way to describe it scarring incisions i feel like raggedy ann at this point although most of the time the joy of having two breasts again outweighs it tamoxifen first round with it between chemo and rads i too got very depressed very depressed ro gave me permission to stop for rads and that was a relief i had a long talk with onc about it and he really wanted me to try it again after rads so before starting it again i started taking effexor for a few weeks to build up in my system when i started tami i had no depression this time around after about six months i tapered off of the effexor and i have been fine no depression except for after diep surgery for the first few weeks which is now gone i know why the depression did not come back after i stopped the effexor but i wanted to share my story in case it helps someone i am glad i tried one more time even though i was very fearful to but if i had gotten depressed again like i had been i would have definitely stopped it no ifs ands or the waterfall sounds wonderful what a great vacation tracy getting close to that three week mark woo hoo lol shechirple you rebel lahela good luck starting tami this week most women do just fine with it think positive jubby my ps gave me an abdominal binder to wear for at least six weeks is what she said just during the day although i left it at work so i am not wearing it this weekend oops a girdle sounds rough i hope she lets you stop it soon too you are at a rough point in your recovery keep taking care of you and as hard as it is try to keep reminding yourself that it will get better and it will mrtw my ps did not give me any restrictions either funny how different doctors can be when i was going through chemo a lot of the ladies in my group here had restrictions and my doctors did not give me any i must choose more relaxed doctors or they know a patient and know to pick their battles with me lol anyway i am no doctor but i really doubt that a couple of drinks will adversely effect your recovery especially at this point in the game just be mindful of what meds you are taking as some meds are not safe to drink with and that is not a shallow question the point imo of getting through all this cancer stuff if we going to get to enjoy life well i know what is going on with me i have a point in my incision under my lifted breast that has been very slow to heal ps has not been worried about it at all and says it totally normal and okay i cover it during the day with gauze and ointment and there is always a little yellow drainage at night i leave it open to air it does not look any worse but the last two days had just a little bit of blood on the gauze and yesterday evening omg it started to hurt big time sharp stabbing pain i had stopped the prescription painkillers but had to take one last night to sleep today it is still hurting but not as severe i just hope it is normal healing pain i see my ps on wednesday for my 5 week check up so i will show it to her then but it is so alarming to me when something new happens any of my il sisters have an allergic reaction to any of the chemo drugs currently on dd ac and also receive emend zofran decadron i initially noticed a rash on my chest that has now spread to my arms and back and yes i look lovely not bad enough to be bald with thin eyebrows and lashes my mo thought it was a zinc deficiency but have been taking zinc supplement for about a week and no better actually worse after having to visit the infusion center for iv fluids and meds this past friday heard that the taxanes can cause allergic reactions but i have any trouble with taxol so not sure if the adriamyacin cytoxin decadron zofran emend anyone else have this issue thanks for your feedback catwhispurr i too will be praying for you i had a tough time on both taxol was easier in that i have as many ses but the pain and neuropathy were very limiting and disheartening i also itched terribly and still do at times itched all over not just hands and feet i know why never any fever but no energy and get away from the pain oxy barely touched it i used advil pm to sleep kept my legs up and kept a heating pad on my knees and feet that helped ease it a lot i still have the neuropathy but not as badly it has only been 2 and a half weeks and i am told it can take much longer to get rid of that it is mostly in my toes and fingertips none of this is easy just different issues so thankful people here understand many have seemed to expect me to bounce right back now that i am done chemo i am better but certainly not myself and be for quite some time i think i start radiation in 2 weeks and pray that things are better somewhat by then i have been thankful for the break but restless to have things move along charb 22 yes my feet peeled mostly my heels it has gotten better but was weird overall very dry skin i have chalked anything that is unusual to me up to the effects of chemo i underestimate what this has done to me nfranklin how did things go today thought of you this afternoon hope you are resting tonight with little to no steroid buzz hope everyone sleeps well tonight i think i am beginning to see a little bit of fuzz on my head but it may be wishful thinking andi i do my neulasta just about exactly 24 hours later so far my white counts have been good and i have not knock on wood been sick with anything since chemo started except a uti and they gave me bactrim for that and it cleared right up but i am prone to utis so that was nothing unusual kathleen i wonder if you can trim eyebrow hair so far again knock on wood my brows and lashes are pretty good a little thin but nothing major i know if they will start doing something when i get taxol 2 or not not dreading it as bad as ac because i know i be really sick but not looking forward to the body aches and not to unload on everyone but do you sometimes think your family forgets you are going through chemo 2 of my grown sons understand i just have the energy to do everything one is leaving for active duty and needs a hundred things done and expects me to do them because i always have and yes i did it all too but i will miss him but miss some of the stress he gives me and my house is looking terrible but i just have the energy to do some cleaning after work oh well it will be there later starting oct 21st i will be going for weekly taxol for 12 weeks i sure hope it carry the same fatigue i have felt with a i think i could have taken another round of that thank god done with that hi there this is my 2nd time with bc first time was 4 years ago and i had lumpectomy chemo and radiation followed by tamoxifen i also had genetic testing done and found out that i do not have the brca defects given that i had a only a 3 chance of recurrence but i guess i got lucky this last dx was in early november despite being on tamoxifen the tumor was in the same place as the first one but not clear if it was a recurrence or a new primary although both tumors were er pr this time already had bilateral mastectomy and chemo and am now receiving lupron shots to put me in menopause since only 42 so that i can take arimidex this is because the tamoxifen proved to not work in my case so my dr theorizes that i metabolize it correctly the hope is that arimidex will work to keep me from having another recurrence so planning to have my ovaries removed at the end of the summer to make the menopause a permanent thing and the decision trying to make before then is should i have only the ovaries removed or should i just go ahead and have a full hysterectomy while at it my onc says i only need to have the ovaries removed as far as he is concerned i do have endometriosis fairly widespread though i suffer no symptoms other than my kids are adopted so i had thought that i might as well take out the uterus now just so i have to do it later if when the endo gets really bad but my surgeon for this says that by removing the ovaries the endometriosis will die anyway once not fed by hormones any more so not really a motivator anymore i still have the tendency to think while at it just get rid of never done me any good anyway but i recognize that a greater risk to have a bigger surgery and i just decide to do it without a good reason probably so be curious if anybody here has any thoughts on this would you take just the ovaries or do the full hysterectomy and why perhaps some of you have even had to make this same decision i would very much appreciate the feedback of anyone who responds will help me think through this and see it from different angles i think thanks in advance for your input amy penny i just had taxol 3 last thursday and so far with all 3 of them are i feel great other then the day of infusion i get real sleepy from the benadryl also the decadron makes me a little hyper that night and on friday but not as bad as with the having great luck so farwith the taxol i wish the same for you my pre treat meds are benadryl tagamet and decadron i have to take anything else and never had one second of nausea on the taxol juanita dear all after 18 months on arimidex and before that 2 years on tamoxifen yesterday my doc swapped my meds to exemestane aromisin been gaining weight lbs in 2 months after careful eating and training like a triathalonist i also suffered major mood swings depression and joint pain throughout my body so switching also on wellbutrin for the depression after taking effexor for 3 years for hot flashes and wonder if the combination of an ai and has caused weight gain anyway so sick of meds taking them switching them talking about them any help or encouragement would be appreciated if i gain any more weight i will seriously be depressed weight gain bad for a of bc why doctors listening to us about all this claire in az aviva 5675 i had no se on anastrozole the first 3 months except for stiffness in the morning in my feet and a couple of trigger fingers in the left hand that all went away in about 1 minute of moving then i started to get stiff if i sat for an hour or more but still went a way once i moved for a minute after about a year that stiffness became less and less granted i still get the stiffness in the morning also my feet get sore if been on them a lot other than that and the damn osteoporosis i was just diagnosed with in october it unless i eat jalapenos they can give me some slight warm flashes at night but not sure anastrozole related my sister is still dealing with hot flashes years and she went through menopause the natural way it may be because in chemopause and would have happened if i went through natural menopause timbuktu assume the cipro will make it worse since i get nauseous easily including anesthesia and narcotics assumed be puking my brains out on chemo never had to take any puke pills really hope they can get to the bottom of wrong at least they are continuing to follow up keep us posted good morning finished treatment 6 yesterday i am way through taxol so far so good except for tuesday i am up with the chickens a m today thanks to the steroid i hope it put a damper on my day today i am the type of person that likes to keep busy i have no time for it to slow me down my week after treatment 5 too bad a few aches here and there but nothing to scream about the nurse said taxol is responsible for that my hair is really shedding quickly as these weeks go buy i want to go to the beauty polar today and get it cut even shorter i noticed a few breakouts on my forehead next monday i have an appointment with the dermatologist the mo and then treatment 7 lynn your mo will decide if you need to make it up if you need to worry about it they know what they are doing in addition i think i read somewhere that they are researching if taxol is actually necessary for us early stagers it may not be the most important drug is the herceptin michelle 6 weeks out of chemo just hearing how you are enjoying those water sports is such an inspiration for us enjoy hugs mary hello adagio thank you for a very interesting and thoughtful post i think we have the same thoughts about metformin as you say taking it is just introducing another drug into the system which the body has to process i can understand why you would not have wanted to go into a trial i admire those who do because ultimately they are being used as guinea pigs it will be interesting when we have some results of these trials but even then i shall have doubts i have read too much about trials being conducted to prove what they want to prove some of the side effects of metformin brand name glucophage remind me of the side effects of chemotherapy drugs they are loss of appetite and a metallic taste nausea and vomiting not to mention diarrhoea other side effects may be dizziness and confusion weakness and sweating and rash apparently there is the problem of interaction with other drugs which can increase or reduce the effectiveness of metformin i agree with you that like most drugs metformin as a preventive for recurrence in breast cancer may work for some but not for others it is like tamoxifen brand names nolvadex soltamox for hormonal breast cancer it does not work for everyone and there are tamoxifen failures of course tamoxifen has side effects a friend of mine on tamoxifen after treatment for hormonal breast cancer is putting on weight she does not like this and it happens despite the fact that she does a lot of physical exercises like you i am eating a good diet doing walking and gardening and taking just a few supplements mainly for osteoporosis but for good health vitamin b complex vitamin c and a multi vitamin and mineral supplement i think we are on the same wavelength i was glad to know that you still read and enjoy the forum but really glad to know that you are enjoying very much not thinking about cancer that is the way to go forward remember that we do need posts to keep the thread going and it is nice to look upon the thread not only as a support and comfort medium not to mention information centre but also as a friendship club we are all much more than our cancers thinking of you sylvia xxxx i took tamoxifen for 14 months i stopped taking it because i lost my hearing too afraid to try any of the other meds my onco believe me even when i took her 5 pages of information i found on the internet tamoxifen is like a chemo drug and we all know how hard chemo is on our hair and the nerves in our inner ears are like little hairs this happen to very many women just older ones like me and yes i know a lot of women who have done great taking tamoxifen and i would never tell them to quit but just be aware of any med you take even if you experience something that is not listed as a se hi all yet more good news i know if i can believe it i actually saw a professor of dermatology today and he has told me that the lumps lesions are not bacterial therefore no antibiotics needed and the fact that they are healing up so well now shows that my immune system is working really well he actually said you are doing really well big smirk on my face just so you know what it was and why i got it in case anyone else experiences this i have got nodular vasculitis of the granular form caused by a combination of being immunosuppressed last december 3 hospital admissions in as many weeks with neutropenic shock and the drugs he did explain a bit more about antigens etc but i remember all that he has taken a blood sample for testing they always and i go back and see him in 6 weeks but i am thrilled to bits as i have been concerned that my poor immune system has been fighting a skin infection instead of beating the sh t out of the cancer cells so if my immune system is working well maybe that together with the tamoxifen might hold things for a little while we shall see like you louise i am busy charging up hills and cycling etc and wheezing a bit but then all my mates tell me that i do so much more than them and they are tired all the time too and they have cancer so i must be okay i hoping love to you all sue x eli glad they are giving the mouth sores a break and glad the little dictator has been deposed and when he comes back be weaker muahaha my eye doctor is very dismissive when i mention repeatedly that on tamoxifen i do have watery and blurry eyes and he says just regular aging never worn glasses in my life i think related to either the chemo taxotere or the tamoxifen so the stents help stop the watering is that right marlegal glad to know the watery eyes quit after you finished tamoxifen joanne sorry the travel plans have been delayed but how sweet of your granddaughter to console you hopefully after all your treatments are over you can reward yourself with that trip i took years of french in high school and college and only remember a couple of phrases i guess use it or lose it love to go to france my son is getting ready to graduate from college and his school is offering the best tour package to europe ever seen i wonder if they need chauffeurs haha he would love that jeanie i will be having my first ct scan after i complete the 8th cycle will post the results later on i was in wheelchair on oxygen fulltime before dx now i can climb stairs go out for moderate walks and have my pleural effusions treated mostly taxotere as i have read on the boards is a tough chemo but achieves very impressive results so i am very thankful to tax i experienceddiarrhea once along the way when my doc suggested florastor ebru hi karen i know how you feel 2 ops later and he says he has removed it all margins now all clear i still feel the cord in armpit but am doing the exercises to hopefully lessen the strangeness of feeling still in the pit not looking forward to next week though as they say the effects will come out more i do realise that i have not gone through as much as others i have read though 15 rads in total and started tamoxifen on the 24th feb for the next years like they say everyone is different i have no shoulder arm pain anymore but i do the exercises as much as they say to do them and i am also back at gym classes ppl cannot believe this tbh yoga and pilates to start with for a couple of weeks then done 3 aerobic classes which make me feel more like myself hello all i need some information been on tamoxifen since october 16 2008 and then was off for a few weeks and been back on since december or something now having severe depression and anxiety my new psychiatrist prescribed wellbutrin which when we went to pick it up were told that it keeps tamoxifen from working metabolizing as i did research i found that many ssris prevent tamoxifen from working the worst being wellbutrin paxil prozac cymbalta abilify less so celexa and lexapro problem is on lexapro anyway one article said that if one is on tamoxifen they should avoid ssris totally i just know what to do as my psychiatrist has no clue and my oncologist told me she regularly prescribes lexapro to her cancer patients i wish there were a list of definate that one take if on tamoxifen and what we can take anyone have any insight on this had my 3rd dose of taxol on thursday hair was continuing to come out so much that by saturday i had it chopped off kind of a buzz cut get my port in next tuesday if my cold goes away in time pretty sure not treatment related as all the kids and my grandson had it first pretty much the only se seen is the hair loss still consider myself lucky at this point thanks for your responses ladies it is very helpful to hear about first hand experiences with both the ascites and the gemzar jill how did gemzar as a single agent work for you did your oncologist give a reason for not pairing it with another chemo this is something we need to ask my oncologist about on wednesday laura taxol was very effective for my mom but left her with some neuropathy so not an option for now i wish you great success with that combo invisible your situation does sound very similar to my her case has been unusual from the and it just continues to be unpredictable it sounds like you have had great success on your chemo which chemo did you take to help resolve the ascites best of luck to you in your continued treatment thanks again hi all i have been in a fairly dark place feeling sorry for myself i had my 3rd ac on the 10th and am still experiencing nausea i take some ativan but hate the spacey think feeling just having a rough go i guess 1 more of the ac on the 24th then onto 4 taxol for me i lost most of my hair right before i got the 2nd treatment i went ahead and shaved it off by the way the lint roller is a great idea can i complain some more food tastes terrible i do use plastic utensils always water yuck i am soooo tired of all of this i wish i could be more upbeat but with treatments and trying to work it is taking a toll ok enough complaining thank you for listening i hope you all are fairing better today went on abraxane in july also hair fell out after two weeks and it has been six weeks since my last chemo and no sign of anything my guess would be chichie head welcome lolo sorry about your recent breast cancer diagnosis and am glad you found this forum i wish you well as you proceed through treatment regarding the ovarian cyst given your history of still bleeding too bad they get everything out your starting tamoxifen in november prior to your lumpectomy and your significantly increasing pelvic pain suggesting enlargement of the cyst that was found very possible that at operation this will be a benign cyst sure they told you our premenopausal ovaries can develop cysts on tamoxifen certainly your history suggests active enlargement since tamoxifen which goes more along with a benign process complex cysts can have septations too be rooting for you on this as well as on your subsequent breast lumpectomy pathology i hope post and let us know how you do did they suggest stopping the tamoxifen in the interim so that ovarian cyst cause even more problems like falling over on itself due to weight ovarian torsion just a thought you might wish to discuss with your doctors good luck tender two days past first taxol my eyes watered a lot yesterday better today head still feel quite right but no nausea back is hurting a little red flush is gone tmd i read this stat first on webmd chemotherapy and hair loss about a year ago i had no luck with their archives in pulling up the article however other web sites have read hundreds literally have stated the same scott hamiltons site is great as well as chemotherapy and in general it is the drug and dosage that determines whether or not hair loss occurs and not the type of cancer one has cytoxan causes hair thinning not necessarily hair loss fluro does not cause hair loss so many women getting cmf have no hair loss taxol almost always causes hair loss and adriamycin usually causes hair loss states that the the cold cap showed good results for most and they do not rec against it other web sites state there is no benefit and use could result in cancer of the scalp the problem with so many cancer web sites is that the info can be up to 10 years old my curiosity re cold caps and head cancer was the issue of the blood brain barrier perhaps onc was ref head cancer other than the brain know still waaiting for some of the org s brainiacs to come along and educate me lol tender otter helllooooo nico i am now 58 and went through menopause 10 years ago then had complete hysterectomy my onco put me on tamoxifen due to the osteoporosis been taking it for almost 2 months and so far no side effects to speak of had hot flashes night sweats since april when b c was diagnosed and the docs took away my premarin the hot flashes arenot anyworse or any better with the tamoxifen i take effexor started at the lowest dose and have bumped it up now to 75 mgs still not much relief for the hot flashes i intend to ask for another increase not sure how long you have to wait between increases if that help eliminate the hot flashes i sure wish someone would recommend something that helps them summer is right around the corner hi i have asthma i finished chemo in feb i found during chemo that i had bad asthma about a week after each tax as it gave me a sore throat and that seemed to spark off the asthma otherwise like you whilst on chemo i was less wheezy and my peak flow was good i think it might be the regular steroids i am finding being on herceptin is agrivating it again i think it might be that it gives me a dry mouth with mild taste changes i eat spicy food which i love i think the dry mouth is bringing on the wheezing i am going back to the lemon and ginger herbal teas with half a teaspoon of honey instead of ordinary tea i was drinking this during chemo as i stand the taste of tea it seems to help keep my mouth less dry and hopefully less asthma marian xxx dear katts the duration of various hormonal therapies can vary and depends on menopausal status stage of disease and goals of therapy since aromatase inhibitors such as arimidex are not effective in women who have functioning ovaries these drugs are approved for use in postmenopausal women when premenopausal women are treated with aromatase inhibitors they are usually given in combination with treatments to shut down the ovaries essentially making the woman postmenopausal the ovaries can be shut down permanently with surgical removal or temporarily with drugs like zoladex during treatment with zoladex it is impossible to determine whether or not natural menopause has occurred as the shots will usually prevent menstrual cycles and will affect the blood tests frequently used to measure menopausal status there is no exact limit as to how long zoladex can be continued however there are side effects such as discomfort at the injection site and bone density loss if the zoladex is stopped and the arimidex is continued it would be appropriate to follow estradiol levels regularly the levels should remain very low if you are truly postmenopausal it would be best to discuss this further with your physician teresa so glad to hear that your dog is doing better having many animals myself going to have to look into these oils you speak of i spend a fortune at the vets but have learned to take a wait and see attitude on most treatments my animals are all elderly so hesitant to put then through much sounds like i could benefit from the oils as well been on anastrazole since november and it has been the worst part of the entire bc treatment for me i pretty much sailed through chemo and radiation had herceptin for a year and was feeling pretty darn good for the first few months of the ai this past spring i started having a lot worse aching and stiffness not the joints but the muscles after sitting for a while or getting up in the morning i shuffle around and literally groan in pain felt like i aged 20 years in 6 months the worst thing though is the chronic fatigue no matter how much i sleep or rest always tired i was big into exercise running strength training pilates etc before my diagnosis but stopped during treatment now back to walking 3 miles every morning which used to energize me but now just exhausts me i still get winded or out of breath if i walk up even a small incline or stairs so discouraging short term memory is still shot and i have the brain fog everyone talks about thankfully it affected my work so far my job involves math and analysis and been able to focus enough to do it so far but i worry about it if these cognitive issues continue my onc wants me on anastrozole for 2 years and then will switch me to tamoxifen easier on the bones bit the bullet and struggle through the next 16 months as i know how important the ai is to stave off but i feel like this is pay back for having such an easy time with chemo going to start yoga next week to hopefully help with the muscles but for the first time in my life i feel old i just turned 60 but always felt and looked way younger but no so much now sigh love that you found and have a boyfriend through this madness we find ourselves in gives me hope except i think i have the energy for a relationship right now hard enough having 2 teenagers still at home to deal with but at some point in the future love to be in love again ah to get roses sound like a good man who knows how to romance enjoy it i hope everyone in the group is doing well i check the board most days but posted much sometimes i have to step back from the whole bc experience and take a deep breath to focus on other things i think the quietness of the board means others are doing that as well trying to live a normal life after the apocalypse always be hovering though and reading about everyone and checking in when i can to a great summer for us all annie hi ameron given anzemet by iv during my infusion taking weekly taxol and herceptin with carboplatin thrown in every 3rd week on the weeks i take the carbo along with the t and h i take zofran by mouth for nausea for 3 days after treatment and on just the t h weeks i have compazine which i needed so far i also take prescription omeprezone which i believe is the prescription pepsid because had previous problems with gerd my nausea has been very well controlled it breaks thru occasionally with just a queasy feeling but it passes quickly i was told anzemet works not only on the digestive tract but also on the brain to prevent the nausea before it occurs would think that holds true in the pill form as well so far so good for me in terms of nausea and vomiting anzemet is not my only nausea med but part of my treatment good luck to you and may your experience be relatively se free wow laura you are describing what happens to me all day longplus i also have about 10 hot flashes a day face and neck andhair wet and face bright red and i feelweak all over when it happens i was like this on 5 years of tamoxifen one month of now almost 8 weekson femara no change little more pain in hands and wrist been on celebrex foryears so i imagine it helps a lot glad to see i am normal lol bc hugs jinky welcome tigre 55 i can relate to your time frame and treatment sequence as i was dx stage 4 in april also i was on taxol weekly from april thru august and have just started round two of xeloda i had the same experience with how vicious the nausea could be and also heartburn i am now religiously taking meds for each of those side effects when i take the xeloda i am super motivated to get this to work for me as the next step would be back to the chemo lounge and starting ac my hair is slowly coming back my nails are improving and the thought of losing those tiny triumphs is tough to take obviously i will do what needs to be done but i do whine a bit before i adapt to changes i hope you can be patient with getting your xeloda routine worked out keep us posted and i wish you the best hi ladies of course pam join right in be doing that in the summer and i think the cherry on top with a tweak or so in january on my recon on lupron now i notice that it does much of anything and that might be a more user friendly way for you to go as it can hold those little cancer making demons the ovaries at bay and ease you into menopause a bit before you do the whole enchilada i know a thing about zolodex but if you start a thread asking someone will be along for you i hope actually with the lupron it does stop or lessen your periods as it mimics menopause then by the summer you might actually be in menopause anyway your heavy periods can be a sign of that beginning did you have your hormone levels checked to see where you are it sounds like you could use a bit of a break i was there too and put off the ooph hyst with myoncs blessing i hope you canget a solution that you can feel more comfortable with for now good luck anniep s louishenry tamoxifen never gave me any of those things it was just a little pill i took at bedtime and i slept great that kept me safe everyone is different you could always try it for a bit anyway good lucklilyj i had anxiety attacks too i think this stuff is cumulative we go and do it all and then suddenly wonder why we are freaking out well who normal not normal is to act like all of this is aok and we are terrific at least my feeling i had my daughter two stillbirths a failed surrogacy frozen embryos and i sti ll and ambivalent about losing all the feminine stuff on the other hand i am still me and we need any more birth controlswimangel hi sweetie xoxo jp mom sorry about the nodes a shock to get over your hair looks quite thick and long since lumpectomy was not an option for me i had surgery first an awful lot of positive nodes freaks me out and hoping the rads gets whatever nodes are left starting arimidex probably next month and metformin also the first dose of ac chemo gave me some major hot flashes had to change my pajamas 4 times a night some nights just had taxol 9 and the hair that started to grow after 2 is still falling out all those hard earned little white hairs nails a bit sore too and eye brows seems suspended in growth at about their usual length and too blond to see without a pencil hi all just letting you know my scans have come back all clear lung thing exactly the same so probably an old scar and brca negative so today draws a line for me under this part of the storyline i got pulled into last february i started tamoxifen 2 days ago and so far know my ongoingissues that have yet to disappear are hot flashes wake me up once twice per night weakness in my legs lack of energy but improving hair growing back at least 50 gray getting tips from hair hair hair thread but will be doing a colour some time not ready to be be a graceful gray yet and yes i know in charley how are you feeling one week down the track to all still having treatment hugs to you almost done lisa hello i took letrozole for 18 months and have had absolutely no bone problems and had bone scans to confirm this i do take calcium every day so bone problems occur now been changed to anastrozole cos the hot flushes were a bit grim after 40 odd years of oestrogen in one form or another and i had brain fuddle so now i feel like e real person again just a bit of joint stiffness which goes away if i dance about under a warm shower in the mornings i think ringing your breast nurse would be helpful and put your mind at rest as she will know your full medical history and explain things for you i imagine delaying starting the letrozole for a few days will do any harm these are drugs and i did have to have a 2 week break when i changed drugs and absolutely fine the medics recommend anything that harms us they just explain it properly sometimes and of course we all think of the important questions when we get home all the best grumpy goodmorning everyone i had another great nights sleep which surprised me does anyone else get really bloated after hydration my stomach must get twice its size and zip pants this morn going down trying to stay ahead of the constipation but bridget i hope you are doing well ac was much worse for me than the taxotere handle neulesta because of restless leg syndrom still tough with the neupogen but nowhere as bad donna great your daughter will be with you i miss my mother and we are looking into visiting her this summer when i can fit the time in krista i hope you are feeling better grannie i see my surgeon next month for checkup i was told 25 rads my onc said have about a 3 week break between last chemo and the start of rad my question i keep wanting to ask but i is after all this do i have a test scan or something of my entire body that shows clean gone i guess time to make a list lets all have a good day chris wish that is a medical mystery one of my favorite shows mystery dx let us know traci sorry about the bk that really sucks have you tried seeing if they just switch you to a texas hmo is a plane ticket cheaper than a blood draw you could get your doc to fax a request and get it drawn at a local hosp and have them fax it back to the doc alaskadeb and all those still on chemo that sucks keep your nails very short so you catch them on anything i was on taxotere and they tried to separate from the bed 4 months later they are finally back to normal still a little yellow christine the inside skin of an egg is a great drawing ointment you can scrape some off and put in on the pimple and then put a bandaid on it do not do this is you are on chemo because eggs can have some diseases in them it is great for boils and splinters it pulls out all the sorry ladies pus nothing to bitch about today waiting on the fedex man because he cannot find our house they have we are out in the country with no street signs sheila when i first got bc i googled images of mastectomy and came across this website with an open wound that would not close the pix are very graphic and gave me nightmares but they used something called silverlon npd with vac and the results were amazing after 3 weeks the huge gaping wound was completely closed you may want to check with your ps about that here is the website and it is not for the fainthearted julie i had neoadjuvant chemo and yes they knew it was tn taxol was way easier than a c not as tiring for me unfortunately i have had some type of reaction with every chemo drug my first taxol i was fine and out of the blue vomited several times as a result they insisted that i have benadryl with each infusion and iv benadryl knocks me on my butt i did not have neulasta shots with taxol and at least with doing weekly infusions had no problem with blood counts as far as the neuropathy i took b vitamins and to help i did not start noticing neuropathy until near the end i still have some very mild neuropathy in my toes but also had cisplatin on a trial and that made it worse again good luck deb this fatigue is making me one lazy grumpy soul and almost three weeks post infusion anyway less than a week from my first lighting up and so ready to get this show on the road hole in one bone pain nasty stuff mine just started about two weeks ago and in the hip and knee of my left leg and it just quit last night was the first night the pain woke me up from sleep i hope mine goes away in another couple of weeks smrivr the side effects from taxol have been crazy for me i started with a crusty bloody dry nose then progressed to pain when i urinated and thought it was a uti but after two samples tested both came back clean and told it was a side effect of the taxol on top of all that around week 10 of taxol i started breaking out in a rash starting on my hands and forearms after going to the dermatologist he took a skin sample and sent it off to see exactly what it was the path report came back positive for chemo related rash it has just started going away on my hands but it seems to be taking longer on my arms back and legs about two weeks ago i started have pain in my left leg hip and knee another wonderful side effect from taxol so today the nose issues have started to clear up the pain when going to the bathroom is still around but not as intense rash is still visible on my arms back chest and legs but getting better and the leg pain is quite debilitating oh and also have neuropathy on the bottom of both feet nice i hope you experiencing any of these but if you do soldier on you will get through it my mantra has been this whole journey has been it is what it is and alive to testify hi all posted for a bit and welcome kari going for taxol 7 this friday hope i can make through them all getting more tired with each anda bitmore tingling in feet i too have bloody nose only when i blow in the am very congested thought it was from getting over a cold and allergies or just the taxol also have the hemmorhoids and whatever else down there using rx steroid cream which helps and drinking metamucil not so bad now that on taxol was horrible with ac get unblinded april 30 know if i can go on are any of you thinking about zometa interested in that also does your hair grow back while on avastin only my hair is starting to grow back but still losing eyebrows hi everyone on day 6 of taxol 3 and just sailing through i wait for my last one i have any bone pain this time around although lost two toenails and one fingernail is starting to look iffy i get all of the strange side effects i have my three month follow up already scheduled with my onc at that point going to give me a blood test to see if menopausal been chemopausal since i started and if so start on an ai if not start on tamoxifen in between then and now got my radiation consult scheduled so be doing that until june my oncology office prints out a calendar for us and mine is looking pretty sparse with just lab and aranesp shots it will be strange not to be going there constantly we are all either finished or on the home stretch thank you all of you for your support and excellent advice i will try claritin if onc agrees and ice first taxotere went fine nurse said an allergic reaction would happen in the first 15 minutes and it this morning there wasa bout of nausea that quickly went away and now my stomach hurts eating ginger and a banana helped some but otherwise okay even have to ask for a second opinion both doctors suggested it first next wednesday i go to riverside methodist hospital in columbus ohio for a second opinion breast clinic and free funded by the komen foundation wow will probably also travel to philadelphia to see dr c maybe take amtrak and make a most excellent girlfriend adventure out of it bless you all for caring for each other hope could you give us an update on you kim in ohio switching over to arimidex and wanted to ask how long does it take hopefully that i start to lose some of this tamoxifen weight and will my hair miraculously get thicker now that not taking it anymore those who switched or stopped taking it what was your experience not ready to hear the about arimidex yet just praying that my quality of life gets a lot better off tamoxifen deal with the arimidex as that comes would appreciate to hear stories about life after tamoxifen hi paxton i did 3 mos of weekly abraxane i lost my hair in the third week i had problems mostly with neuropathy in my fingers and toes i worked with no problem throughout then i did 3 mos of fec every three weeks i had to wear an iv pump for 48 hours with it i had quite a bit of nausea for the next three days also fatigue then i would be fine again until the next tx i also suffered a lot of depression during those three days so heads up on that my last chemo was last jan 21 and i still have a little neuropathy but not debilitating i hope yours goes se free deen i m taking tamoxifen which is causing night sweats can anyone suggest anything herbal that i can take along side my medication that will alleviate this problem i would be so grateful and i know my husband would be eternally thankful to get a good nights sleep thank you from one hot chick alison i can assure you that every one of us was frightened of chemo i still remember my first fec april 2008 and was absolutely convinced i was going to be sick as a dog with it not so i faithfully took the meds and they worked my advice is to take the meds as prescribed wait until you feel nauseous because they are supposed to work to prevent any nausea but if one med work for you be sure to call your onc to prescribe another one pronto drink lots of water during and after your tx i had 3xfec and 3xtaxotere tax was not nice no nausea but just about every other s e the one i hated the most was thrush and subsequent lack of taste just a suggestion since in the uk have you considered using the cold caps to preserve your hair see the thread here about taxotere and hair loss although docs warning patients about it there is the remote possibility that your hair grow back by the way i found frozen pineapple chunks to be very soothing and a great snack hugs and good wishes to you linda hi trish i found taxol to be a lot less difficult than the a c but my lashes and brows came out with taxol and i had a little neruopathy i took b6 every day still do and that has kept the neuropathy at bay the lashes and brows came back super fast they may have come out after i finished taxol i remember now i have the exhaustion at all w taxol so life felt pretty normal congratulations on almost being done with a c a big hurdle hugs erica could my current blurred vision looking through a dark gray fog be related to my chemotherapy treatments on aug 31 2011 i completed six cycles of herceptin taxotere and carboplatin cisplatin for breast 2 stage 3 and lung cancer i am now receiving a maintenance dose of herceptin every three weeks and finished my 12th dose of herceptin on january 18 2012 the gray fog first occurred in october 2011 in the right eye only it came and went away in two weeks however this recent occurrence in january 2012 is more severe and came on slowly again only in the right eye been looking through the dark gray fog for two weeks now i justvisited the ophthalmologist and he has referred me to a because there may bea problem with my optic nerve i hope this problem is only temporary has anyone else had visionproblems with the chemo drugs herceptin taxotere or carboplatin i have no vision problems in the left eye i am still here just tired i feel so fatigued i have cycle 5 of 6 tch next week been sleeping well for those of you that are on lupron does it make your chemo side effects worse they want me to have a hysterectomy 4 weeks after chemo i am wondering if they will just put me on lupron so they can start arimidex right after i finish chemo i am already having hot flashes and insomnia any other goodies that lupron brings hey all just had my second dose of taxol and have developed nail infections im not sure itts not nueropathy but they started me on antibiotics any nueropathy stories out there would be apreciated on a positive im thrilled to be done with ac treatments i read something similar to that in an early description of the gene issue and tamoxifen what i read categorized hot flashes as moderate severe specifing a number per day is more precise many women find that the hot flash effect diminishes as they continue taking the drug so i wish they would address that still i let hot flashes or absence of turm me away from the drug because they also find other factors are involved in who has hot flashes like body weight exercise status consumption of certain things red wine so it may not be altogether simple i finished chemo in june and radiation in spetember started tamoxifen in july i was put into chemo induced menopause i had joint pain and pain that kept me up and hated the pain meds i think time and 30 to 45 minutes of exercise a dayhelped me i also took glucosamine tablets but once i really started exercising i found that i did not need them i have not taken so can not address that i do know that the pain became bad for me when i went into instant menopause 8 months into the tamoxifen i hate that it slows the metabolism butthe worse thing for me is the way it screws up the brain i have read a few posts that say that got better in a year or so see tinker it it is in a class of drugs called selective estrogen receptor modulators serm include hot flashes leg cramps swelling of the extremities syndrome joint pain sweating and difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep there are dietary considerations to increase calcium and vitamin d the one big plus i see is that it has not been found to cause vaginal bleeding nor increase the risk of cancer of the uterine lining it does increase the risk to develop blood clots in legs or lungs this may be a viable alternative for some people who do experience gyn issues on tamoxifen didel have you been able to get your gyn to schedule an us like dh said this is not something to fool around with while i really really like medical tests procedures i did learn it is much better to catch problems early i sure wanted to bury my head in the sand but that an option jo for breakfast my stomach is growling hi iwas 46 when i was dx with dcis with comedonecrosis grade 2 stage 0 i had started running when i turned 40 hadnever run before that and i had started to gain weight then just before i turned 46 i got shingles and had been battling a running injury so the shingles were enough to stop my running and i attempted to start walking but it the same so i stopped then i was dx with bc 8 months later i did start to run again after my rads run duringrads as i was also having rads on the top of my toe due to recurrent basal cell and it had a bad reaction which took 3 weeks to heal enough to get the okto cover it and run so i coulddo the komen 5k but i have enough time to train and it a fun running experience went back to getting strong andhave started back running in dec 07 i am training right and learning to do it recreational and it feels great so it is helping with the mental stress i have beenon tamoxifen now for just over 6 months and have had some issues with polyps and now cysts had one surgery already to remove polyps and now another pending for the cysts but other wise i think the running and acupuncture has helped as i have very little se from the tamox and i have lost weight and am now maintaining actually i feel better than i have in a long time so my advice is keep running i think it helps most with the mental stress which is often not dealt with as well as the se of hormone therapy and it just feels goodbetsy per the site seek medical attention right away if any of these severe side efficts occur when using tamoxifen on the first line it mentions difficulty breathing while not nearly as frightening i had severe bone pain which my doc kept telling me an se of tamox yes it is i quit the drug because at age 47 i about to give up being able to walk up a flight of steps that quality of life thing is important good luck sorry to hear the first treatment was so tough i guess it has to be to kick that cancer to the curb hang in there and i will do the same just had my second treatment today i will go back in for a neulasta shot tomorrow the taxotere really knocks my wbc down i have been losing a lot of hair since last week too so after this one it will be time to get the clippers out soon was not looking forward to the hair loss either i have to really make myself eat this time seem to have much of an appetite they sent me home today with some boost protein drinks hope they taste too bad take care judy if you divide the pill and getting the actual amount that was prescribed for you is it going to work that is sort of like taking half of an antibiotic that is prescribed to get rid of an infection it i was on aromasin for 49 months thought it was only two years but looked it up and it said 49 months and took a 25 mg tablet once a day when my ca went up my onco switched me to faslodex but the aromasin kept me in remission and actually shrunk my tumors while i was on it you are going to get some ses with anything but if you think they are too much to deal with then just take the medication period i think taking a half or a third of whatever is going to have the effect it is supposed to have since it is not the theraputic dose that was prescribed just my humbleopinion i do think there is a great deal to be said for quality of life but if taking a ai is going to keep your cancer from recurring or progressing just mho again it is worth it i realize we all react differentlyto drugs but the ses i had with ais were nothing compared to chemo plus they went away and the side effects of chemo always do that i still have some neuropathy and my toenails have still not grown back and been two years since the chemo that really about did me in i gained weight while on tamoxifen but was able to take it off when i was on aromasin i had bone pain on both but actually thought i had arthritis until i found out it could be from the drugs but since they were keeping me in remission and stable i about to stop taking them i suppose being stage lv i look at things a bit differently but at this point i am very happy to be alive and am happy to say i have any ses that i cannot live with ok so you can see my scalp i wake up with muscle spasms that make me want to scream tonic water helps i have started to drop things because of neuropathy but i still go places am able to work and have a good time going out with friends and love working in the yard i know a woman who did the lupron and dealt with it quite well got her into remission and when she finished her chemo and was off the lupron she went on to have two children elena i am not dismissing how bad the ses were for your brother but i am saying she did not think it was all that bad again we are all different in the way we react to things i did not do tamoxifen as preventative after my mastectomy even though i waser the reason being it was 1990 and they were still doing trailswith it plus the fact i had 19 lmyph nodes removed and all were negative so they really did not feel my cancer would recurr well obviously that was not correct since i was diagnosed with mets to bone as well as liver in 98 and immediately moved up to stage lv i am not trying to tell anyone what to do we all have to make our own decisions in that respect and hope we made the right one however if i were doing this all over again know what i do today and was given a choice i would take the weight gain the aches and pains the night sweats etc and take my aromasin or tamoxifen or whatever if there was a good chance that it would keep me from going to stage lv at least by being er pr you have a choice sorry is i may have written this all before but i had such good results with aromasin that i help responding when i see a post regarding it surfa think advice is sound fyi i was in similar situation and opted to have fat grafting in diep breast to match natural breast i also had the dilemma of having lifts or no and areola reduction on natural side i opted not to do it and am pleased with that decision for me my breasts are much more symmetrical now since fat grafting but diep side is still smaller at this stage i can absolutely live with the difference ie it looks like a natural breast that is just a bit smaller than the other side but see what am left with after swelling goes down re bikes i agree with you about being less agile and am feeling even less agile on tamoxifen with these joint pains thanks to everyone for your comments and concern i was back on my bike yesterday and breast seems fine and yes i wear a helmet the joke around here was maybe i need a breast plate too hi ladies i had a little disruption in my xeloda cycle due to the severe bm issues tummy got better and i started it up again then my cycle was over on monday i start cycle two this upcoming monday and i hope that i do ok i started to get really tired towards the end could have been the ot with work too this next two weeks i have to do ot so i plan on veggin out on my couch watching tv i hate taking all the pills yes i know some of you wonderful women take much more than me but i cannot complain too much this is much better than taxotere and i get to keep what little hair i have i even helped my dh sister and bil put wood flooring down in my family living and dining area this past weekend good morning everyone jill i am on 3 fec then 3 taxotere and i have not had any shots at all during this for nausea i have zofran maxeran anddecadron and have not had one ounce of nausea so far so good anyways hope your chest xray goes good and feeling better macia apologize for anything we all know how busy we are with all this pretty much everyone updates on upcoming treatments anyways find this week like last time i get alot more tired quicker and actually take a nap when i can hope your se are kept to a minimum 3 on friday blood tests tomorrow have a great day everyone or at least a good oneterri dear jayoung as you have now learned different doctors have different opinions about the best way to treat breast cancer there is no guaranteed best regimen abraxane has been around for several years and is indicated in treating metastatic breast cancer although doctors sometimes choose to use a drug off label the active ingredient in abraxane is paclitaxel known as taxol the difference is that abraxane is paclitaxel which means that there may be less hypersensitivity reaction allergy upon administration otherwise the side effect profile is very similar to that of paclitaxel taxol what may be most helpful is if you can speak with a breast cancer expert at a large academic medical center who can talk specifically about your case the three regimens proposed and what is known in the research that may help you make a decision in all cases benefits must be weighed against risk hi gang again wishiwere i have the same heart problems sob tachycardia and palpitations i have had my cardiac enzymes checked and a muga and everything is ok so why am i having problems do you really have foot or is it just the peeling from chemo taxotere made my feet peel really bad after i got out of the shower i would spend 10 minutes with cuticle scissors just cutting dead skin off my feet thank goodness it has finally cleared up my swollen legs and ankles are just beginning to go down i have not been able to work in my garden for more than 30 min to 1 hours i used to spend hours in it doing heavy stuff now i can barely get a few weeds pulled and i really need to weed but my phlox cherry trees tulips pansies and red buds are all in full bloom the daffodils are finally gone i would really like to get out and enjoy the garden but it has been raining for 3 days and i feel like crap so i just want to stay in bed bc sucks chemo sucks lingering se sucks le sucks people who expect you to be all better right after you last tx suck my constant complaining sucks enough debbie my mo was very supportive of me taking aspirin he said i could take one 81mg in the morning and one in the evening i found myself bruising a lot more with the second one so i dropped it but still take one with my tamoxifen every day also seen some studies that indicated that there was potentially a synergistic relationship of aspirin with tamoxifen in preventing metastases but my mo did state that he think that aspirin would have an impact on the risk of blood clots in the veins dvt which is what tamoxifen is associated with that was somewhat of a surprise since i had assumed that if aspirin was a good preventative for blood clots that it would work the same in a vein as in an artery having my first taxol tomorrow still heard if anyone used ice packs during the tx to reduce nail damage and neuropathy anyone laura i had out of 12 of taxol today one more to go the 12 weeks will go faster than you think after i stop the steroids which will be wed by thursday afternoon i notice weakness fatigue aching in my legs and occasional but numbness and sometimes tingling in my hands or feet i ice both the hands and feet during the dose of taxol which i really think has helped for the neuropathy and for my nails i also get occasional pain and weakness in the knees and ankles my sinuses have been a complete mess since i started but not sure if the taxol or the herceptin i was going stir crazy this past week and decided to clean out a very large section of book shelves all the up and down sitting standing and climbing my legs finally gave out and i fell flat on my face part of that sure is that i have no endurance but part of it i relate to the taxol overall though i have to say definitely better than ac at least no real nausea just queasiness hope this helps hang in there be done before you know it and my hair is growing back very very slowly on the taxol not fast but at least something say that for the brows or lashes yet was supose to have number 11 of 12 taxol yesterday they called and said that my blood counts were too low and that i was done i was on a study and found out that they do not make up missed ones so i got 10 out of 12 and i am done with chemo yay on to rads in january hair is still growing little white spikes and fuzz have a great weekend to all lacey tamoxifen is a very different drug i would give one of the other ais a try with your exercise program i doubt you would experience the same problems like others the amount of joint pain i have is directly related to how much exercise i get mine is aggravated by arthritis but on the whole i find letrozole annoying but tolerable more comfort food tonight chicken and slicks hi spooks i just wondered what side effects you had with exemestane as i am maybe changing from letrozole to that i have had bad joint pain helped slightly by ibuprofen and exercise my cholesterol has also been elevated which is a known side effect unfortunately it is so difficult as i want to take an inhibitor due to being hormone positive i have been on letrozole since march sorry spooks just scrolled down and read your previous post re exemestane love judi we did 12 weeks of taxol and some of the effects were watery eyes and numbness in fingers and toes fatigue was always a factor and there were some aches and pains but generally not as bad os adriamycin and cytoxin 15 weeks never experienced sickness used a naturopathic doctor and am still using one hi lowrider good to hear from you i like your theory i dont think in my case surgery will ever lead to anything the tumor cells responsible for the liquid production i e the ascites dont form proper tumors but just cover everything with kind of a veil the tumor lawn if left to grow the layers will of course get thicker but still how will you operate scrape them off kind of on the other hand if treated early the cell layers are nicely accessible for chemo so i have to trust on that how was your chemo yesterday mine took a total of 9 hours with all the medications and water and zometa and chemos etc i reacted quite strongly to the taxcol even when still at 20 seconds per drop some kind of strange feeling on my lungs and my heart like a pressure so they let the taxol run for 5 hours got a bit frantic staring at the drip but the last two hours where nice i was alone with one nurse who stayed to look after me and we had a very good chat mema sue i am still hoping that i will really just need the three rounds of carbo taxol to avoid the cumulative fatigue that you describe though one good week toward the end of treatment sounds still quite doable but i know that three rounds is very unusual most people get six on the other hand i can tell by my very low weight and very flat tummy that at least at this moment the ascites is completely gone and this after just the first round so i will be waiting for my markers and then decide if i hand them in already to my onco perhaps to have an early scan however i expect they will want to schedule the scan for after the third round makes sense i guess i wonder whether to ask for a different type of scan because the ct this time never showed any of the new growth we could both clearly see on the ultrasound but on the ct just what had been visible for months they always say they dont want to see too much so as not to react too soon but in this case to know whether its gone or still there might make the big difference as to more chemo or not i am quite confident because by now i am pretty good at making them listen to my theories and ideas as i was so often right they probably have to admit i gave them the idea to have me stick to femara while doing chemo which is very unusual but it makes sense in my case and im very relieved they listened the good thing is i have absolutely no side effects now of the femara cant even feel my joints but maybe the chemo cortison has taken care of any light inflammation there migt have been but i am still having my estrogen checked because of these strange peaks of estrogen in my ovary free body but now to you i am so impressed with your fantastic chemo results brilliant in remission no more chemo what else do you want to hear and you can even keep your breasts no surgery no radiation you keep all these weapons for if ever anything comes back very good feeling isnt it but it wont for a very long time especially the herceptin in some people its a wonder drug they stay in remission for years and years met a woman who had had liver lungs and bone mets and every thing was quiet under herceptin for how many years dont remember but she just had her 76 herceptin treatment thank you very much for the tips from your naturapath especially the one for the taste buds only with some of them i wonder if they help against the side effects i e the gluconamide against the neuropathy in your fingers that means they must be impairing the effect of chemo on those cells so how can i be sure the medicine doesnt equally impair the effectiveness of the chemo agents in those places where they should do their job after all these medications work systemically too dont they so i have a tendency of letting the chemo just simply do its job and endure the side effects what do you think dellmonica congratulations wow eat as much as you can and enjoy it i envy you for that alone already love susaloh missy 84 i was on faslodex and a trial drug and my mets grew i was on xeloda for 10 days and ended up in hospital with uncontrollable diarrhea for 9 days now i am on taxol and i will know if i am making any progress next wednesday i do feel better and ha e less pain in my hip and spine there are a lot of rabbits in the hat keep the faith i never did my 2005 tumor was growing like crazy ended up being cm so we did a mastectomy i had chemo every other week four acs then four taxols my first tumor was a rare variety called medullary my second tumor 2007 was idc so it definitely come from the first tumor i had second mastecomy and then 12 weekly taxol carboplatin treatments i found the weekly treatments easier on me than the because the doses were smaller get infusions three fridays in a row then rest a week repeat three times my onc refused to do ac again because i have heart disease in my family there had just been a study about how weekly taxol carbo works especially well for mets why she chose that combo for me even though i have mets my worstside effect on carbo was anemia my red blood cells which carry oxygen went way down and i was exhausted most of the time sometimes i even felt breathless i slept a lot cindymn hi i am a 32 a maybe a b and my lumpectomy did not make a noticable difference in the way my breast looks in addition to the lumpectomy i had an open biopsy on the other side of the same breast i am postmenopausal and on tamoxifen for me i noticed any hair loss i take biotin as my nails are brittle in all likliehood your sugeon will get good margins on the second go around do you know the estrogen status ie was your tumor estrogen positive usually you take tamoxifen or an ai unless you are estrogen positive the nuclear grade does refer to how fast the cells are growing and how different they look from normal cells the homepage for this site has a link to aritlces which will help you understand your diagnosis and pathology report the ladies on this board are great at answering questions and explaing everything good luck i know a lot of women take claritan when they get neulasta a white blood cell booster given 24 hours after chemo it helps with the bone pain from claritan recently read that some are taking it for the side effects of aromatase inhibitors too they are an medication given to er pr women for 5 years following chemo i think that read anywhere about taking it during chemo but i could be mistaken good luck with your first chemo it was the scariest because i know what to expect but also the easiest it what i expected at all much easier my infusion center gave the in this order drugs steroids benedryl then the chemo meds they gave taxotere carboplatin then herceptin they like to give them in that order so that should you have a reaction easier for them to tell what from since the taxotere is the most likely to cause a reaction they give it first no though reactions are extremely rare and the staff knows how to handleanyissues letthem know if youfeel weird during the infusions the steroids canmake you feel hyper then they give you the benedryl and you feel sleepy the taxotere made my eyes run and my cheeks flush the carboplatin i could taste and the herceptin i could smelll kind of weird first night of tamoxifen i woke up at 330 am possibly from anxiety second night last night i slept for 10 hrs i was so tired i felt like i washed 12 cars by hand but i think it was from being sleepless the previous night but otherwise everything is good i normally wear a watch but since so forgetful in taking medicine i bought a tiny wrist watch with alarm to remind me time to take my tamoxifen i takemine after lunch i like that idea about aspirin also gonna email my mo about it i had a 8 mm idc tumor lumpectomy chemo oncotype was 26 radiation and then aromasin i started aromasin on may 31 2009 my joint pain has been steadily increasing and i have been feeling increasingly worse i have a variety of other side effects as well i have developed gerd due to the amount of ibuprofen i was taking today my onc said i should consider switching to tamoxifen it took a little soul searching but i finally decided to swtich she said there was only a difference in the effectiveness of tamoxifen she said i need to wait to start the tamoxifen so i am going to take it tonight she said it would take weeks to start feeling better i am 59 and went throught menopause at 50 i would love to hear from others who switched and what side effects they experienced each and every person reacts differently to medication so for those of you just starting aromasin a good chance you experience side effects bc is a very personal journal but i have made it this far without the advice from you wonderful group of ladies log in to post a reply crafty the first round of any chemo it tough because you know what se you will get once you know you can medicate before it happens the heartburn constipation and back pain were the worst with tx 1 on taxotere once i knew when and what i treated before i had the issue vary rarely does one have vomiting nausea that be controlled with meds the ones you had obviously the right ones for you there are many different ones but other are more so some mds prescribe be sure to demand something better hang in there hi there i need some advice from you i was diagnosed with metastic breast cancer january 04 mets to liver in only one area had lumpectomy chemo adriamycin and taxotere and radiation follow up scan showed lesion in liver gone put into menopause chemically and took arimadex and then switched to aromasin because of neck pain 2006 had a bilateral oopherectomy prophylactic in march 07 ct showed that the lesion in my liver had returned i have scans every 3 months so chemo avastin xeloda and taxol and then a liver resection have been doing great since then weight down exercise daily feel wonderful pet scan last week showed any area lit up in my chest mri showed a probable lymph node behind my trachea next to my esophagus anterior to my spine seeing my oncologist today who has taken the last two days to digest the news and come up with a plan of action i love my onc and have complete faith in her just wondering if there is anything anyone would do been getting faslodex monthly for the past two years guess that working now is there a way of checking your estrogen level i know it is still produced in the adrenal glands and i have minimal fat tissue er pr her 2nu any suggestions would be greatly appreciated log in to post a reply hi amy work i took 2 wks off for the left mastectomy i had six months of chemo 4 ac three weeks apart then 12 weekly taxols i was very careful to take all the anti nausea meds exactly as instructed and no i never really got sick i would come home from chemo pretty much go to bed then get up in the am and go to work i work 6 am 3 pm so did chemo after work i was just lucky it all worked out logistically and really blessed to have such supportive bosses by the time i was into taxol i was very fatigued i had my husband take over all the errands shopping etc i went straight home from work relaxed on the couch did dinner in bed by 8 or 9 i need to stress though that i have a desk job i think key to figure out how physical your job is before you decide what to do i could not have done a very physical job just did not have much energy towards the end nursing or teaching for example would be much harder i do travel a lot for business but not during the spring which was when i had chemo it all just worked out i loved being treated normally at work it was the only place where i felt myself it was very good for me psychologically but that is very individual and you need to make your own choice just know in your heart that you will be ok trust your instincts hope that helps good luck and ask any questions you want melia tappy scary because you know what to expect be surprised after you get through the first treatment that it will have seemed much less scary than you thought it would be fear of the unknown is always the worst but then probably heard that a time or two by now let me address your questions as best i can you have scripts for nausea get those filled so that you have them on hand when you get home from your first treatment they are for nausea which may happen in those first few days afterwards you will receive some the day of treatment i got decadron aloxi iv and emend an hour before getting my first chemo infusion i also received an hour of iv hydration you will probably get something very similar some docs use iv zofran instead of the aloxi if you get emend you will have a packet with two more pills to take for the following two mornings my meds were compazine and ativan i rarely needed them yes i also wore a scopolamine patch i applied it the morning of treatment and then wore it for three or four more days depending on how i was feeling it will make you very thirsty which means you will drink more liquids not a bad thing as it keeps you well hydrated most important i took claritin to ward off bone pain from the neulasta shot i took one the morning i was receiving the shot and for three mornings afterwards it worked for me and you can just get the generic version of plain claritin you need the d version as i mentioned before i had a script for ativan i tried using it for sleep and i think it did much to help me there i had a couple of times when i took it in the afternoon because i was feeling a little nauseous and it helped me take a nap once or twice some people say it knocks them out i never had a problem with constipation or diarrhea some people do have issues and i think an individual thing i had bought stool softeners and meds and never opened the bottle if you use pain meds you might need a softener after my first ac treatment i started using generic prilosec at night i noticed the heartburn and my esophagus was irritated it helped a lot when i started taxol i added generic pepcid i received iv pepcid as a before taxol and i asked about that why one over the other apparently we have different acid producers proton pumpers and taxol irritates the one that responds best to pepcid so i took both of them during taxol i had an immediate problem with mouth sores herpes simplex after the first treatment my doctor wrote a script for generic valtrex i will stay on it until i am six months past radiation my body happens to like to produce cold sores when it is stressed or fighting off a virus so the valtrex took care of the problem and i never had any problem with mouth sores afterwards many people swear by biotene products toothpaste and mouthwash i like the taste of it and now there are several mouthwashes that are and help soothe a dry mouth i liked version the best i used my usual toothpaste without a problem what else whatever makes you comfortable you will experience dry mouth and i just kept drinking i leave the house even now without a container full of ice water some people like gum hard candies mints whatever there is a discussion thread for october 2011 chemo gals i recommend you check that out have the benefit of the experiences of everyone who has

expect and it may relieve a few fears good luck to you as you go kick butt michelle chemo and other meds can affect your eye health tamoxifen can cause cataracts but is very rare for that to happen i have vision changes from chemo and tamoxifen made my eys dry my eye dr gave me drops to moisturize them conjunctivitis can cause dry eye irritation i hope things improve for you over the weekend and that fatigue also was the culprit glad you are enjoying your children they are such a wonderful gift from god hugs dawn hi all i have been lurking on this thread for a long time now and think i should finally join in i was dx with both primary and secondary lung mets back in april last year and it would seem like everyone else this has sent me helter skelter on a research trip like no other i have found reading survival stories to be a great help in building my positive attitude also writing all the mountains of information down in a blog has helped me to make sense of the advice knowledge out there on this subject sort of put some order into the chaos i have found reading bernie book love medicine and miracles to be a great great help also the wonderful kris carr of crazy sexy diet a true inspiration my latest recomend for a read is by debbie shapiro called your body speaks your mind this book so far is brilliant a bit like the louise haye book you can heal yourself stress and depression are tricky to deal with especially if you are naturally highly strung you cant change who you are you are what you are i have found various complimentary treatments to be a great help spiritual healing acupuncture reflexology and massage all help to relax you and in tend to treat the se problems i was experiencing like hot flushes brought on by chemo and exasperated by tamoxifen migraines constant constipation fatigue and the latest one is achey limbs the se alone cause depression and i have found by reminding myself of this it sort of nips the depression in the bud before it can get a hold of me a good clearing out of your emotional dirty laundry is a tremendously good thing i have recently flushed away a couple of supposed friendships that were so so negative for me in particular a girl friend who when i was first dx told me that bc was a punishment from god she said this too me in the same week i was told i had lung mets also like to add supposed to be an atheist who needs enemys when you have friends like that so be clear get rid sending you all love and lightsarahlou 1967 i also had dd ac followed by dd taxolfrom october of2005 through february of 2006 feeling great no s other than chemo brain my memory is horrible my life is one big post it note i know not doing this anymore why they what are they doing instead pam on taxol 12 today i do get the tingling and numbness been using 15grams twice a day for 4 days i take it for 4 days after chemo it seems to help me i still have a little of the tingling numbness but it improved with buttoning clothes and opening jars and things been a rough couple of weeks everyone at work are on pins and needles what the hospital system is going to do with my small community hospital the have been slowly dismantling the hospital by departments last week i was told by my manager that my program is definitely on the chopping block i feel just a matter of time if the program is axed staff members will be losing their jobs to make matter worse the staff has turned on each other in order to save themselves there is a great deal of back stabbing going on trying to deal with chemo and se pending surgery to exchange my te and with work i slept in days if i have hair be pulling out these days glad some of you are done with chemo and having the ports out be getting my port out in nov dec after next weeks taxol i have 6 months of herceptin her 2 every 3 weeks the good news was my mo rechecked on my test and pathology reports and reaffirmed that i don not need rads i just read the article the globe mail i feel gratitudeto the continued pressure by the women who have suffered a truly devastating result to their the taxotere treatment regimen the way i see it is that not only do they have to suffer the feeling of the disfigurement of permanent hair loss but when they try to get some redressby calling attention to this potential result thatmay benefit others whendiscussing treatment options they have often been belittled and treated dismissively bymany in the medicalcommunity and women like ourselves who who should show some compassion and gratitude i think these women especially shirleyl and okblessed should be admired for their tenacity inthis fight for more accurate information from drug companies and caregivers tonyai had bone mets and liver mets tch really gave me a ton of bone pain with my hips being the worst i had hip and rib mets and both areas hurt really bad i would look like alittle old lady getting up after sitting all stiff and in pain but i was ned after only 3 cycles so pain gain herceptin still kicks my butt a little bit with the bone pain and joint issues it is all worth it jennifer trinity i did ac and taxol with the shots pretty much tazzy nailed everything in her post everyone is different and the horrible things we went through may never happen to you chemo was ok for me i just took all my meds and definetly with ac drink lots of water 2 times i ended up in the hospital with bladder spasms from not drinking enough i was so tired that i even realize i drinking enough make sure you have someone force down those liquids for you i remembered being so tired after surgery and then started chemo our bodies can do it but its a big challenge be fine i was 37 when i was and glad now that i went through the whole chemo thing and they treated it aggressively the shots were hard on me because they help your body make more wbc and that was painful on my bones there is meds to help and i did a lot of walking also to stretch my bones for me ac aka red devil at least what we called it was the hardest to get through and made me feel the sickest taxol on the other hand was a complete switch i felt better with taxol but taxol cause bone pain tingling in your hand and feet so taxol with shots sucks but like i said there is pain killers to help make sure you ask for them i have much tingling of my hands and feet just the first and second day after chemo and the tingling was light i never got a metallic taste in my mouth or mouth sores i was just careful what i ate and how much of it example i eat foods that were hard and could scratch inside of my mouth and i always stayed away from acidy fruits like pineapples which would give me sores as you go a long with chemo you have your days of testing what is best for you and not for you port a tricky question i had my port placed with my first surgery and then i started chemo i made it through chemo but did have problems off and on with the port not flushing and giving me other problems at my last chemo my whole right arm was in so much pain from my port that a week later the nurses wanted me to have it flush and they get anything my body started rejecting the port and i was in so much pain so my mom took me to er and she yelled at the docs to ripe it out they got my surgeon who put it in and he took me to his office and they removed it in one of his procedure room he said putting it in is harder than taking it out just for my experience i would tell them to do it at the hospital hope i covered everything if not let me know and answer more questions you may have get some rest dawn brenda i may be there right with you my doc want to put in another port because of my dvt issues they have seemingly cleared up after the port was removed but i guess now at high risk for getting another the groin will be the only other place they can put in a port not so cool at my infusion center where there are no private rooms and everyone sits in a i start adriamycin next wed and my veins are so shot no one ever gets me with only one stick i highly recommend three weeks on one off with avastin and abraxane get the avastin on weeks 1 and 3 much easier on you body and for me i really need any premeds my nausea was slight and i managed to treat it with ativan and ginger ale although my hair did fall out it started growing back while i was still on a a not enough so i looked like i had a punk do because it was thin and more sparse than normal hair occasionally i required an aranesp shot for red cell count but never neopogen nor neulasta i know just how you feel about losing your hair again crap crap crap however i hope your new treatment kicks butt swampy i just take immodium and had my carboplatin adjusted xantac for the acid reflux i just had another of those dizzy spells got up too quick from the couch got dizzy real quick and fell on the floor scraped my knees i wait until this is over mention this dizziness again tomorrow at chemo the decadron keeps me awake i sleep for 2 nights with it all i can think is 2 more infusions 2 more infusions i hope the pet comes back clear take much more of this crap love to escape to a resort cruise anywhere i was 44 when diagnosed i was heavily amplified her 2neu so chemo was a given for my case no getting out of it and no oncotype testing was not even done since i already had a high incidence rate of recurrence hanging over my head after i finished chemo i began tamoxifen and endured a miserable 6 months i could no longer take the side effects the leg and foot cramps where my feet would contorted and i could not walk or sleep i determined that i absolutely could not live like that for 5 years i only say this to say that tamoxifen is not always tolerable for every woman and you must keep that in mind i would give it a try but realize it too has side effects and there is no way to predict if they can be tolerated for the full 5 years lupron injections or ovary removal is another option chemo for me introduced life threatening mrsa infections that required hospitalization and surgery which left horrible scars and i never would have done it chemo had it not been absolutely required for me these infections occurred 6 months after chemo my immune system was ruined by chemo some theorize that it is the immune system that plays into developing a breast cancer diagnosis in the first place i developed an intestinal 2 years later that make it impossible for me to absorb nutrients through diet i have to go for monthly shots i am weak and tired a lot of the time i also developed scarring in my esophagus which had to be surgically removed twice 2 years after chemo ended the doctors told me that chemo ate up my intestinal tract and this scarring was an effect of that since those surgeries i can keep food down once again thankfully i tell you all of this to scare you but only to say that you really have a choice of the lesser of two evils and there is no easy way to decide these are serious complications that can and do happen to patients they may be rare but nobody could predict them for me i guess you have to ask yourself how much you personally can live with not for just the 4or5 months of chemo but for the rest of your life because they can and do last a lifetime 1 i had only abou 25 loss at day 21 with shedding i ended up with a bald spot from my first cold cap due to frostbite then from day 21 it was a very steady stream of heavy shedding when i started taxol i was about 75 hair loss and then from there alot of breakage 2 my hair was very very thick now u can see my scalp all over lol i look like linus from peanuts 3 because of the thickness of my hair my caps were 33 defrees started 50 minutes before and after 4 no supplements until recently 5 on ac i ended up with some heart releated issues i would feel like a big mac hit me saturday and sunday especially after my darn friday neulasta my counts hit the crapper and i ended up sick at which time i ended up staying home for a month till ac was done i am a paramedic i work on an ambulance as well as in the hospital so i took a hiatus i took round 8 of taxol yesterday only some very mild neuropathy to my tootsies but it is only when i am on then foe 12 solid my counts are going up and i feel decent on taxol the big this i want to stress to you is that you may be one of the lucky ones who the caps work well on with this regmin keep in mind that thinning is expected and would i do it over again probably good luck try not to stress over it keep your hands out of your hair hi lorimar after my tx of taxoter cytoxan on probably the second to third day after my lymph nodes in my neck and armpits hurt really badly i goes away after a day or so is this what happened to you i also get the neulasta shot but i think the lymph pain is from the taxotere i do believe though that the neulasta shot can causea reaction of a horrible headache you should let you doctor know of the headache a friend of mine went through horrible headaches after the neulasta her doctor determined that it was a reaction to the neulasta tc trial 2007 i too suffer from the most horrible bone pain after my tc treatments i believe though this is worsend by the neulasta shot that i receive do you receive the neulasta shot after your tx if you do i have been told that clariton will help with the pain and i plan on taking that on my next tx which is thursday october 17 glad to hear from both of you ladies laurie surprised your onc said the only se on abraxane is hair loss neuropathy can be a major side effect and devastating the fatigue is no joke either as far as nausea or chemo brain not bad i spent 10 months on abraxane and it kept me stable or maybe even a little improvement but i must say because of the neuropathy issues become very depressed i am in serious pain in my hands and feet all the times and very clumsy nothing has eased that pain still after a month out told in some cases the neuropathy never clears up ever the hair loss was very upsetting 4th time as well been through all the chemos available to me so stopping abraxane because of the side effects was a very hard decision sorry for the rant but your comment was so uninforming for you it quite upset me my onc started me on 75mg of effexor for depression i was having since starting on tamoxifen he said this would also help with hot flashes which i think has helped some you may want to ask for a prescription and see if it helps the hot flashes and night sweats are not fun i had my 2nd tx on thursday so far everything is going well less anxious this time around do notice that i get tired more frequent and my energy level drops hair loss it started on monday before memorial day weekend by sat it was pretty much gone after i washed it have not shave it all i am wearing mainly scarfs and i like them alot the little hair leftgives the appearance that i havehair underneath i did order 2 wigs just have to find the one that suits you try them on first my first one came from a catalogue and it was too dark i got a newone short and not my hair style at all it makes me look modern what the heck i am in great spirits ready to embrace this i was so afraid of the hair loss now that is here i am just alternating between hats long wig shirt wig and scarf want to get stuck w only one thing now that summer is comming i feel scarves are less intimidating for others that know what i am going through i know it screams cancer but heck that is what i am right now in my life i have had to update my ward robe to make it go w my scarves i feel i look like a gipsy and i am playing up the part it gets easier a few days after the hair falls off the anxiety of waiting for it to fall off is worse tamoxifen blood clots i have lupus and the blood cluta are true w tamoxifen i already have an anticouagulant factor and therefore the may send me into early menopause and cheange my hormome therapy there are blood tests that can be perform to see if you already have predisposition to clots i came back positive for it my onco did not pay much attention to it until my lupus dr ran the testing have a great sunday just stopping by to say hello to all the tammi girls and let you know i am thinking of you have my mo appt in 10 or 11 days am sure we will discuss the tamoxifen issue again have been feeling so much better off of it only complaints are continued neuropathy fatigue so we will see hugs to all of you jo so glad you are doing well after all the drama paula sherry dt openheart schipmom and everyone else have a good weekend and keep cool i had my first taxol last week i feel pretty good my back hurt last weekend but i think i was just constipated three more to go and i scheduled my exchange surgery today for april 12 i swear my hair is growing too i can see the light at the end of this tunnel how much is a half regular dose of effexor i am taking mg of effexor and started it about a month before the tamoxifen 20mg both at the end of 2008 i had sleep problems and nausea from the effoxor in the beginning but that settled before i started the tamoxifen about days a week i feel a bit queasy and off know if the meds emotional upset or what but i can live with it theresanne when i was first diagnosed i had two lumpectomies and since that work a mastectomy oh boy that seems like ages ago i had chemo forgot which one honestly dose dense for four treatments and then tamoxifen for five years i guess the cancer took up house again after being off treatment for a year i have joint pain yet but had plenty on tamoxifen good luck to you you sound like you are doing quite well outside of the joint pain i hope that keeps up for you blessings thank you for your kind thoughts oh i just keep running through life in fact getting ready to wash some windows while the weather is decent look into boitin linda i am so happy for you this result is awesome did they switch you from letrozole if so was it not responding i am on the letrozole palbociclib or placebo so far not much response and i have been so sick for 2 months with nausea and cant really eat much solo of course down to 120 from 160 began combo on scans due dec 5 my fingers are crossed but after reading possess like the allowed seems like it is hopeful also they have me on water restriction due to severe sodium loss been of palo for two weeks because of this sorry to rant on but i did want to congratulate you on your continued success i have also been diagnosed with tye 2diabetes sonoma wonderi if the metformin is causing nausea cant get bp under control either today ugh well ladies been dealing with my only side effect of the tamoxifen so far constipation have never had a problem before so miserable went and talked to the pharmacist about taking miralax he said be fine and to take it in the morning so what be doing tomorrow i just wanted to make sure that be no interactions between the effexor tamoxifen or even the vitamin d went with my hubby this morning to watch my daughter get sworn in to the federal bar in maryland a very proud moment for us vikki i thought i was being so tidy and organized with my list of 10 side effects then remembered a couple more fewer of us seem to be on taxotere following ac than are on taxol so i think this thread is useful 11 sore mouth tongue and throat i know if the swishing or pure dumb luck but so far escaped without mouth sores 12 know how i could have forgotten this one constipation not sure if from taxotere itself or from the aloxi in my drip but there hard to know whether or how to treat it because after a couple of days inevitably followed by diarrhea there that makes it an even dozen linda vision 4utoo thanks for sharing your story with us i am so sorry you are having so much pain i am with you on that i am still in the recon process should have my last fill in 2 weeks and then exchange i aalso have fibromyalgia which with the tamoxifen is excruciating pain is a hard thing to deal with everyday sounds like you have more than your share it also sounds like you have a great attitude about it all you are right about your babies would rather have you in a chair than not have you i tell myself the same thing when my son wants me to do something that i just do anymore i am so thankful to still be here with him even if i have to tell him no he is what gets me up everyday and keeps me pushing forward please come here if you ever need to vent or just know someone cares and is in the same boat as you i thank you all for being here susan i take femara and also had the ringing buzzing in the ear it comes and goes and my pcp told me that if you look at all the side effects there but like 0002 and i get the dizziness but only in my exercise classes i do a class called body pump and when laying down and i turn my head sideways to look at the instructor i get the dizziness and also when i do yoga i get it but if i just turn my head straight and close my eyes it dissapates been on arimidex for a year after using tamoxifen for two years my worst day with arimidex is better than tamoxifen i do get hot flashes esp after i eat not so much during the night i do have joint pain and i too have issues when i first stand up i have to walk off the stiffness my hands ache esp when i have a psoriasis i had a total hysterectomy in feb natural menopause has been much better than menopause knock on wood i had any weight gain hi kathi like the spelling of your name as well as mine lol sorry you had those s with aromasin but thank you for posting i hope the femara and effexor continues to help you a bit i have the dizziness bone pain losing balance or pain in bones but yeah my feet hurt but they did before the aromasin fingers hurt but not intolerable hot flashes night sweats since slammed into chemopause with first dose of taxol never abated thru tamoxifen for 3 years now aromasin good luck to you your 02 is worth everything juli am on the oral cytoxan 14 days each regimen and get the other in infusions on the 1st and 8th day of each regimen i then get 14 days off i started losing my hair after week 3 one day it was fine and the next it was coming out by the handfuls it was devistating i then lost my nose hairs which really sucks because i have a sinus infection along with an ear infection i have not lost the hair on my legs though bummer pupic hairs are just about gone no need for a bikini wax this summer i had a lot of nausea the first round but not much since i do have to pee all the dam time though it really irritates the bladder i am tired but sleep how crazy is that how are you feeling so far if you posted it earlier sorry i am so far behind i have been working a lot and just keep up i have 3 more regimens to go after this one so i am guessing around oct 17th i will be done how long is your chemo for i posted about this sometime back and did get some responses but it was really only today that both the pa i saw and a patient i was next to in the treatment room gave me some info i found extememly informative and am passing it on to you who may still have the problem i was told that the chemo caused the tear ducts to close off am not sure if they clog up or what but they are no longer able to release the tears they they then pool up in the eye have nowhere to go so the eye overflows and the treas go running out of the eyes this makes sense to me the bad news is that they can reverse it or get them back to normal without surgery only if you go have it checked out by an opthamologist early on when i told this woman in the teratment room i thought it had been over a month she said oh if it had only been two months or so i could probably have something done non surgical otherwise what they do is put a wire in the tear duct and leave it there sounds painful but you are under a local outpatient and dont feel it and she said after the wire does not bother you and you dont feel it or if this fails which it did for her then you have a stint put in and it goes down the side of the nose she has had two of these cuz i guess a lot of things go wrong on this woman she was just so nice to talk to and i hope to run into her again since she goes once a week also she now gets avastin which she has been on for years and faslodex and i think herceptin she said taxotere was the one that did this to her eyes and also caused her nails to fall off and caused her to almost starve cuz food tastes soooo bad to her anyway i have an appt with the opthamalogist on wed but his nurse said she think he does either procedure and will probably refer me out so i am to call friday when he is back in town and find out maybe this info will help someone else with the problem whenever i would mention it to my onco and i know i also told the other pa they both said it if from the chemo and never told me that you could possibly do something about it also i am rather pissed that my onco did not tell me the neuropathy could be permanant the pa today told me that if i feel the side effects are too bad we can always take a break or stop them but i agreed to do the 24 and that is only two more now so i think i can make it i just pray the neuropathy go into that foot drop she was telling me about guess that makes it really difficult to walk anyway just wanted to let you all know marybe i am so touched that you found strength here i dont know what i would have done without these women still run here to read and post all the time all the ups and downs here we are all in it togethor our common bond is so strong we all get it its a safe place i hope you will continue to come and share with us so i havent been posting here very much but i do read almost daily i have been in a funk 1 month post rads actually over a month i am exhausted and cranky no interest in anything i feel a bit better today but the past couple weeks have been rough mentally mostly i did start taking the tamoxifen but i abandoned on sunday it as really upsetting my stomache and making me worse not sure if its psychological or not i do plan on taking it as i am not scared not to do it ugh all the decisions we have to make i just want the bc gods to come down and show me the way much love to you all claire gail lily i hope you 3 are well you continue to inspire one of the brigade my ability to multitask is gone and my short term memory is affected by anastrozole those two things along with serious joint pain and reduced stamina even 3 years down the road from diagnosis would have made continuing on in my profession unwise for both me and my patients loving retirement so take early retirement as a complaint from me it was just fortunate that i was able to afford to retire a year early i checked into these boards in a long time i just had a second revision of my right breast last wednesday that makes four surgeries for this journey plus a fifth surgery for a tubal endometrial biopsy and ovarian cyst removal i feel like an expert surgery patient put my iv there versed in preop you betcha tough being a nurse because i need a lot of info still but i want them to give it to me in too simple of terms i get impatient when they start explaining things like the pain scale i teach nursing and all of the experiences i have had are definitely making their way into the classroom my students hear about my experiences and we talk about what they might do better one of the biggest frustrations for me is the lack of knowledge about taking bps on those of us that have had a bilateral mx and nodes on both sides does no one have a thigh cuff do they not understand why the calf is a bad location i feel like i should mount a campaign to educate our fellow nurses on how to care for us i fell and broke my arm last sept and the er have a thigh cuff or a manual cuff i can be talked into a manual if they pump it up too high crazy the tamoxifen is ok hot flashes come and go worst when i am lecturing or in with patients and students i am drenched after michelle also doing dd 4x a c 4x taxol my from the a c were the same as experiencing i am also working through treatment and on some days it was extremely difficult to get myself going the emend helped a great deal with the nauseau but the fatigue and overall feeling of crud lasted forever now doing taxol and today i had tx 3 and much easier no nausea at all i had a lot of muscle and bone pain with 1 2 but ibuprofen helped my pain usually starts around day 3 and lasts days my oncologist suggested taking advil before the pain starts and stick with it round the clock so far no problems with my nails and i only have mild tingling in my hands i find that running them under cold water really helps one of the toes on my right foot is a little numb but not too bad been taking about 2 gms of a day which is supposed to help with the neuropathy good luck let me know how it goes for you i think getting the dose dense tx really does seem to go by quickly i am also trip neg is the avastin a trial doing guessing it probably is my oncologist did not mention it to me elaine omaz i was told at the time of treatment and now volunteer at the cancer infusion center and hear frequently that the steroids were to help mainly with allergic reactions to the taxotere second with nausea though it can cause nausea also then things like swelling etc pbrain i had emend the day before of and after chemo i also received it iv i was given a couple more nausea drugs iv one was aloxi but remember what they were then was given compazine and ativan for nausea at home the compazine worked really well the few times i got nauseous if those drugs work i was supposed to call the office and they would get me some different drugs i had the prilosec because i had really awful heartburn i constipated but did have a lot of diarrhea someone pmed about this thread i guess now famous for gross nails great this happened to me on taxotere it is a se but rare especially to get it as bad as i did my nails started to hurt first then lifted blood darkening underneath several also occurred many of them oozed smelly stuff some did bleed a little too it was pretty disgusting i did have to get one toenail removed a few others fell off for some reason i loose any of my fingernails although every single one lifted there was a point where i could only wear my big combat boot type shoes because all my other shoes put pressure on the toenails making it difficult to walk at some point my fingernails all hurt too one time my thumb actually was throbbing even now some of my fingernail beds are still a little tender i still use most of my nails to scrape labels off yet they are much better now and growing out toenails still look like crap but much better tomorrow try and take pictures and update this post 1 more thing try to use them as little as possible every time you put pressure on them you stress the more my podiatrist told me this be sure to tell your onc about this i think it was a big deal when it started i told her about my toes and she wanted to see she sent me to a podiatrist i also saw a dermatologist for the fingers just to make sure they infected finger pictures this is when it started i do have clear nai polish on linky 1 black nail polish on one finger became swollen but no infection note the date is feb 12th but i had my last chemo on jan 18th linky 2most of the nail polish is off now you can see some nails do have blood dark underneath finger no longer swollen feb 21st linky 3 toe pictures clear nail polish on toes bit nail lifted with whitish stuff underneath it was draining smelly stuff too toe linky 1this is the gross pictures the black on the toe is not polish that is underneath the skin on my toes also dried out on chemo toe linky 2any other questions feel free to ask update photos from today fingers toes i had a bilateral mast in dec very small tumor no lymph involvement the only recommended treatment if at all was tamoxifen which i decided to do about 2 weeks after starting it i began getting swallowing problems irritated mouth dry mouth etc my dentist says dry mouth and blamed it on the tamox my oncology nurse says it is not a typical side effect of tamox my issues change daily i get cankor sores in my mouth chapped lips a crackly tongue etc it makes it hard to talk a lot and to sleep anybody else experienced this as a result of tamox wondering whether something different it does fit the symptoms of dry mouth but quite awful i chew sugarless gum suck on sugarless candy drink a lot but it still persists thanks kathie i see you had taxotere i also had this and finished 8 months ago joint pain and aches are a very common se of this chemo i felt a lot of pain just trying to stand up after sitting even sleeping was difficult as i dreaded just changing my position in bed but now i have to say probably about better it happened quite quickly about 6 weeks ago i noticed that i as achey and moving around was much easier hang in there it will get better you have come this far i back down now as far as hormone tx triple neg and wish i had the benefit of being able to throw something else at reducing the possibility of mets se are mostly temporary i would at least try it and see how you react we are all different just know that the aches you feel now will more than likely leave as time passes happy new year amy i wasnt even given a choice of supressing my ovaries or not my onc actually had a second opinion with a very respected onc professor too feels that being so young and highly est ve i am 95 ve is a given for ovarian supression they both actually told me than having zoladex is overall easier on your body than tamoxifen alone since you hormones just plummet and stay down rather than go up and down as they can with tamoxifen i also questioned why i should be taking tamox and not armidex if i am basically menopausal anyway and was given some explanation but thanks to my chemo brain i remember what it was bones protection pm me if you want to chat more about that stuff good luck whatever you decide anyway just wanted to tell you that zoladex is doable got no side effects apart from mild hot flashes also i was def told we can stop the injections in two years should i decide to try for kids vivre is is so refreshing to read your post thank you so much for taking the time to write what you did i was on tamoxifen for one month and just went off of it 4 days ago my oncologist said to let my body rest before my appt in 6 weeks which is what i plan on doing on tamoxifen i had overall anxiety heart racing nervousness desperate depression and more i am 50 years old and have never been depressed a day in my life before now my body is just all messed up on this drug the only other medication i take is armour for my hypothyroidism which had for about 20 years you mentioned your bodies deficiencies how do i know what my deficiencies are i am going to start walking again i used to walk 4 miles a day but stopped about 5 years ago that might make me feel better i like your approach and your attitude i just wait for this tamoxifen to get out of my body i feel like poisoning me and i want to add anti depressants to my daily intake my recurrence risk is very low even without the tamoxifen so going to try to talk my oncologist no meds again thank you for your help robyn i agree done abraxane yet but xeloda really that bad i did 2 9 month courses of it the first one gave me a whole year before progression and the second one only gave me 3 months w o meds so we take it any further now on doxil same as adriamycin but or liposomal so far after 5 tx very easy although the dose was reduced a bitlast tx due to mouth sores no trouble after dosage reduction and it looks like i am staying with faslodex thanks jill for the good word on zeloda my original oncologist is back from her own cancer adventure she went out on medical leave just as i was found to be stage iv talk about leaving in a lurch and is certain that we will continue to have a long long relationship i certainly hope so so to back track a bit i saw my plastic surgeon at the end of december just after i had a bone scan and ct my appointment with him was just before my appointment with my substitute oncologist he went over the results and scheduled my case to be reviewed by the tumor board tb suggested while there was progression it was mild that faslodex may take time to start showing results there could be mild uptake in the disease before positive results are seen their recommission was to stay on faslodex till my next evaluation in may substitute oncologist was not in agreement felt the drug should be showing improvement by january also the tm have been creeping up from 30s to 50s he suggested zeloda i went ahead with what i thought world be my last injections so now original oncologist is back she at first was going to change prodigal but thought zoleda was not the way to go yet after checking with the tb she is a member and reviewing the scans and tests tm are now in the 60s she feels i should give faslodex more time and will look at were i am in may at the next evaluation if i do change drugs she wants to go back to arimadex sorry about spelling a drug i did not do well on at all i hiked down the grand canyon when i started that drug for a 2 night stay at the phantom ranch and had the hardest time hiking out my ankles and feet were so swollen and continued to swell till i convinced all it was due to arimidex the other drug to revisit would be exemestane i was on that for only three months substitute oncologist took me off that when i started faslodex in between whose two was tamoxifen 2 years and that my have been the drug that failed and lead me to where i am now so what i have learned while i do not know about re visiting faslodex as treatment there is new evidence that going back to previous used hormonal treatment is and can be a option is some casesi have gained some weight with faslodex but my hair is thick and strong the nails look goods too 4 years ago i was bald so if i exercised instead of sitting on my butt i could be hot but no my hiking down the grand canyon days are over i think sex oh yeah i want it but the body is hesitant husband is afraid i may break so snuggle cuddle and make out like teenagers old school teens works for now warm the syringe in your hands before they shoot you up lay down and relax for the shots if you can heating pad and rub the lumps to dissipate the bumps have someone to hold your hand and rub the lumps if you can think good thoughts but imaging the cancer being blown up killed and squished like a bug is perfectly acceptable all the best to each of you may our cancers die long long before we dohappy valentines day to all tish dee i had ac every two weeks for 4 weeks then taxol every two weeks for 4 weeks i had my 3rd taxol one infusion to go yippee not much nausea with the had an infusion before the chemo along with a steroid decadron i was given emend a prescription to take the day of infusion and for two days after also decadron tablets for three days after the infusion ativan and anxiety helped a at night compazine do much for me mouth sores can happen on the ac and eating popsicles or fudgsicles while they do the push helps the adriamycin they give by injecting it into the iv over the course of minutes and yes when my hair started to fall out my head was sore it all sounds daunting but take it one day at a time one step at a time drink lots of fluids it really helps flush and even start drinking a couple days before your transfusion to be sure well hydrated keep us posted cheryl my last infusion will be june 3rd hi margaret a doc with a crxp attitude for sure i take tamoxifen because of hormonal history and have been on letrozole for best part of a year and have all the sore and stiff joints my heels are the most often painful hands are mostly just in the morning and i get very stiff if i sit for any length of time i had 7 sessions of acupuncture which seemed to help but i think this may not be a good idea if you have lymphoedema i have thought about asking for a change but changed my mind when i read the study that suggested that the pain stiffness side effects mean the pills are working love to have no side effects but then fret that the pills being effective best of luck with whatever you end up on s x hello friends sincerely appreciate any advice and guidance you can provide me in my situation here is a chronology of my situation april 2011 30 years old diagnosed with breast cancer biopsy reveals 6 cm no that is not a typo dcis in right breast only mm microinvasive cells may 2011 surgery mastectomy right breast diep flap 18 hour procedure june 2012 surgery infected flap june 2012 surgery removal of flap i am her 2 estrogen dirty margins which my doctors at the time did not mention to me i was 30 years old very active days a week very thin size 0 no famiy history of breast cancer or any cancer at all in every way my health was perfect except of course for the cancer no chemo no radiation no tamoxifen the doctor at the time did suggest tamoxifen but i chose not to take it because i was scared july 2012 the cancer comes back it is all invasive it spread to the chest wall and is in the lymphatic system and vascular system august 2012 surgery unclear margins september 2012 surgery unclear margins october november 2012 radiation for 35 days incuding a week long boost november 2012 start tamoxifen my doctors in 2011 seemed very concerned about being sued i had three surgeries in 7 days there were a number of problems the nurses suggested i speak with a lawyer that is how bad it was the president of the hospita came to see me while i was recuperating from my third surgery i am happier with my team in 2012 they too acknowledged that my past team made a number of errors in my case specifically about not telling me about the dirty margins which mean that the cancer would come back and that even if i had taken tamoxifen at that point it would have only delayed the recurrance not prevented it right now where at i am taking tamoxifen i do not want to take tamoxifen already i have abdominal pain pelvic pain vaginal discharge and irritation sad depressed mood and a general malaise also a size 6 even though i work out as much as i used to and eat the same way i used to this the crux of the problem but i pretend that nothing either i am deeply worried about the side effects been only a week and already like this i wonder if the cure worse than the disease considering taking the brac genetic test and stopping tamoxifen if i am negative what do you think thanks sarah my first post been out of chemo since feb 16th boy this brings it all back i had dd a c and t the a c stunk but was bearable only the last cycle knocked me all the way down chemo the taxol was easier because i can handle pain better than nausea the neulasta shot always made me ache from the start til the last in fact it go away until the 3rd week after my chemo was over but it did end the pineapple helps as do blueberries try the glutamine powder as a tea i used and heavy also big doses of juice plus i gained 17 pounds during the whole ordeal and got hit with chemical menopause from the first dose of chemo it will end i still have aches and pains some stiffness after sitting still for a while the hair is back but i lose it all until after my chemo ended still nowi look like jamie lee curtis it took about 6 weeks from the last dose to start showing up about the time i lost my last eyelash keep your chin up girls actually been told i look pretty hot not just hot flashes you can do this get through it my 10 year old son and 15 year old daughter have encouraged me all the way through oh and i did lose about half of the weight now pigging out on snickers ice cream bars and sabotaging my diet my reconstruction is ongoing and i hope to finish by the end of this year i did autologus reconstruction and half of it failed so one boob is belly fat and the other is a water balloon it could be worse love all of the plural of thanks kathleen for your info and good luck with the final ac it really is a good thing to have that part done taxol is easier somewhat although every one is different with their i still freaked out about taxol because i knew what ac did sure how i would react to taxol they will keep a close eye on you the first time especially to be sure you have a reaction to the taxol i was told if you would that it would happen in the first 15 minutes i was watching the clock closely they will also monitor your blood pressure closely because taxol can cause it to drop i think that my brain was clearer during taxol but i had more body aches the good thing about taxol is that you are now way done and that really helps alot to know that you are getting close to being done i have a daughter that will be 22 very soon she did talked to her ob gyn last summer was decided that she will not undergo the testing but that she will be watched closer she was told to feel herself up every month was instructed how to do a breast exam and that she should start her mammos earlier i was diagnosed at 49 so she was told to start at 35 been reading the chemo brain stories with interest it sure is nasty stuff it a little better now but i do remember checking to make sure i had the same shoes on walking out the door in the morning then trying to remember if i turned off the coffee pot shut the garage door etc plus i experienced alot of road rage did anyone else have that i was just mad at every car that was in front of me i still kinda drive like a bat out of hell i need to chill with that a bit anyway all of you have an awesome weekend going away for the night with some girlfriends leaving the dh and kids at home looking forward to it just trying to get my life back been on zoladex and arimidex for over 1 yrs it seems to be working i got a recurrence and new primary while first on tamoxifen 44 now i have terrible fatigue and sleepiness plus all those aches stiffness and sore feeling muscles low thyroid to boot after all the treatment been through glad the os and ai are working i vascilate between being sad about lower qol and being thrilled with ned my daughters are 11 and 14 i need more time being mom i have been gaining weight but also not watching my diet or exercising so tired but i hope to improve when school starts again my dexa is in a few weeks be eager to see how it compares to my baseline from 2 years ago read here that there are drugs that reduce the effectiveness of tamoxifen has anyone been told to avoid other drugs while taking armimex particularly xanax my pcp just gave me an rx for xanax to help with anxiety but i want to sabotage my aromatase inhibitor would rather be nervous than recurrent thanks pam i did 72 weeks of herceptin every three weeks diarrehea hair loss nail loss metal taste in my mouth during treatment in the beginning did 8 rounds with taxotere and carboplatin as well it was no picnic but with nuelasta i was able to finish all of it only had to hold a few rounds off for a few days due to blood counts good morning taxol herceptin weekly treatment 2 yesterday and doing well this morning 10 to go some stomach cramps but not bad my face turned bright red like a sun burn but doing better now for those who are going to start taxol soon definitely more tolerable than the conventional chemo losing a little bit of hair jenn 3 so glad you were able to attend your ring ceremony i know what a ring ceremony was you are a trooper 300 people wooooaaaw vickilynn keep on pushing your doctors and nurses for an answer i always get somebody to answer my question my oncologist is very good with crossing my fingers for you good luck on 2 karen 09 i asked my nurse about picc line and there are some that can be flushed once a week jennsdogs kristin i be able to meet with my teacher before school starts on the 9th thinking about dropping a letter at his school explaining my situation have a great weekend manue hi on tamoxifen also i have been fighting weight gain tooth and nail been on it for over 2 years and have gained 15 lbs but i workout and eat healthy most of the time it matter still gaining slowly my doctor said alot of it is water he said hang in there in 3 more years when done lose it well frustrated because my clothes fit anymore i have been a fitness buff for as long as i can remember and now it seem to matter i miss working out and knowing it was making a difference although sure it would be worse if i work out my girlfriend gained alot of weight on tamoxifen and when she went off the weightcame off quick my doctor said i could take water pills but they make me shakey i like that feeling but i did lose alot of water the one time i tried it organic green tea should help with the water also good luck joan thanks for your encouragement as for the taxol diane has suffered very little s e other than extreme fatigue not had any severe bone pain and minimal aches and pains in her joints as others have also stated the taxol does not appear to carry quite the wallop as the a c does the only major downside diane has experienced other than the fatigue has been the carryover of the a c sure making her feel so wiped out best of luck with your tx tom i started out on arimidex and fought joint and bone pain for a year before the dr switched me to aromasin which i promptly developed an allergic reaction to so now been on tamoxifen for over 2 years i still have joint pain but it is mostly kept in check by taking two osteobiflex a day one in the morning and one at bedtime i still have some pain but nothing like before i had someone suggest the soap thing to me and i tried it but got no relief if it works for you great peggy hope taxol goes well for you i have had only one treatment of taxol and to be honest i have felt miserable from it i guess i had become familiar with the s e of ac but the taxol s e are totally different i have weird feelings in my hands like they are twice the size they look my nose is bloody my knees ache my finger nails throb my face hurts i have a bumpy rash all over my legs which is exceedingly itchy i have pins and needles in my left foot and a blood blister on one of my toes perhaps these are all usual side effects but i like them already dreading the next treatment on feb 1st the upside of taxol is that the nausea is not present and that is welcome good crappy morning i was doing what i do every morning putting on my bra with my prostheses i touch the nipples on the prostheses to make sure they are even for just a second i remembered how it felt to touch my own nipples and i broke down into tears my nipples were very sensative and i had to have them stimulated to get in the mood no wonder i want to have sex anymore it has been almost 5 months sorry this may be too much info i just hate this f cking disease it is bad enough to loose my boobs but to have to have surgery to put these numb foobs on my chest i want my nipples back it is not fair i regret having a double mast but i like the ending linda my onc would not let me have immediate recon because she thought i would have to have rads as it was i did not have to have rads but i was glad i waited as the taxotere was hell on my body and i could not imagine having the pain of expanders while i had have the pain from taxotere as it is i am choosing to wait until i loose the chemo weight and get back into shape with my stamina and energy right now it feels like i will never get it back alaska deb you go girl i am going to try that i am sick of saying fine debbie hi everyone thanks so much for writing trying hard to be optimistic we can still get better i know still shifting perhaps all of us off the are 50 and my breasts are feeling suddenly premenstrual sensitive and my thyroid which i know is influenced by hormones justwentoff though after 4 weeks off femara itwas justfine how long does it take ourhormones to readjust itook femara for 5 years and 4months tamoxifen for 2 years how about you also do they know about all the side effects read a lot about muscle joint and bone pain but not about nerve pain but lots of medicine ihave read does cause nerve pain does anyone know when the 10 year study on this drug is coming out more soon with i hope good news lynn carol please count yourself out of receiving avastin there are people who do not receive se that appear evident meaning the symptoms or there lack of can be masked or you just get them i had many symptoms of avastin and received the placebo so it can go both ways i am glad that your able to get through the a c with bearable this couldnot of been any easy challenge darn proud of you your taste buds might still be affected while receiving taxol have to wait and see so hang in there what days will you be getting your taxol shot with taxol the fatigue remained along with finger toe nail discoloration infectionand detachment might suggest removing nail polish so you can keep an eye on your nails neuropathyisa commonse with taxol however the three of us did not get any symptoms getting the drug weekly may be making thedifference definitely easier than a c but not a cake us updated on your progress hi just found this site i finished radiation in december of last year and went on tamoxifen in january 2010 i had terrible side effects the worse being intense abdominal pain i have been on other discussion boards and no one else seems to have this side effect i tried going on again in june and the abdominal pain returned am very confused as to alternatives i am pre menopausal 44 years old and want to take the risk of doing nothing thoughts update well aromasin was worse of all the meds ive taken not only did the joint pain not get better on top of that i had migraine headaches nausea and my hair started to thin out and the hot flashes were unbearable even on effexor went to see my onc after being on the aromasin for 1month can you believe he switched me back to tamoxifen med i was on b4 they removed my ovaries been on tamoxifen for about 2wks now doing much better no more migraines nausea still some joint bone pain of course but according to my docs just take baby aspirin and thats all they can say about the pains which sucks since im in a position right now that i have to start looking for a job b4 unemployment runs out thank you for asking gg i did get my taxol today after all the oncologist was concerned yesterday i developed a full facial swelling and the pain moved to the side of my head and my ear when opening my jaw wide it would hurt inside my hear also the roof of my mouth however last night i started steroids in preparation for my taxol today and this morning all the swelling was gone and i had no pain the oncologist wanted to look at my upper chest and i unbuttoned my blouse only to see a horrible rash on my chest and neck that there earlier today while he looked at my teeth throat ears and facial bones the swelling completely disappered he thought it was the weirdest thing and sent me for of my sinuses he going to give me taxol if it showed any signs of infection although my blood work was fine turned out fine as well all too often sinus infection be seen on an i guess waste of radiation they took 6 pictures i get my antibiotics he thinks it could be some sort of neuralgia or bone pain so he prescribed tylenol with codeine 2 see i am having some pain this afternoon again and took an ibuprofen looks like its helping for now although the swelling creeped back few hours ago and its still there if it persist i guess i will go see my dentist but he will want to take tons of xrays as well and the oncologist said all teeth and gums look fine i guess he have vision so that mean much lociti are you doing weekly or dose dense taxol doing dose dense and i completely know where coming from days are horrendous for me everything hurts even my fingertips bone pain and muscle aches and the flu all rolled into one if doing weekly i thought those side effects as bad for most so if you are doing weekly maybe it last as long hugs hi all forever what wonderful news i know you must be so super relieved jojo awesome about the shrinkage so glad the taxol is doing its job so will your surgery still be after treatment i like the idea that i will have someone doing surgery around the same time as me i think mine will be in january marian i love leonard cohen suzanne was one of my favorite songs when i was young i hope you have a wonderful time at the concert i agree with timbek 2 i miss my normal life of doing fun things and not feeling like such a hermit cancer is so isolating either i feel well or my energy is limited or i am worried about my blood counts i think it is great that you are getting to do something fun damiana aic i hope you are feeling better damiana and i hope neither of you get the bug i heard a woman talking at my last infusion about how she has her little kids take a bath as soon as they are home from school each day sounds like maybe something i should try i wash my kids hands constantly but really what can we do as for taxotere every taxotere treatment seems to be getting worse for me the nausea lasts longer and the exhaustion gets worse it makes me more anxious each time i am definitely feeling like it is cumulative which completely sucks neta 69 the decisions about surgery are so hard my doctor wants me to do a single mastectomy but i am pretty much planning on a double after chemo the body image stuff is definitely hard but i am hoping for good results with my reconstruction the loss of feeling bums me out the most okay i have the worse head ache in the world tonight my house is a mess and i even thought about dinner i have zero motivation to do anything if it was just me i would go to bed but gotta get up and figure it out i did see a great documentary on hbo yesterday called the education of dee dee ricks she is a wealthy socialite who finds out she has breast cancer and then begins fighting to help women without insurance my husband understand why i would watch a movie about breast cancer but sometimes it just feels good to see my experience outside of me does that make sense have a nice night everyone i am so sorry you are goingthrough this i agree with what everyone else has posted when you hear those words you have breast cancer it is overwhelming but please believe me better days are ahead of you you have so many questions and there are so many unknowns at this point your mind just runs wild it is especially hard when you have children i cried for days every time i looked atmy 6 yr old i would think i am not going to be here for him or my other son who is 15 yrs old these were all normalthoughts today do i think i will be here for them heck yes some days it until late in the day when ieven think about the cancer i believehowfar i have come things do get easier just to give you a little background on my situation i was diagnosed in april 2009 i had gone to one doctor who told me i was stage 1 and only needed a lumpectomy he in so many words told mei need to have an mri or anyadditional tests he also told mepeople do die in stage 1 i left his office knowing i was not comfortablewith him and would not be working with him his practice is to also tell his patients the results over the phone because he believe in bringing them to the office because if it is bad news they going to hear anything anyway so that is how i found out i had breast cancer over the phone put it this way it took a few months for me to pay his doctor bill guess i believe inmailing thingsas things can get lost i stopped inone day when i wasin that part of town and paid my bill when i went back to work i was fortunate to get the name of a wonderful female breast cancer specialist in my area from a coworker and proceededonmy journey of fighting breast cancer with her i ended up gettingthat mri thank heavens and with that test i found out that not only did i have the lump i couldfeel but also anotherlump in my right breast and 2 lumps in my left breast i proceeded to haveanultrasound and was told that the only way to determine if thelumps in the left breast were cancer were to do more biopsies i decided right then to just take both breasts a move i do not regret i told the doctorwho read theultrasoundthat he could tell me till he was blue in the face i had nothing to worry about but knowing my personality i would worry a few days after my surgery when i was home my doctor called me and the first words shesaid were you did the right thing the 2 lumps in the left side were dcis while doingthe double mastectomy she took out 4 sentinel nodes and one came back positive on the right sideso i proceeded with the axillary dissection where she took out 33 more lymph nodes and only 1 more was positive even having 2 lymph nodes positive ifeel blessed the lymph nodes did their job i will have gonethrough 16 rounds of chemo before i will have radiation i had 4 rounds of ac and just had my 8th treatmentout of 12 weekly taxol treatments today believe me this is very doable i have been very very lucky with chemo i have been able to work full time i had a little nausea almost like morning sickness really while only receiving the ac the worst thing i have experiencedwith taxol is a littlemuscle bonepain and a little fatigue it sounds absolutelycrazy but this is the best i have felt in years my supervisorat work even told me i look better goingthrough treatment then some peopleat work look who sick or goingthrough any type of treatment i guess that say much for my i mean to drag on about my situation but hopefully it will show you that its hard at first but everyday it gets a little better and once you have your plan in place you will feel so much better and that you are in control one other thing trust your instincts this is what i have done throughout my entire treatmentand i have any regrets at all remember you have cancer cancer does not have you and notice the first 3 letters in the word cancer are can you can beat this good luck in your journey hugs karen if it helps my onc nurses are very much in favor of gabapentin over lyrica they swear by gabapentin and say that lyrica has led to some depression in their experience i took 400 mg nightly while i was on a year of weekly taxol and never developed neuropathy for my initial chemo when i was stage 2 i had developed neuropathy while on dose dense so i looking forward to it stephanie caroline is right fatigue is a definite se of tamoxifen i find that some daily exercise even simply fast walking helps alot if curoius the complete list of se that breast provides effects of selective estrogen activation effects can cause some serious side effects including blood clots stroke and endometrial cancer if you and your doctor are considering tamoxifen as part of your treatment plan tell your doctor if you smoke or have a history of blood clots or heart attack if taking tamoxifen call your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms the most common side effects of tamoxifen are an odd question for the rest of you has anyone noticed that their night sweats are triggered by specific foods been keeping notes and twice in row now more than a month apart had bad nightsweats after eating at one of my favorite middle eastern reataurants sounds wierd huh thinking eating alot of bread which i usually indulge in is anyone else charting food and strong atypical ses been having hot flashes for 10 years i went into immed menapause as soon as i started tamoxifen i was on tamoxifen for 5 years then many mos of femara then many months of aromasin been off everything since oct 2007 the hot flashes seemed to slow down for a while but have been back in force for quite a while hot then cold everyone laughs at me at work i tried effexor but it caused me to have blurred vision i tried neurontin and it gave me an immediate headache i decided the hot flashes were more tolerable than the side effects of these drugs i must say really tired of this i tried vitamin e for a few years and i say it helped i mentioned it several times to my gyn and she said some woman never fully stop having hot flashes i guess one of them i will continue to ask because new treatments come up i hope this discourage you good luck hugs cathy mine thinned on chemo but fall out completely they started to fall out again about 5 weeks pfc because the new hairs were pushing them out they came back quite nice for a while then anastrozole thinned them out annette i am writing because i remember the ovary freakout while on tamoxifen i had hormone level blood tests recommend i asked for this turns out my ovaries were in overdrive and my estradiol levels were through the roof higher than a woman on fertility drugs i remember the panic we are conditioned after our bc dx to go straight to cancer what else could it be turns out lots of things that cancer tamoxifen sometimes tricks the body into thinking that running low on estrogen so it kicks up production not what one needs post bc so i suppressed them medically for six months lupron as i was sick of surgery but hated that more than surgery and was 50 by then so had an ooph want to also say though that even tho done laporoscopically and clearly was the easiest surgery one still needs to take it easy for about a week i had had a hysterectomy a few years earlier unrelated to and per bc but they left in the ovaries at the time i do have issues now w incontinence but i had issues before no easy answers but writing this mostly annette to help you relax be thinking about you just wanted you to know that there are lots of not terrible reasons for ovaries to act up when i was diagnosed i was told to stop my hrt i cut my estrogen patches down little by little and i must admit i had no problems but about a month after the end of the last tiny piece of hormone patch i started to have hot flashes it surprised me that it took so long i also started having pain in my right hip had every kind of test for that and apparently just bursitis then my shoulder started hurting better now but not 100 then last week i just completely blew out my knee on a stationary bike i went to see my gp about all these complaints and asked him whether he thought going estrogen was part of it oh definitely he said i have no idea how manage tamoxifen if it were to make it worse having difficulty walking and have to use a weird technique to get down stairs supposed to keep your weight down but i exercise i have mild osteoporosis so particularly supposed to exercise almost to the point of seeing if i can find a doc who will put me back on estrogen and damn the possibility of a recurrence the point of surviving bc if you use your arms and legs i apologize if be offending anyone and please excuse my ignorance been reading posts from everyone on all topics newly diagnosed and finished my chemo and just started on tamoxifen and i find myself everyday having anxiety attacks and full blown panic attacks because of the what ifs and when will this cancer come back then i read here and i read the diagnosis of people and get so confused why are some women with less than what i have already with mets and stage iv how does that happen very confused about how mets occur when they occur and how can you be diagnosed with 1cm idc no nodes but stage iii or iv and with mets so scared and i just keep focusing on that thank you for your time thanks linda and kathleen for responding i guess just a matter of how much they are raised as to whether they cancel the chemo or not anyway they were back down yesterday and i had my second taxol but they are talking about putting me back to three weekly for the last two as i do seem to have a bad reaction to it so much bone pain that i walk for a day or two and migraine and face pain hands that feel as if they have been burnt this normally kicks in on sunday so not too bad today but noticing a new symptom my skin everywhere is feeling very prickly and getting very sore especially my face and ears i can feel it getting worse by the minute and only am here in ireland i have to ring in next week to let them know how the symptoms were and then they will decide at least no nausea i was so sick with the ac and rather anything than that like you linda my diary has been completely scheduled around my chemo and i was supposed to be delivering a 3 day training course this weekend fortunately they were able to find someone else to do it but i was devastated last week when they told me my chemo would be this week in fact i started off by saying that i do it this friday and then realised that was really stupid and that my chemo treatment is more important than a training course as i only have 2 more to go it really feels like getting towards the end and if they do put me down to 3 weekly i will just have to work around it and enjoy feeling better on the third week which i did apart from tinnitus i hope things go well for you and that you are able to keep to your schedule at least it feels good to know that someone is looking out for the welfare of your liver i cannot imagine how it must be getting taxol every week kathleen you must be very brave best of luck to both of you as i mentioned on another post somewhere i was having chemo the other week and one of the other people there had just had his last one i carry an image of him walking out of there for the last time and think that will be me one day and it will be you too asia zzlady on weekly taxol first then ac i was great until about week 4 then i started having one bad day a week i got taxol on monday and thursdays are bad my symptoms are very low tiny bit of neuropothy in feet only mouth feels like i burned it but no sores any hair has fallen out i shaved the rest there is a weekly taxol group on here suggest you join been good for me to read i failed my blood work before week nine last week but was able to get it today neutrophils were almost zero back to the middle hoping to get through the final three weeks with no more delays going into ac i started tamox in think i was having any the hot flashes for me started with chemo that sent me straight to menopause after my second treatment i think having some joint pain because i had been gaining quite a bit of strength getting back to yoga consistently but in the past few weeks i actually feel weaker in some positions and have a hard time holding myself up is that what the body pain some of you complain about feels like the only other se noticing and not totally sure from tamox is random dizziness i lasts for about 5 minutes and seem to be brought on by anything consistent at first i disregarded it as a se because chemo left me with a heart condition and i thought that was the problem but they appear to match up hello i am so thankful to have found this board i just finished my 4 a c treatments and will begin my 4 taxol treatments on i want to know about possible ses i already have neuropathy in my fingers and toes from a c i am taking gabapentin for this my onc has given me the okay for acetyl l carnitine and glutamine during the taxol treatments can someone share the amounts they take each day thank you so much for sharing whew had a very challenging two weeks recovering from my horrible reaction to and withdrawing from tamoxifen i had heard that i might experience the mood swings emotional lability insomnia andincreased hot flashes that i had experienced in starting tamoxifen but i was surprised when i had severe migraine headaches for four days in a row i had experienced migraines when i started tamoxifen and i guess i just expect that would happen with cessation but it did i certainly hope i get more of them i will give my body a few weeks rest before i start fareston hoping i have really intense side effects with that one hi marta my treatment is also dd axol i have finished ac and am way through my 4 taxol as already stated everyone responds differently to tx for me the ac resulted in terrible fatigue by day 6 after tx i felt mostly normal the first few tx i had the burps mostly just irritating and not enough to really gripe about loss of taste buds was an issue as well again mostly just irritating with the taxol got my tastebuds back i have lost a little over 10 lbs since i started chemo i had already been doing weight watchers since october and i continued to follow that through my chemo i know some gain some lose and some stay the same some ofthe gainsmay be in response to meds like the steroids some could be the cravings for not so healthy foods since the tastebuds are so screwed up i was too stubborn to give in since i worked so hard to lose my weight the chances of not losing your hair are pretty slim i know we all like to hope be one of the very few that and it may very well be the one thing in this whole process that is the hardest to deal with it just plain sucks i did buy a wig through the american cancer society i really just like it and have never worn it and never will so istick with my skull caps and my hats there are some really great skull caps at i started losing my hair about 3 or 4 days after ac 2 buzzed my head at the point when it was just getting too thin and looking totally unhealthy i probably still haveabout 10 left of my buzzed hair achia pet in early stages you should be able to attend your friends wedding just make sure you take care of yourself stay away from people with colds etc been to the zoo a casino and tonight with my oncsokay to a public poolwith myfamily by september you should have a good idea of how you are feeling and how you areresponding to certain things yay on getting the drain removed i surely hated that thing since been reading the boards for a while you may have already seen this but just in case you check out the tips for gettingthroughchemo threadspinned to the top of the message board it is an awesome list of tips and must haves adrienne hi nanasusie yes i did have taxotere t c finished last tx on aug 1st and this has been going the aky legs for about 1 week and the swelling just started thanks again for the info hope things are good with you pam well here i am at the beginning of the second leg of a journey i never intended embarking upon i elected a bilateral mastectomy because i could not envision myself with one large breast and nothing to counter balance it also the breast surgeon and plastic surgeon started to back pedal on the reduction of the large breast at the time of the mastectomy the prosthesis would have to be huge and heavy i lost more than 5 pounds of breast more than 3 weeks out i am strong but still sore and beginning tch 6 cycles of 3 weeks each and then continue the herceptin for a year on sept 10th i had a port installed last friday and it was a very disconcerting recovery the radiology group only prescribed tylenol for pain the pain was so great that i downed 3 than at any time after the mastectomies also the twilight sleep drugged feeling lasted for 3 days after the mastectomy 2 hours i could have walked from the recovery room to my 1 night stay i was alert and never felt the least bit foggy i was doing leg exercises in the recovery and chatting with my who came to cheer me on pretty amazing i am hoping that i do well with the chemo i am planning as much activity as i can tolerate that will include swimming if i can get all these incisions healed up juanelle so glad to see you back by the way love the new pic of you and the grandson the new hairstyle is very becoming although i chat occassionally with you on another site we have missed you over here very much glad you and your dh had such a wonderful time in the grand canyon i know if l could tolerate being alone with my dh that long i might hurt him hahaha just kidding pam i really realize that the arimidex was causing you to have such terrible problems are you still taking it even though you are having tremors i know that i did some research on all of the ai inhibitors vs tamoxifen and their benefits of both vs the riskprior to discussing what i should take with my onco i am post menopausal and have been for 8 years but i decided willing to risk all the side effects of the other medications check out sahalie they have cute buffs been bald since july heat and now winter in the desert the buffs are pretty and work good in the winter i never wear a wig usually a baseball cap or buff i miss my eyebrows and eyelashes the most taxol leaves me with gray spindly hair lol i figure i will be bald the rest of my life so i tell people get used to it i started in nov 2011 with taxol 3 weeks on week off hair completely fall out but end of april 2012 i noticed that my hair seemed to be breaking off rather than falling out went to hairdresser she told me it was new hair so she trimmed my do up pretty short and i have to use mousse but that was almost a year ago i ever worn scarf hat or wig just a headband my scans in feb 2013 were ned had clean scans all through 2012 also i was pretty worried this last round because my right side had been hurting and when i coughed sneezed i had to brace myself because of the pain but scans clear no pleural effusion no liver lesions no active bone mets pulmonologist said that the pain when i cough sneeze could be nerve damage from when they had the pleurx catheter in what i miss most about hair falling out i have to shave my legs it was so nice not to even have to think of that during those early months on taxol becky wave hi i have just got home from onc and bone strengthener treatment and filling anyone thats interested my results i finished abraxane chemo and was given afinitor combined with aromasin tablets to take until i have progression i have been taking the combo for 2 months and have got over the mouth ulcers thank goodness but have skin that without warning will start itching and scratch my back in bed sometimes till it bleeds where i had the palliative rads to spine i have been feeling pretty good overall and believe if i put any anxiety out of my mind not really there lol i saw my oncs offsider and preferred him to the last young girl i saw i went through the usual of him not telling me straight up what my results are but more interested in how i feel as my tumor markers have been rising steadily and in the last 2 weeks gone from 74 to 142 which indicates something is going on i always prefer to have the glass half full so asked him if possible a flare from the new medication and he agreed it certainly is possible the wonderful news is there is no further bone lesions and are stable and the cancerous nodes around heart and lungs have gone yay there is a area in my lower left lung that has no fluid but a white feathery area has appeared that usually would signify i have an infection but i feel fine he said this could on further questioning could be cancer also there is a tiny 7mm spot on my liver which could be an unidentified node always been there and missed or cancer of course i asked if i would continue on the a a combo or have to do chemo no way i want that this soon and he said he would discuss with the boss he came back and said good news your onc thinks the lung issue could be just the result of the medication you are on so will continue with the tablets and have a lung x ray in 4 weeks to see going on i know the afinitor can give you serious lung issues but at this stage i have no effects from whatever is going on i had 2 blood pressure tests last week was high and these 2 were an hour apart and the first was normal and the second was high go figure so i read my report and they say that suspected areas in lung and liver could be metastasis but in my heart i think they are but of course that could be wishful thinking he said tumor markers can be unreliable as many that rise are nothing and others that are good have progression which i knew anyway will continue on my merry way love to you all gail grouphug i blame femara i had it in both thumbs the left was particularly bad and eventually a surgeon cut the sheath holding the tendon to ease the pain once i stopped taking femara the right thumb resolved on own to answer the original post no diabetes but did have thyroid issue cancer left lobe of thyroid was removed however that was ten years prior to the trigger finger so i doubt that was a factor but who knows jab you sound great and perky glad you are doing so well now so soon after surgery woooohooo you will get a vacation before you know it and bc will not be your life quirky hoping the pains go away soon are you on tamoxifen could it be that i have aches and on tamoxifen lisa the tshirt sounds great to me too you are a hoot wally praying for you to get through this and feel better i know it sucks phebe bec and amazon praying for you both as well how on earth do you do a virtual anything i wonder if us computer challenged people will be able to swing that not sure if i will help i went to the tangerine spa today aveda hair place i bought gel to help me little twigs of hair stand up more to look fuller am i insane but it is growing at weird angles like a faux hawk and i want it to not go that way anyhow also bought some nice smelling oil as my scalp seems dry lately i love the way their things smell sure everyone thought it funny to see me in there with hardly any hair but it honestly makes me feel better to be doing something with it weird also saw the vascular dr he said i need an ultrasound of vein he thinks the port injured my vein or i have a blood clot he said i am pretty much ok of not having it give me an aneurism since been this long whaaatttt i about died he then said every day longer causes less risk of clot going to my brain but probably not a clot i think he knew how my panicked brain works after this bc that was so not the speculative kind of things to say to me so supposed to get ultrasound next week nice that stupid port has caused me so much trouble i knew i want one so i have that and my scans on monday hard week it will be but after that then i might really be able to move on praying hoping happy weekend to you all my sisters in this last yr for 6 mo i did 2000mg per day of xeloda and had the awful hand foot did bag balm b6 and added celebrex in the last 2 cycles nothing helped much this yr i am on 1500 mg per day doing b6 celebrex from the beginning and also the urea cream see below article from annie appleseed doing 40 vs the suggested what a huge difference this time around almost no hand foot symptoms at all if i can just get over the fatigue from radiation i will be back on track will know more in a couple of weeks about the effectiveness of this low dose xeloda onc says it will be just as good as higher dose xeloda worked for me last time great it was the aromasin afterwards that failed next try after xeloda is falsodex wondering if tamoxifan would be better never done that one i already had a long run on femara novel effective management of capecitabine induced hand foot syndrome d pendharkar h goyal batra cancer center n delhi india abstract background hand foot syndrome palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia is common side effect of capecitabine grade toxicity is seen in of the patients and may lead to discomfort with activities of daily living interruption in the treatment and dose reductions are very frequent due to this toxicity aim of the study was to analyze efficacy of local application of keratolytic agent urea cotoryl r on capecitabine induced toxicity methods patients on capecitabine were followed for signs of hand foot syndrome thirteen such episodes were recorded out of theses 4 episodes were of grade iii and 9 of grade ii toxicity all had dry furrowed skin rash desquamation on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet patients with grade iii toxicity had additionally painful erythema discomfort with activities of daily living all patients were asked to apply locally twice a day urea containing moisturizing ointment the same preparation was used prophylactically in 7 cycles of capecitabine results this application had a dramatic impact on dermatological complications within days of initiation the effect lasted till continuation of the application it lead to reduction in desquamation pain and comfort level of all the patients improved neurological symptoms improved as well all patients were able to complete the chemotherapy cycle as per the schedule and without interruption or delays efficacy was seen in patients where it was used prophylactically did not develop cutaneous manifestation and two had grade i toxicity conclusions urea containing preparation appears to be an excellent choice for the prevention and treatment of capecitabine induced hand foot syndrome this minimizes drug delays schedule interruptions and maintains the dose density owing to reduced morbidity the drug tolerance and acceptance is considerably improved abstract no 8105 remember we are not doctors and have no medical training anyone know the timeframe for starting tamoxifen as an adjuvant therapy following chemo and radiation i started it a few months back and seem to have an allergy to it after 13 doses rash and hives just tried it again and had rash and hives within hours i am going to wait again and try it a third time log in to post a reply my hematocrit and hemoglobin are dropping below normal range and my onc is talking aranesp but i looked up the side effects and it looks scary and not worth it so here are my questions for you 1 did take aranesp or procrit and did you have side effects 2 did you have b12 folic acid or ferritin levels measured as well 3 did you pursue other options and if so what were they and did they work 4 i only have one more taxol treatment

lately hope things are going well for you sorry if i missed anyone but my time is up now another busy week ahead hope everyone has a peaceful sunday my thoughts are with you all hugs fumi tammy the onc nurse told me that there is a range on the dosages of chemo they give and depending on some of the the that you are having the onc may adjust the dosage within those ranges they are watching the numbness and tingling in my toes from the taxol and this is one of the things she said he might adjust the dosage for from what i have heard like fatigue are cumulative each week you have less reserves to draw upon other might not be the same hope this was some help sending hugs and wishes for a se free week to everyone annette i stopped femara 9 months early when i asked for a thyroid test for at least the tenth time and the oncologist explained it was male pattern baldness and not my thyroid not everyone gets the level of shedding that i experienced but i find anyone who would tell me it was temporary i had an oncotype score of 9 and chose to take a risk that i know is a risk when i stopped femara i had some regrowth but not a lot all of the hormone inhibitors including tamoxifen can but may not cause thinning and what they call male pattern baldness i was furious he was philosophical same with lymphedema and so many other things not life threatening so not real enough to point to so wrong warmly cathy laurie your onc sounds a bit of a nightmare with no bedside manner by the sound of it i had an mx suggested to me at one stage when i just had bone mets and then they suddenly decided it a good idea after all too really think these people should think before they speak a lot more of the time val lovely that your daughter is coming over and that you will be feeling good having had your blood by the time she arrives have a wonderful time lovely to have something to look forward to i feel sick on the steroids been nauseous at all on either chemo but i do feel absolutely exhausted this afternoon have had a couple of hours sleep and just got up again but can hardly drag myself around my daughters will be in charge of cooking this evening methinks also feel as though broken both ankles and several fingers they did mention joint pain after tax but expecting it to be quite so centralised in just certain areas thought ache all over but not the case not asking any more about my tms until had another scan which will hopefully show that tax is working and then the markers should be dropping love lesley xx hi sonia yeah i am also taking the letrozole everyday and have the injection every three months of zoladex hope you get any side effects on the arimidex some chance i am having loads of hot flushes my yoga teacher calls them power surges and times also when i feel really cold at least my hair is growing back since finishing chemo take care snoogle x stuck maybeinput from others will help me to get off the fence my internist is concerned my bc may be active again history idc 2003 stage 2 locally invasive node positive nodes lumpectomy was followed by a year of active treatment chemo adriamycin cytoxan and taxotere and radiation followed by one year of tamoxifen until officially menopausal and then followed by 7 years of arimidex which was eventually discontinued because of osteoporosis treatment kicked my butt physically emotionally and financially the tremendous amounts of dexamethasone left me with an 80 lb weight gain since lost side effects almost too numerous to mention depression gerd thrush hot flashes neuropathy insomnia sexual dysfunction menopausal dryness inability to maintain potassium too much sweating with the hot flashes osteoporosis lymphedema and borderline poverty from all the expense hot flash miseryeventually progressed to the point that i went against recommendations and started hormone replacement therapy some of the side effects diminished hot flashes went away and for the first time in 11 years i could have sex again and possibly save my 38 year marriage but my own personal fear level went on high alert because i was doing something contraindicated current issue i have for the last month felt a pain in the ribs under the bc breast during 2003surgery for tumor removal some rib had to be taken to facilitate tumor removal internist wants a breast mri i know we are both very concerned with what is going on federally mandated healthinsurance in my experience stinks facility wants several thousands of dollars in insurance deductible plus my 30 no payments are offered i find myself stuck over what to do if i go ahead with the testing and am fortunate enough to get good results i have essentially taken every bit of disposable income we have for the next year and thrown it away if i go ahead with the testing and the results are not good not 100 sure go through treatment a second time anyway i know what to do been struggling with this since may 18th and still cannot decide what to do appreciate any input i lost 30 lbs during chemo 4 ac and the following year of herceptin both the chemo and herceptin suppressed my appetite a side effect for some patients and asi had to make myself eat i chose nutritious but not high calorie food for my diet i figured that besides knocking out the cancer cells i might as well gain the benefit of weight loss also sparky radiation treatments made me very depressed but after about a month i seemed to snap back with exercise and and traveling give yourself some time not everyone breezes through rads i am on my 5 th year of tamoxifen still have joint pain but have learned to live with it hot flashes have really decreased this last two years without meds heading to the gym or a good long walk every second day really helped keep my joints moving great going jon hey not vanity so much nobody wants to be turned fat by a drug along with joint pain a massive edema how do you tell the diff between fat water weight they look and weigh the same but soo sick of my ankles swelling out in these huge tight knobs either side of my leg and my waists of my clothes not fitting on humid days that hmmmmmm thinking of switching to armidex when i see him end of august i have to take lasix every so often through the sticky weather now not good my onc is giving me an echocardiogram and accepting my muga finally and what if the tests are ok my onc says he feels my heart isnt he feels in a low voice the femara if the tests are ok switching thanks for sharing not vain beautiful you go sister hi all a 44 year old who was dx and treated two years ago for stage iii bc just got married for the first time last year to a 29 year old moved to istanbul and started a new career i started tamoxifen the week of our wedding and have done great on it i actually lost 10 pounds right after starting tamoxifen putting me at my ideal weight i kept the weight off for over a year thinking of trying to have a kid so my had me stop the tamoxifen for a few months so we can do some tests it has been seven weeks so far and during the seven weeks i have gained nearly fourteen pounds i walk miles a day and have not changed my eating habits in any way have any of you experienced this after going off tamoxifen thanks for any advice sharon in istanbul so am i jlw i have always been quite tiny 54kg to 56 kg rarely fluctuate but my diet has been mostly carbs and sugar for many years till recently im going on the 2 day break diet too since starting tamoxifen diagnosis i have piled on fat around the middle looks funny with my skinny legs it concerns me so have been trying to work out how to get rid of it without losing weight everywhere as i dont have much to lose elsewhere will let you know the results my diet has changed dramatically but i am making those changes step by step dont want to freak my body out too much lynn that sounds like such a nice outing in boston how glamorous to be whisked away in a limo i was there last september and we stayed at the park plaza my husband was a speaker at a conference he was busy all day almost everyday so i roamed around copley square and went nuts over the fashion scene i loved calypso and the leggings that were the rage then especially after living like a hick out in pinckney where you really see the underside of lake living at the local we ate at durgin park instead of taking a taxi we walked over through boston gardens and took a look at beacon hill once we were in the restarant i looked around saw all the bostonians and remember that once i had been one and never dreamed i would ever get out of boston they seemed like aliens to me now skye all those things are you taking would totally scramble my brain now just remembering when and how to take it and why i am taking it about all i can manage to remember to get my prozac and centrum silver down in the am and the keflex at night on low dose for 3 month to keep away the ut infections my biggest concern about drugs now is that i will have to change ssris in order to take tamoxifen antidepressant drug of choice for tamo a nasty breaking in and getting off period and i am quite happy with prozac wish i have to change but the onc at um agrees with me that arimidex and the other ais can greatly accelerate bone loss which none of us needs maybe i can just stop the altogether sounds better than what you go through with effexor hot flashes seem to be tapering off is it because we got rid of the winter bedcovers have a single one today and remember one yesterday suddenly my eyebrows have some darker hairs like they popped up over night strangely i am quite embarrassed about having so little pubic hair i look like an androgenous space alien is it ok to use nioxin everywhere not sleeping i kind of get still and quiet but my brain stop working rationally i am thinking hard about my life all night long i dream except for a short time when the night is almost over talked to the oncology nurse about this i have been cutting down on ativan from halves to quarters and then nothing and been sleeping i really want to resume or start any more drugs but i want this insomnia to get established either because it can be hard to stop once it starts crying has become ridiculous i cry over something new every other day today i cried because when i called a friend they were busy and talk on the phone very long i think i cried for a full decade before this year mizsissy hi vanessa i have been on abraxane since january and have had minimal side effects i also do three weeks on and one week off i am now getting 8 weeks off to give my body a break from chemo and then will be moving to a new treatment in august as far as my abraxaneside effects go i would sayhair loss some muscle achesin my legs 2 or 3 days after treatment and finger nail issues i have tolerated the abraxane well and i am sure you will too good luck kim i am new to this forum i did mastectomy two months ago i am now surfering from depression and scare of cancer coming back i am taking tamoxifen and sleep pill zolipidem every day i know if the drugs contribute to my mental problem of course the stress on cancer definitely plays a important role but i feel my depression is getting worse since i taking tamoxifen how do you get over these i would like to hear from your experience and treatment thank you log in to post a reply lisa i took the cyp 2d6 test to determine if i was metabolizing tamoxifen efficiently because i was not having any side effects whatsoever the result showed i was an intermediate metabolizer which means i could be getting a reduced benefit from tamoxifen and there is some evidence that reduced metabolism for her 2 patients couldhave significant implications regarding recurrence my onc switched me to femara letrozole which isan ai shown to be effective for her 2 and goserelin zoladex for ovarian suppression i am having an oopherectomy tomorrow so i have to have the goserelin injections and can be sure the ai is doing its job because i will definitely be the uncertainty about tamoxifen and her 2 was causing alot of anxiety for me and because i am 46 and not planning to have more children i feel this is the right decision for me all the best to you i took tamoxifen for 5 years started just before menopause and decided not to switch to an ai after menopause because tamoxifen was so easy for me to tolerate and i wanted to prevent bone loss my mo was ok with my decision i had one endometrial polyp on tamoxifen which had to be dealt with and some very ocassional leg cramps which i think were helped by exercise i am active and like to work out no other side effects at all also i lost some weight on tamoxifen which was nice i agree with the advice to ask for a pelvic ultrasound every 6 months or every year just be be sure thereisnot too muchendometrial thickening or other gyn issues i had my mastectomy a year ago in december and finished my chemo in june i have herceptin until april at least i have mild flu symptoms the first few days chills and things the second week i have an awful time with my joints mainly the knees fingers and elbows my feet have hurt ever since i started the taxotere and that has never gone away i am getting some energy back but by 2 pm i need to have all my work done for the day as i am worn out and just function i know some of this might be caused by the aromasin i take but the flare up of the joint pain can only be the herceptin as it is cyclic to the infusion i have not had the heart issues elena i would also encourage you to see a cardiologist jenna with you i struggle to keep my fears in check i have an awful time with my short term memory which use to be my strongest point well thanks for all the input on here it really does help that i am not alone hi ladies just trying to catch up on all the great posts had a big setback but fortunately only temporary i contacted an infection in the left breast and armpit area with fluid and even though on it seem to be going away the surgeon said it probably get better for about 4 weeks yuck anyway nothing i handle or stand right now my 16th birthday was this past wednesday and the hubby and i took all the kids and and a couple of their friends to disneyland we left on tuesday and came home yesterday it was a lonnnnggggg 2 days but i love seeing the grandkids and watching them running around having fun been suffering terribly with my allergies lately and my eyes seem to constantly be running along with my nose taken everything over the counter and every time the dr prescribes something it seems like i have to wait forever for an approval for it if it comes through at all been waiting 9 days at present and more miserable with the allergies than the infection right now bother suggesting anything for it though since i have just about anything ever made over the counter and nothing works lol great to hear that some of you are finally finished up with your chemo i applaud you all my last tac will be this next wednesday and i will be done for good no rads but will have to do armidex after that but not sure how soon terrified of the bone and joint pain that goes along with the hormone inhibitors and pray that i can stay on it with no problems i hear of so many women who have to discontinue it those of you talking about your hair regrowth the biotin that is supposed to help make the hair come back thicker i hear it works well with the hormone inhibitors as well since those seem to make the hair thin again i have mine here and ready to go as soon as the onc says all clear got mine in the vitamin section at jacques glad to hear staying with us mets is no fun sure and quite hard to deal with mentally sure but know that loved by us all and be there for you and pray for your well being curious as to been going on with the wedding plans love angel happy for you hey all tamoxifen is giving me wicked night sweats at times have to strip off my and sleep w o it for the rest of the night otherwise really not that bad the drug rads are tedious and sometimes technicians as nice as the chemo nurses they just seem to be in a hurry like an feel oh well just a few more weeks my hair is nearly 2 inches long and i think keep it short i believe it but so many people have used the word stunning about my new hairdo with dark and wavy for the first time in my life i guess the silver lining in the cancer cloud but my eyelashes and eyebrows are still thin and not growing very fast darn it hugs to all of you just jumping in a bit late on this trail but wanted to touch on the se of tamoxifen from my personal experience first off i was diagnosed in 2004 with adh in my right breast have a very strong family history of bc have a lifetime riskfactor of 28 am brca negative have mris and mammograms alternating every six months had a preventative tah bso hysterectomy in 2007 and was on tamoxifen for three years prior to my hysterectomy it was only after my body stopped producing the boatloads of estrogen i was so richly blessed with that i was able to come off tamox for me the initial se were leg cramps at bedtime night sweats and hot flashes after approximately months the leg cramps subsided followed by the night sweats the hot flashes continued throughout the three years but gradually decreased to the point i barely noticed them unless i was in a stressful situation i did not gain weight while on tamoxifen as a matter of fact i lost weight since 2004 i have had numerous biopsies and a total of three surgeries both my breasts are scarred but still intact unfortunately after my mri a day ago i got the dreaded phone call frommy bs that there is something suspicious going on so i am now scheduled for a mammogram followed by an ultrasound and biopsy this coming monday morning they are moving fast which i am grateful for although i have been through this a number of times i still hold my breathe anyway taking tamoxifen is a personal decision for patients imho as leaf indicates you can stop taking them if you like them please remember that the key to everything is being extremely diligent by doing being aware of your body and listening to it not missing appointments and and being routinely tested on a regular basis while the adh was detected through a stereotactic core biopsy my lumps were detected by every single time including one that i did just one month after a routine mammo that never picked anything up proactive is the word kyroheal i think the only one on the thread right now who is getting taxol because getting my treatments in reverse i still have a c to look forward to my ses have been very minimal the fatigue is the one se that seems to be the most cumulative for me days 3 4 5 being the most difficult i just had my 3rd round of taxol this past thursday saturday i took two naps yesterday i took one now today 4th of july wide awake at am i am taking ambien for sleep at night this cycle it is helping tremendously are you getting the neulasta shot with your taxol i highly recommend taking claritin for the bone pain my first shot i did not take it suffered dearly these past two times it was much much better in fact had no bone pain at all say i do feel some muscle fatigue which is caused not only by the neulasta but also the taxol if i sit too long or walk too long doing the opposite seems to alleviate the problem so my advice would be continue to hydrate water is best get something for sleep if steroids keep you from resting take the claritin as it not only helps with the neulasta but also the taxol side effects also try to exercise daily even a short walk is helpful i cannot comment on whether or not you will still be experiencing ac effects in september i would imagine if nothing else you would expect to be tired sure some of the other ladies on here can answer that more clearly perhaps post your question on the april or may board to see how those ladies faired once their treatments were done if i were in your shoes go forward with the wedding provided you have a lot of help support to pull the day off the way you are dreaming it will be especially if not planning an immediate honeymoon can take the next day or two to recuperate although i think i remember that you are knee deep in your studies would you need to jump right back into that best of luck congratulations on your engagement i strongly suggest trying turmeric and ginger for your joint pain been on it for about a year and helped me to get rid of about 90 of my pain and i just saw a story on the today show about how much it helps with arthritis my holistic doc put me on them and said he puts all his arthritis patients on them completely changed how well i am dealing with tamoxifen after my hysterectomy in jan my pain ramped up so i just upped my dose and went right back to feeling great i started adriamycin 30 every 2 weeks is my dosage not looking forward to any of this the booster shot is what sent the ball rolling i dont like the nausea even though there is meds i dont want to cling to anymore toxins than i need to advice anyone i am the caregiver of not 1 but 2 elderly parents one of which is terminally with colon cancer that has spread to the liver in hospice at home while my dad has dementia and also prostrate cancer too far along to have surgery they both are in their late 80 s and just celebrated their 50th anniversary not sure if i made the right choice taking this treatment hoping for the best so far lost taste buds i feel bloated with indigestion a great cook with no taste buds so i even feel for the food i cook for my family anymore the headaches are horrendous any advice i just want to get off of this emotional roller coaster because i really pay for the ride pray for me i started out worrying about my hair which is past my knees but that became a lower priority when i realized that worst things were pending i am a defiant one so there will be no wigs for me i just want to get thru this move on to radiation and be done as going thru this treatment neglected to tell my parents that i too am ill as i watch them deteriorate it help them in in anyway to know about me i do want to cry sometimes but the tears seem to be afraid to face me or maybe the other way around hello all trying to catch up after a few days away first of all yay rebecca so glad all is well and you seem to be adjusting to the new softttt girls it really is amazing i did well with percocet just make sure you take a stool softener dawn lynn i hold you in the highest of places to be so selfless to go ahead with adoption one of my good friends has been a foster mother for several years and has adopted a couple of the children it is such a process as a teacher i see how many needy children there truely are and many times wanted to take them home myself i get very saddened and distressed at times seeing hearing of how some innocent children are treated it would be a gift for any child to end up with either one of you brenda thanks for sharing such personal feelings i have also thought of death dying the scariest part for me would be leaving my children with my husband who would not have a clue what to do with them when my girls were little i was having pain under my arms when i bathed them and had myself convinced i had breast cancer back then i started a journal for them in case i around when they grew up i have definitely learned that any day in any of our lives can be the last so we have to live it the best we can i get frustrated with myself sometimes because i fell like i have fallen right back into my life i had before bc and really wanted to be a little different i find it hard to take time for myself and take care of myself when i put all of my energy into my kids family raeinnz like to hear more about the femara i am currently on tamoxifen and my oncologist wants to change me to an ai in june i had a total hysterectomy in nov not sure why he kept me on the tamoxifen but he said it was either 5 years of tamox and then 5 years of ai or just 5 years of ai i am very leary of the side effects besides some light hot flashes i seem to have many side effects right now of course the problem of losing weight the fact that i seem to get very emotional easily also looms but i know if that is from hysterectomy going off prozac tamoxifen or just life on a good note my friend at work found out on wednesday that her tumor was not cancer the doctors were shocked there were lots lots of tears of joy it makes you believe in the power of prayer thank you everybody have a great weekend lisa wow fbn so cool i too love stp looks like scott cleaned up his act and is doing well i think i would faint if i met him oh and i wonder if what your mo meant was no side effects for months or years taxol is but it does cause neuropathy which can take some time to resolve years out from final taxol chemo and i still have some pretty annoying neuropathy in the balls of my feet betcha that was what he meant hope all went well today girlstrong grading is subjective on the part of the pathologist special k is also right it depends on what area they are looking at on biopsy i was stage 3 pathology from the lumpectomy put me at stage 2 two different pathologists reading two different parts of my tumor tadover welcome help so feel alone lago way to go letlet in a tough spot right now finishing chemo and feeling pain still from the mastectomy hard to fathom more surgery and healing with what going through right now if you need some time to heal before the reconstruction take it there a rush and if feeling better it might make the decision easier i can totally relate to what going through i had very similar experiences as you i had pain from the taxol should go away fairly soon the neuropathy i guess can take a long time i was fortunate i only had mild tingling in my finger tips the pain from the axillary dissection is real i had that as well lymphatic cording causing pain down my arm and down the right side of my chest it took a few months and i saw a physical therapist but that did go away eventually also the tissue expanders can cause some of that so it might feel better once the expander is out i had reconstruction on the right and a lift on the left as for the lift i say there was no pain but it was minimal compared to the rest of what i went through overall the reconstruction was fairly easy i think you would regret not having the lift i had a little aching after the surgery but it was manageable with just tylenol and it was gone within a week or 2 now that i finished taxol on october 7th i thought i would summarize my own experience with the my wbc did really well all through a c and taxol so that was not an issue and i continued neulasta shots all the way through both drugs my rbc was very low at the end of a c and the nurses were asking my onco if i needed transfusion i focused on eating more spinach salads and bought some steaks and cut them in small portions and froze them individually so that i could throw one on the grill a few times a week for lunch this seemed to help bring the rbc back up enough to not be questionable i know that it is still a bit low but not in a needing treatment range i was at when they considered transfusion i did usually get a little benadryl nap at each treatment but not enough to worry about driving the steroids had me too wired to sleep for very long i felt much better mentally on taxol compared to a c there was much less of a mental fog and nausea i did get a ton of bone pain that started two days after treatment and lasted days each time i could barely walk with this pain and found my hips knees and ankles giving out the only thing that worked for my pain was oxycodone allergic to the last treatment the pain lasted six days when i had this pain i could not work or function well at home i was working at home and would work through it on the last day of the pain but if they needed me to work during those days it was extremely difficult if not impossible mostly i just slept and took oxycodone and barely nibbled on some food during those days now i am struggling with neuropathy in my hands and feet it was not too bad during treatments what i did get of it faded by the time the next treatment came however with the last treatment the neuropathy was much stronger and has still been continuing we will have to see if it goes away i take a b6 supplement every day and have for about a year i know that the effects are different for everyone but i wanted to share my own list of overall i would still take the taxol over the a c even with all the pain because i felt so good and had clear thinking and no digestive issues on the days that i in pain i looked at it as designated rest days in the end what we can see by mri the tumor went from cm to cm i lost cm thank you maud for your response hmm yeah i imagine that if to purchase a us supplement i will have to be very vigilant concerning the soy they put in them such a shame my radsdoc prescribed a whole lot of vitamins of which i took none because every single one vit c vit e etc had either parabens and or soy in them i know now i should have taken the vitamin e supplementation cause today i have breathing issues the vitamin e is to humidify the membranes especially in the lungs and stomach so one get oversensitive silly me i know but hey you learn every day good for you that off the tamoxifen i checked out lornas site and funny enough she recommends floradix for anemia due to heavy periods in the same article as estrosmart guess what been taking for the last two weeks hehe floradix sure did help my periods lasted for 13 days niagara falls style so sorry for the explicitness and i developed anemia had problems with that when i was a teenager i tried the plant based floradix for more iron and after days i felt gooood no tiredness palor irritability depressive thoughts greati also read your link about grapefruit seed extract from the british journal my understanding is that it is supposedly bad for er gals as it heightens estrogen levels i must say quite dubious to that study maybe because a fan of the supplement and want to give it up then again it is only one paper and still premeno the study was for postmenopausal women speaking of which what an interesting study about in foods my kind of news chemo day for me yesterday changed things up a bit with me starting steroids the day before then the slowed down the infusion a bit too like clockwork the diarrhea hit me 30 minutes after i was done so far its not quite as severe as last time lost two pounds since monday when i had my blood work done not sure why since eating and have diarrhea yet anyway my counts are all good with my liver numbers back to normal ranges so lets see if they stay there today go in for my neulasta shot plus a bag of fluids for the weekend then if i need them scheduled for fluids again on monday and weds trying to be proactive now that we know my stomach like the taxotere hopefully preventing colitis so far feeling ok a bit tired from the meds in the iv and chemo brain has set in so having trouble with word retrieval in conversation hubby says its like talking to me when drunk loltwo down two to go my daughter turns 18 today she as well as the other 4 at home has down syndrome and lots of respiratory problems and her asthma has kicked in working hard to keep her out of the er because really not up for sitting at the hospital for hours or overnight i stopped taking tamoxifen also i slogged through two years and two months i started a thread called time for me to fess up where i talk about it fatigue has been my number one complaint since radiation in hindsight i think hypothyroidism is a problem for me but getting that one diagnosed is an exercise in frustration an old normal range of 3 to which became obsolete in 2002 yet two different labs my internist my onc and my gyn are not up to date on this i have an oncologist who even test my fsh levels he says that information helpful i understand that testing on hormone levels tend to fluctuate but good grief to not look at it ever seems like a bit of a leap especially when my hormone receptors tested positive i have a gyn who finally tested my fsh for the first time ever last year was 48 at that time i was pronounced menopausal at that time or was it post menopausal cant remember i would encourage you to continue your quest for feeling good again and get some help for your thyroid i was still feeling crappy six weeks after stopping the tamoxifen and i think it was attributable to my hypothyroid condition sure i posted somewhere about my thyroid learning curve that one really makes my head spin find a giant crevass between alternative medicine and mainstream medicine on the topic of iodine frankly had it up to my eyeballs with the mainstreamers and found some relief by following advice from alternatives well that got rather long winded anyway i feel like tamoxifen really kicked my butt also i also had trouped through chemo surgery rads and managed to stay vertical very distressing for the wind to disappear from your sails and not be able to get it back i had 6 treatments of fec taxotere weekly 18 treatments by the end i felt grey and washed out i thought i was turning into a bald eagle with my fingernail ses wow it feels great to know not just me i feel like waking my hubby up and say look this is what been telling you with me the heat stays only in my head my face get real red hair soaking wet and my face is extremely hot to the touch while the rest of my body feels cool it scares me at times because the heat is so concentrated in one area it is so embarissing i tell folks having a chemo moment a year after finishing chemo told my doctor that not hot flashes but he understand i wake up at night hot so i guess lucky there i am glad i found this site i signed up in 2006 and never came back until tonight and so far i have learned that not the only one that the tamoxifen causes bone pain in or depression and hot spells if i keep looking i might find out a reason for the brain fog and forgetting thanks folks saw my oncologist today and as expected my ct scan showed some progression in my liver mets i surprised since my tumor marker numbers have been rising i have been on taxotere for 10 months and have developed mild neuropathy in an effort to avoid long term problems with the neuropathy my oncologist changed my chemo to cmf the general consensus among the doctor and nurses at the oncology office is that this chemo will cause less fatigue than the taxotere does anyone have any thoughts experiences history with these two regimines thanks connie log in to post a reply hi marietjie what a lovely way to spell your name the same as my dd ah now fatigue it could well be a combination of all of the above or just the tamoxifen do you see a naturopath why i ask is they have something called adaptan which aids your adrenals a lot of the fatigue although caused by treatment is because your adrenal glands are overworked and under stress the adaptan is an adrenal support so does help with your energy levels but is a practitioner medicine only so not available over the counter also when do you take your tamoxifen morning or night sometimes changing the time of day will also help love n hugs chrissy cheryl i have one more taxol to go already had 3 dd and did not lose my eyebrows eyelashes arm hair leg hair etc even though my onc told me i would lose the rest of my body hair on taxol i would think it is not working but i am having stage 2 neuropathy so i guess that is a blessing in disguise have you lost yours yet carol currently doing my 2nd cycle of tchp diarrhea led to me being hospitalized due to dehydration mo reduced my taxotere this round but 2 days after the diarrhea is back i only had 2 days of normal bm before this mo has me on medical grade and probiotics and just told me to take more immodium this really has me worried that i be able to make it through chemo hi melanie sorry suffering with here are a couple of things you might try biotene mouthwash toothpaste for the furry tongue if that work you could ask for a rx for magic mouthwash i tried it myself but read about it ibuprofen for the bone pain some women use claritin i think they are usually using it for pain from the neulasta shot but it might work for pain from taxotere i never knew if my body aches were from the taxotere or the neulasta ibuprofenhelped me but it can irritate the stomach as for nausea i had aloxi by iv just before the t c and it worked for me i believe zofran is similar but sometimes one works better for some people than the other some women swear by emend so if one work maybe try the other the next time i had compazine on hand but i need it my nurse also suggested for constipation and pepcid for any heartburn i think i remember my onc telling me to be carefulin the sun i think these meds make you photosensitive i usually felt backed up and bloated for the first week the ibuprofen took care of my body aches and i was tired wiped days but after that i felt better so i hope your will be gone by tuesday so you can enjoy your trip hope you have a great time in disney good morning everyone i am on day 6 after dd taxol and neulasta shot and still experiencing bone pain plus stomach bloating i thought this taxol would be easier to take than this cafelovr i think you will get the bone pain because it comes from the combination of the taxol and neulasta i think people on weekly dosage get the neulasta so hopefully you will miss out on this se alicia i hope you get good news on your scan today i am curious if the bone pain is about the same each time or gets worse i am not sure i can work if it is much worse as i am only taking the vicodin at night before bed i tried some claritin today so we will see how that goes slv congrats on your last chemo today hope it goes very well best wishes for a se free day shelley hi nm and g copied this from my post to tender and binney just got back from i love this doctor great she says normal post lumpectomy rads changes this was the first cbe performed on me she thinks scar tissue rads changesfrom tx which is still sore and tender no lumps or cancer bumps we talked about u s but think it was necessary right now as she feel any cysts or fluids going to check it again in a july i have an mri scheduled for this nov i told her my new boob doctor if i ever need the med onc rad onc or surgeon well then go back and see them again or better yet she can talk to them and let them know coming frankly sick of those guys thanks for your responses gals the greatest brendaps she was tickled pink up to 10 mg a day on tamoxifen now working on titrating up to 20 mg very slowly to avoid nausea have been on effexor xr for a few months i started at once a day and then after a couple of months i went to 75 g once a day i have felt so much better since i have been on it much calmer not anxious at all and a side effect of this med is that it reduces hot flashes which for me was a great problem once i started tamox i used to get up every night a few times drenched in sweat and had many hot flashes throughout the day the effexor xr basically stopped the night sweats and now i have the occasional daytime flash but hardly any i think the docs prescribe effexor for those of us on tamox because alot of the other depression meds conflict with tamox and also because of the s e of reducing the hot flashes i had no trouble adjusting to the effexor at all but i know some people do as for getting off it i have read that some people have difficulty but if it is a slow controlled tapering off it should be fine i will worry about that when i need to as for the dosage 75 g is pretty common see how you feel it may take a few weeks to actually make a big difference although for me i literally felt better within days i remember thinking to myself i wish i had started taking this months earlier i was so emotionally spent and anxious from my aneurysm experience and then my bc diagnosis oy glad you had a good time r r in the sun and sand is always lovely a 72 year old florida resident diagnosed in the summer with idc had a lumpectomy on with no lymph node involvement finished 12 weeks of taxol on 11 along wih that i was getting herceptin every 3 weeks because i was getting extremely cold and no amount of layering was warming up after finishing taxol i went to a lower dose every week infusion of herceptin has anyone else experienced this extreme coldness the experts think it is from the herceptin i still do i had some harsh side effects from the taxol swollen feet and legs fatigue sleep problems effected toe nails neuropathy tingling in hands loss of appetite taste etc 6 to 7 weeks of 5 day a week radiation later this week what can i expect now at this stage hi paigei had tch as well finished in october and will finish herceptin in july like kimbly i had tch every 3 weeks and then just herceptin every 3 weeks i thought that the was causing the cankers but i still get them every now and then so i think that herceptin might also cause some canker sores i have some muscle aches and pains but they are managed with advil compared to chemo the se from herceptin are minor and tolerable at most i only got one per cycle and i know that it was because i was taking daily doses of collodial silver you can buy it at health food stores my onc knew i was on it it should not interfere with chemo and it is a big help compazine worked for my nausea but unfortunately i had an adverse reaction to it and had to switch to the equally effective but significantly more expensive zolfran there are so many medications out there to control this your onc should have something in their arsenal that works come join us in the taxotere carboplatin herceptin thread there are lots of us on this alternative cocktail okay ganzgirl now please remember that not at all associated with any medical profession i just like to look stuff up on the internet take my opinion as one viewpoint and then make your own decision obviously but i feel the need for a standard disclaimer a little rudimentary research into tamoxifen risks versus ovary removal seems to indicate that tamoxifen has far fewer risks ovary removal seems to carry with it a host of higher risk potentials plus all the problems of forced early menopause like increased risk for osteoporosis and the one source i found a medical source admitted they know all the risks the only risks stated about tamoxifen that i found include standard menopause symptoms and a slightly higher risk of uterine cancer particularly if they are talking 5 years of tamoxifen then the chance of going through a normal menopause to me that seems the better option a lot of the research i follow believes that cancer is an immune system issue according to that way of thinking we all have cancer cells floating about in our bodies a natural mutation that our immune systems should annilhilate for whatever reason missing nutrients toxin overload periods of high stress sometimes our immune system just fails to recognize the cancer cells as bad and kill them off and we get cancer the reason why so many natural practitioners are so virulently against cut poison and burn protocol because they lower the immune system further possibly the reason why many people get major recurrences so soon after getting an all clear or maybe just my personal experience from my family so what i think you should do talk to several professionals talk to your surgeon your oncologist another oncologist a cancer counsellor and a naturopath me i get the surgery myself but just me as for daily life on tamoxifen only been on it for 50 days now the hot flashes night sweats are irritating but work on reducing those once things have calmed down for me i noticed a lack of sex drive or dryness but to be truthful the desire is there but i felt like acting on it because of all this no aches and pains thus far i gained or lost anything maybe a little gain but been recouperating from stuff and not being very active pretty much it and my natural menopause symptoms before the tamoxifen were pretty minor i also think that the ai have similar side effects by the way the side effects started pretty quickly for me so you could always start the tamoxifen and see how it goes for a couple of months then get the surgery if you find it intolerable if you get the surgery forever hi shaah the first chemo infusion is pretty but after it is over you will realize the actual infusion part is not so bad i feel sick until the evening without knowing which chemo regime you will be receiving it is hard to suggest how you might feel they each have different side effects i had fec first which did give me nausea better with zofran and emend agents and taxotere for the last 3 treatments which caused muscle aches and pains but no nausea the aches and pains start until the third day it looks like from your other posts you have already had xeloda oral chemotherapy has a list of most chemo agents and the possible side effects you might want to review the ones you will be on so you know what to expect as for your wig concerns i agree with you a wig for me either i wore scarfs bandanas or a baseball hat and looked pretty cute i think all in your attitude some days are rough initially but after awhile you get used to it just have fun accessorizing you can get matching earrings for instance i got cheap ones in lots of different colors to match my bandanas you just have to try to make the best of a bad situation it will be over before you know it good luck hi everyone sorry i havent been around much i have been in alot of pain this taxol is not agreeing with my body i have the worst arm hand pain i am so depressed over this i hope this pain goes away i dont work and i am at home lounging around most of the time i am in so much pain i take vicodin it doesent seem to help much any sugggestions or anybody else out there on taxol and having bone joint pain i think i will feel better if i know for sure this pain will go away i have treatment tommorow talk to ya soon reeney 77i have been on effexor 75 mg for about 3 years now i was on tamoxifen for 2 years now on femara my hot flashes were horrible and i had alot of anxiety and mild depression before i started the effexor when it all improved greatly i wish i had started it sooner i told my onc i am never going off it apparently there can be bad side effects if you try to go off it cold turkey not worried about that right now it has been a lifesaver for me i would give it a try hi denisei am weeks post taxol i think my taste is ok right about i got a weird after taste ick could even taste it on my lips but yesterday that seemed to be gone my runny bloody nose seems to be a little better but i have had that since the first month of a c back in october my skin is so dry finger nails are a disaster i never went 100 bald just 95 lol had a very fine stick up white buzz very very sparse now hubby says there are a few random white hairs here there that are longer but my head is virtually bald it shines and my legs ache just walking around the grocery store but that said i know the ses are subsiding things are getting better hang in there vintagegal hansaim i just had second infusion of abraxane i also have neuropathy of hands and feet from it this infusion was a 20 reduction of the chemo this time as the doctor does not want it to get worse did you reduce the amount and are yours hands and feet still bad i have a hard time typing as my right hand has two numb fingers in a few days my joint and muscle pain seems to start for a few bad days but overall other than fatigue and gradual hair loss i am doing better than i though hey ladies i am 8 days post diep i love reading your comments and stories share a little more of mine in hopes it will be helpful to someone i was diagnosed at age 45 with stage iiib idc strongly suspicious for inflammatory breast cancer at the time but turned out not to be i had two tumors in my breast the largest 4 x 9 cm and one in the lymph nodes i was a regular mammogrammer and self examiner most months i was in my busy time of year at work and my sister was getting married so i may have missed a self exam i had recently lost 40 lbs i find a lump i found hardness and pain and heat in the side of my breast the docs believe maybe it was partly hidden from self exam due to the adipose tissue i had lost regardless it on the mammogram a year before and suddenly it was 9 cm i spent the 72 hours between diagnosis and 1st onco appointment researching and decided on diep reconstruction this was in june 2011 onco decided i needed chemotherapy first and being her 2 positive meant a year of herceptin had port put in in june but it had to be pulled in october because the scar kept opening poor healing due to avastin treatment i had six rounds of chemo and then complete mastectomy in november of 2011 i had no tissue expander radiation oncologist want it in the way of rads treatment i developed a huge truncal seroma and truncal lymphedema during rads had a preventative hysterectomy and oopherectomy in march 2012 truncal seroma had massive infection requiring 4 days in hospital may 2012 finished herceptin in june 2012 gained 40 lbs during treatment due to instant menopause failed thyroid gland tamoxifen and then femara plastic surgeons refuse to do diep but really wanted me to drop the 40 lbs for best results of diep and wanted me to wait at least 8 months post rads so began a year of work to lose weight and loosen adhered mastectomy scar from chest wall and with lots of help i was able to do both and had my diep 8 days ago my 6 hour surgery ended up being 10 i was in hot room 78 with hot blanket bear hugger for 48 hours after doppler checks for flap blood flow every hour for 48 hrs ice chip diet for close to 48 hrs after in case i needed to go back in to or liquid diet for another 24 i very interested in eating the first 48 anyway biggest struggle for me post surgical is always pain meds my body thinks most narcotics and antinausea meds are pure poison this time we figured out that a dose of compazine followed one hour by a dose of dilaudid worked pretty well i did compazine and nucynta at home the first couple of days and then quit for just tylenol and motrin i would rather tolerate a fair amount of pain than be strung out on narcotics they are just not my friends so i am doing all right for me this has been the most difficult surgery of the last two years in terms of recovery even though i was probably in the best physical shape going in i was back to work 2 weeks after mx 3 weeks after hx i cannot imagine going back right now i had a lift done on my right breast and it is fine diep belly is sore and swelly but tolerable but my diep breast is insanely large swollen to at least 4 times what it should be and very uncomfortable still has a drain and is filling times a day wait for follow up so those are my basic facts is anybody else having crazy swelling thanks girls bailey 5 years since diagnosis been on arimidex or rather the generic anastrazole for 4 years now i was told at the beginning of the ai to take 6 months at a time and try to get through the ses and worked for me had acupuncture for joint pain and been helping enormously pain free i stay away from soy products if i know there is soy in them also never eat sushi or sprouts i have lymphedema but think the acupuncture is helping with that too i should wear my sleeve but too hot zjrosenthal worry about not having the total 18 herceptin i think i was one short and i had delays along the way had most of them and that should be ok congrats to others who have made this journey not an easy one but there is a lot of life to live yet hello lovely ladies i believe i signed on and saw this topic this is my story i just had a whole body bone scan today and am doing the old waiting game i was on tamoxifen then arimidex for a year and then back on tamoxifen for a year due to bp and cholesterol problems w arimidex about 6 months ago i was put on femara i was fine until the third month and woke up one day crippled went off for two weeks started acupuncture felt better but not great and started aromasin almost 3 months into aromasin it happened again my are good along with ap levels but i had to go off the aromasin a little over two weeks ago had to go for a second opinion to get my onc to get moving on the scan i had one done yrs ago that showed some arthritis been thinking fibro i was not sleeping but thought it was a from aromasin the pain travels sometimes more upper sometimes lower body parts been actually telling the acupuncurist were to put the needles because it hurts in areas that checking i had been doing better for the past few days but tonight in pain mostly hips to feet two years ago i had a botched reconstruction that led to back to back surgeries and a major infection it took me a year to bounce back i had the surgery because a year after my first mastectomy they did an mri on my remaining breast and thought they saw cancer talk about trauma after a mammo us and mri guided biopsy it was not cancer i opted to have the other breast removed and expanders put in i ended up having a seroma and an emergency surgery and the idiot ps took the infected expander out and put it back in guess he forgot to bring a new one with him picline went in and i sat giving myself 2 hours of iv antibiotics for weeks from home so here i sit somewhere between bone mets and fibro yup the gift that keeps on giving they told me today my doctor should have the results by monday i hate the waiting i knew this would happen so i planned a trip to for an overnight and a stixs concert i refuse to get myself all worked up till i know because i was a basket case with the mri thing and it turned out to be nothing then always the chance that just the aromatase my pc said she dx me on the fibro unless been off of them for a few months so thanks for all the wonderful info anything else you can send my way would be greatly appreciated hoping we all get to a pain free zone take care all and thanks for letting me vent going to go try and give sleep a try jo taxotere definitely caused watery eyes for me it was like i was crying constantly bleary vision too i used moisture drops for the blurry vision but not really sure it helped i was to laid out to worry about it allurbad lmao i will always be singing that during my steroid high days from now on cindy good luck with the last one and hope your trip to nyc is a one in a lifetime melrose thanks again for all the info as i look at the finish line for chemo the reality of surgery and rads is sitting in mariposa your beauty shines from the outside and from within accept all your compliments patricia whenlife my eyebrows eyelashes still remain although i can count each hair no change so far on taxol becki thanks for the scarf website i ordered one today as well taxol update today is my first day since sunday for feeling better the pain was maybe 5 less this time but nothing to write home about looking at my new poochy belly and trying to mentally say the dryer again yep i also have noticed an enhanced effect with alcohol i finally had a chocolate martini after months and months of no alcohol and i really noticed a difference and quickly already sensitive to alcohol and drink rarely to occasionally by the way i have recurring neck stiffness and joint pain that moves around in ways that i experience before tamoxifen i just keep stretching and exercising to reduce the discomfort and unfortunately i now have thinning eyelashes and brows again this after a return to nice lashes and brows following chemo trying not to notice if the hair on my head looks thinner been catching up on all the posts wow lots of activity been very achy and somewhat nausaus again had tx 3 last tuesday i am looking forward to when i can finally say i am half over i have one more ac treatment then switch to taxol i hear the are quitedifferent nydeb 48 i think it was you who asked how my daughter did at her gymnastics competition earlier this month i was very proud of her even though she did not have her best meet she did however finish first on the balance beam for her age group i am proud to say she is the level 8 junior b balance beam champion for the state of maryland unfortunately she tried too hard in the other events to win and she ended up having some falls oh well she did however qualify for the regional competition that is next month so i will be able to cheer for her once more i wore my wig for the first time that day and received many compliments also i love your lap dog once again i am too many posts behind to respond individually i do hope everyone enjoyed their weekend we took the younger two kids to the museum of natural history on saturday it was very crowded and rainy but it was fun to get out and about i came home exhausted and very achy and proceeded to sleep the afternoon away it was worth it to get the kids out of the house i love all the pets pics my goldfish stay still for the camera so i am unable to send a good picture of her i will keep trying though lol chrisc 433 i am also hoping that the t is better than the ac i hear it is just different though i have heard that we feel nausea but will be more fatigued i think i could handle that i am not looking forward to one more ac but i am looking forward to being half over after the next treatment i hope you are doing better today luv 2sing this may be too late but i love the idea of the red dress red wrap and hoop earrings you will knock them out happy early birthday probably forget by next week chemo brain janet 0527 amazing how much better you feel once the hair is gone especially when it is on your terms i still have little spiky metal like hair i am not sure why it all fallen out i think i look like a baby monkey but everyone else says i look beautiful weird when i walk in from of a mirror i still think not me pattib i never really liked my hair either but i am really curious now how it will look when it grows back i may wish for my old style again i think i will have some fun with short and sassy hairstyles for a while curly straight dark light only time will tell michelleinsj i know if i am being treated any differently but today in the grocery store i was asked if i wanted to make a donation to a cancer fund i was wearing a baseball hat and i took my hat off and said made a lot of donations in the last few months it was kind of nice to know i being treated any differently right then have to pay closer attention when i go out for dinner sorry to hear about your cat pickle 141 loved your jokes keep them coming laughter is the best medicine i am finally going to physical therapy for my arm at the end of the month it has been feeling worse lately it feels very fatigued and i am not able to stretch it as much as i was i am concerned about lympodema but at the same time i know i have been overcautious with it will i ever be able to do all the things i used to do with my arm hand i am nervous about that the kids go back to school tomorrow and i am looking forward to trying to organize the house i am hoping to have more energy this week since it is my bye week you all are a great source of information and support thanks for being there for me cyndi excuse me for posting this a second time but i originally posted this in the wrong section on arimidex for 3 years used to waking up with aches and pains this morning however something has me concerned area of right axillary armpit side tenderness when applying deodorant i was with idc of left breast 1 cm stage 1 no lymph nodes in 2010 lumpectomy radiation and arimidex at initial diagnosis in 2010 also had an mri and nothing was detected other than the left breast cancer no subsequent problems i go for regular 6 month checkups mammograms as directed and my gp also closely monitors me in this regard last bilateral mammo was 13 normal followed same day by complete bilateral breast and axillary exams nothing detected no tenderness or concerns my annual physical with gp was 13 and gp also performed bilateral breast and axillary exams nothing detected and no tenderness very aware of my body and have noticed no breast or axillary concerns until immediately after i woke today i was applying deodorant and felt mild to moderate tenderness under the right armpit not my lumpectomy side when i press in the middle of my armpit i tell if muscular or nodal but i performed several exams this morning and felt no lump or abnormality just the area of tenderness if i been with bc in 2010 simply had written this off as muscular strain i recall straining it but i rarely recall things like that especially with arimidex aches and pains i do often sleep on that side and woke on that side this morning hubby has said a fitful sleeper migraines and am often found sleeping with hands holding my head or moving my arms i took 800 mg advil 30 minutes ago not for pain tenderness but to see if tenderness would go away and have been dr since to summarize noticed only this morning while putting on deodorant and examined myself every which way and feel no lump slightly tender when i press on it and perhaps when i lift my arm though less but no lumps felt i do primarily sleep on this side but remember nothing unusual i never exercise due to chronic migraine pain and depression so even stretching hard or lifting filling back of refrigerator playing with dog or an unusual sudden movement could cause very mild injury straining to fill the back of the refrigerator to fill with bottles is perhaps all i remember terrified nonetheless if i call my onc likely have me come in because doctors never hold off on any type of complaint at this hospital so terrified physically anxious but do always think the worst and have all my life any advice please help such a baby about this so terrified update noticed doing minimal chores such as loading the dishwasher very mild discomfort in that area log in to post a reply thanks for sharing about your oncotype bc is a funny thing so many varying degrees my onc said the same thing for me if i would have had to do chemo it would have been tcand 4 rounds i know you were glad of just the 4 rounds read ac is much tougher i have heard good things about the seems like they are more effective than tamoxifen i will see my med onc july 3rd and i know i will get the tamoxifen prescription i am nervous about it though my sister had difficulties with both tam and ai and i have met one bc survivor who did well on tamoxifen others have had relapses or severe se but i am 2 weeks out of radiation and have had 2 3 good days fatigue set in when i stopped walking my rad techs scared me about the boost markings and not letting them disappear i sweat when i walk and always had problems keeping the whole breast markings intact they fussed at me all the time so when they stressed the boost markings i stopped walking my usual miles times weekly the last week of the boost i just really care about the markings because i had a nice red shaded area that was clearly marked the area they were zapping i am so glad you have to have radiation the first week of rads i wished i had gotten a mastectomy and even told everyone even the rad dr that maybe i should get a mast and quit rads but i made it and i seem to be healing and resting helps the swelling and pain go away i am off to a big trip tomorrow and hope i fatigue i will be on a golf course hours a day and i suspect on my feet but it will be a happy time and i bought several loose shirts that are stylish yet what me and my friend call pregnant shirts but really i care if someone asks me when due just kidding but i stand something hugging my bc boob i modeled one of the shirts for my husband and he was encouraging about you have any problems wearing tops now let me know how the arimidex goes god bless amber polly and diane 48 i have always taken emend and decaron withmy a c and very rare had any naseau i know they give emend when your on taxol but i do have a prescript for decadron i also have thining brows and lashes but happy i stillhave them maybe the t will make the rest go has anyones fingernails near cuticle turned black some of mine have another thing i noticed whenever i take a deep breath i have to cough anyone else maybe the hot sticky weather brahna good for you to be done i like you had little s e hugs to all rose i think i recall that an rn is that correct i do not get compazine ativan or zofran right now are those all drugs should i ask my doc to prescribe them in addition to the emend it sounds like the emend is not a stand alone nausea drug when it comes to a c that the aloxi during infusion are the only nausea drugs taking with taxol i have found that pretty good with the taxol on days 1 2 as well days that are the hardest as far as fatigue joint pain go not really pain but more of a dull ache i did post my taxol experience a bit further back in this thread find it repost it for you what about the heart pounding is that a common se of a c that must be an awful feeling had a bit of tightness in my chest since friday some low back pain when i sit nothing severe just noticeable i do have help with my son on the days that i really need it i get my infusions on thursdays so by the time the weekend rolls around feeling wiped out my husband is home to help out i usually try to send him to his grandparents or with a friend on mondays following treatment as well thanks rose well ladies another busy day around here just got finished eating mushroom stroganoff sp and spinach it was very good thank god ub can cook or i would be in serious trouble nancy we had the same rain here it was relentless all day where are you in ny had to go out for a present for my soon to be 11 year old nephew and i got drenched all about basketball this year so i went to the party is tomorrow sue when are your by the way thanks for saving me a piece of pie when are you going to see your dad mel i am so thankful all this rain we are getting snow omg we would have well over a foot by now if it were i hope you and lisa stay safe and warm ulla tamoxifen is no picnic for me i get terrible joint bone pain my oncky has switched me to armidex sp because i am post menapousal and i hear that is even worse i hate bootface sue you better get to bed early tonight missy be checking in later to make sure ae also speak to ais but i have similar ses from tamoxifen as flashes achiness and insomnia which of course translates to fatigue the next day i tried evening primrose oil for a while then melatonin then soy tablets recently per my oncologist and gyn nothing has really helped significantly going to ask my gyn for more suggestions when i go in october my oncologist feels that my ses now are more related to my loss of ovaries than from the tamox and i have to agree as my ses were much milder before my surgery i take ibuprophen aleve or extra strenth tylenol for the generalized achiness sorry to hear you are having such a bad time topsey and lizcat i had zoladex with my primary bc now have bone mets at the age of 41 and the first 12 months were awful loads of hot flushes i thought never wear long sleeves or synthetic material ever again the 2nd twelve months quite so bad but i was glad when i came off it after 2 years i was still on tamoxifen so i know that it the cause i give any real suggestions though i certainly had to keep away from any plant oestrogens that are often used in complementary alternative menopause relief on a different note a friend of mine who was suffering big time with her natural menopause was also put on a low dose anti depressant maybe prozac like lizcat and this definitely helped her when the symptoms were so bad she is a teacher so again suffered badly with hot flushes but had nowhere to hide i hope someone else can help a bit more than me nicky morning i am on tamoxifen and dont seem to be have any i gained so much weight throu baby and chemo hoping not to put anymore on hot flushes but they started before i started taking it have second herceptin this week and its a real faff going back into hospital again but at elast i dont feel apnts after and its good excuse to sit down planning on going back to work next eyar poss only p t but im quite excited ninja you sound like ur having a nightmare which is rubbish i hope seroma buggers off soon cos they are painful has anyone else had flu jab i have a bloody great red lump on my arm good day to u all xx i am an athlete triathlon and mountain bike racing and have been on tamoxifen for 9 months i noticed the leg cramps occur regularly whenever i exercise moderately or hard and long lately i have noticed that when mycalf muscles are fatigued during and after a long bike ride i can see them constantly twitching found that magnesium can prevent and treat my leg cramps i use natural calm mg powder orally and or mg oil spray depending on how fast i need relief i rub mg oil spray right on the leg muscles immediately after a hard workout or race and take mg powder orally every day thati exercise if i forget the can get horrible cramps that occur anywhere in my legs andare sometimes so painful they make me cry i was 1st dx in 2001 then had a recurrence in 2005 her 2 er pr i saw my onc today for routine 3 mo check up i mentioned i have been so tired for several months i have no energy at all i feel more tired than when i went through chemo and radiation she is checking my thyroidand ordering a muga scan i had routine muga scans when i was doing herceptin last one was dec 2006 i was wondering if anyone developed heart problems a year or two after completing treatment i also had ac both times also wondering if radiation can cause thyroid problems years later appreciate any info you can provide thank you log in to post a reply annie that is hysterical about your cats jan i peel the peaches and quarter them put into gallon ziplock freezer bag label and freeze when i defrost in fridge they break down further breakdown when cooking so no need to chop up easier and they always have beautiful color in the jar drove by farmers market today and the peaches are coming in early this year ladies starting chemo constipation is miserable i took and still take a probiotic capsule i also drank kefir and ate yogurt sounds a bit over board but i had issues w chemo lost nine lbs the first week i trained for my first triathlon for none months and lost only five lbs so chemo did a number on me i think most people react that badly when i went in the next day for my nuelasta shot the chemo nurse asked me if i had taken anything before treatment i said do you mean like crack sign me up if you do feel poorly go in for fluids i had them with every nuelasta shot i went in three times week sometimes for fluids it helped a lot nuelasta has a program that offers financial assistance somehow pays part of your insurance deductible ask about it not a need based program nuelasta did cause me a lot of pain and i have heard that from many ladies who have had it some take vicodin for the pain i found that doing gentle yoga stretching and forward bend yoga poses helped me to keep that pain away if you want additional info on that i can recommend a great yoga dvd one other crack pot idea for chemo when i had taxotere i iced my hands and feet to prevent neuropathy the chemo nurses rolled their eyes at me but it worked i also saw an acupuncturist after every chemo and it helped tremendously now you all think some kind of tree hugging boulder hippy but really a very high maintenance kind of girl i even shave my legs daily lol my prayers are with you all t was the oncologist you spoke to a medical oncologist or radiation oncologist if the former i agree with beesie that concerned that he or she would say that tamoxifen was necessary rather than saying she would recommend it but giving you a choice if it was a radiation oncologist i would definitely suggest you try to meet with a medical oncologist i found my meeting with the medical oncologist to discuss tamoxifen extremely helpful she was able to discuss risk reduction because i was 40 when diagnosed so young in breast cancer terms like you she was more inclined to encourage me to try the tamoxifen but she would have been ok either way she also was able to discuss the likelihood of side effects in my individual case for example she thought given that i had been on the pill for many many years with no issues the risk of clotting was minimal in my case on the other hand she thought because of some emotional side effects i had from the pill early on she thought i might have some issues of that kind i decided to try tamoxifen on the theory that if i had too many problems i could quit and because for me personally should i have to face breast cancer again in the future i would feel better knowing i had done everything to prevent it i am a very risk averse person i have been on tamoxifen forover a yearnow with very few side effects i did have a couple days of extreme anxiety about a week in but been fine then maybe slightly more anxious than normal but hard to tell if that is tamoxifen or life also my libido is definitely lower than it was when i on the pill but similar to what it was when i was on the pill who knew that my sex drive was artificially low all these years argh hope that too personal just trying to provide complete information the medical oncologist who is following me a different once since i had my treatments in california but live in rural hawaii has me do bloodwork to confirm that my liver function is ok every 3 months or so the first time it was a little high but has been ok since then depending where you are in africa it might be hard to find a doctor there to follow you if you are in a very rural area for example so that is something to think about anyway i hope this helps good luck with your like navymom who mentioned in above post it amazes me how different mo or hospitals have different reasonings my hospital iced for taxol but i was told that was to prevent loosing finger toe nails i still lost 3 toe nails my chemo nurse had told me that my hospital use cold caps for exactly the reason meadow suggested meadow and mommom i agree totally each of us has to do the absolute most we feel comfortable the best information we are given and not regret or feel badly afterwards i should mention that i did get neuropathy in both fingers and toes but learned to put up with it as it is not severe and has seemed to improve a bit with time post menopausal and had a small stage i tumor i tried arimidex and deal with all the side effects which were nausea vomitting and vertigo dizziness the benefit to me in taking arimidex was about 4 or 5 and i was still above 90 that the cancer return i also tried tamoxifen with the same problems and throw in some depression to boot i quit taking that as well my quality of life was more important than adding another 4 or 5 to my reduction rate i might add that this was against my recommendation i was lucky that my tumor was so small less than one cm and my margins were 6 cm all round it was a very difficult decision for me to make i struggled with it for many months read a lot of research and decided what i feel was best for me one thing though i never recommend that anyone follow my decisions just sharing what i chose to do this was about 3 years ago and still cancer free hugs bren donnasac welcome to the group sorry we had to meet this way but you will find a wonderful group of ladies here that are very caring and supportive i have been on tamoxifen for 6 months and hardly have a hot flash i tried effexor and the side effects were really bad i was having a hard time sleeping but i had terrible toe joint pains and burning stabbing pains in the bc boob i went to a pain specialist and am now taking amytriptyline it has taken my pain away and is giving me wonderful sleep what i am saying is maybe you should stop taking effexor and see what happens without it you do have to remember that you have to stop it gradually i know some of the other ladies will come along and share their experiences come back often and ask all the questions you need to we do tend to have some fun along with way too i had numb lips from the benadryl it would start within a minute of when give it to me feet peeling from taxol but better now than when i started lost one toenail i have to say i minded the wig as much as i thought i would in this 90 degree weather but my energy level is flagging badly and i think the heat and the drugs combined today i just want to really not in the cards hi guys glad to see people checking in here yes been a year wow i believe it had my scans as well all came back fine stressful not much new and exciting i did post a picture in hair hair hair a week ago or so i try to remember to do that because where i was 6 months ago looking for hope also started livestrong at the ymca if you have one in your town look into it because i work full time it was hard to fit me in classes so i was assigned a trainer for 12 weeks plus a free membership during that time wow been awesome chemo really does a number on our muscles i had no much mass i lost i am taking tamoxifen and those symptoms hot flashes super vivid dreams sometimes lucid dreams are enough of a pain to pop in here searching for solutions plus the inablity to lose weight which sucks i gained much maybe 5 pounds but all in my love handles literally have been working out 1 hr a day for 3 weeks and cut calories to 1200 and did not lose one pound or one iota of an inch ugh another nycgirl i have moved on a bit obviously not desperate for information as i was before and during treatment but i still check here every now and then canuckmom i hope life is treating you well last post i remember from you was a picture of your beautiful self getting your last chemo seems like a long time ago now glad you are doing well happy summer to all of you hi renee i am in treatment now 3 cycles of chemo done 3 to go then rads plus herceptin for 1 year well anyway when i went for a visit to onc i was complaining about my and he suggested i was depressed and lexapro it kind of suprised me yeah i am sad who be going thru this been taking it i agree rather not be taking anything more than is absolutely necessary rather take something as needed and be done with it when i feel better i take tramadol for pain from rheumatoid arthritis as needed and was told by pharmacist not to take lexapro if i continue to use the tramadol great like to hear what the sisters have to say about it thanks for opening this topic hugs debbie chelsea i am going to be perfectly honest with you you are right now overwhelmed with anxiety about everything every step of your treatment this is not a good context for making important medical decisions you really really need some support from a professional all side effects are real but the perspective you need is 1 how likely are they and 2 are they reversible if they happen the vast majority of side effects from tamoxifen are very rare and reversible so if they are bad you can go off the drug i had a small cataract going into tamoxifen and i guess it got somewhat worse during my five years on the drug but still not so bad that i notice or need surgery to correct it and i am now over a year past going off tamoxifen my sense for the cataracts is that it is very very rare and then only an issue at all for folks who would get them anyway since i already had it going in and i was 42 when i started tamoxifen so very young to get cataracts i was pretty much a sitting duck but here i am six years later and still without vision symptoms i have never heard of anyone actually getting heart failure from tamoxifen and that certainly be an issue for someone who is young and without congenital heart defects the important thing is to be about this when making your decision how great is your risk of a recurrence how likely is it that you will have disruptive side effects remember the vast majority of women do fine on tamoxifen hoping that i fall in the group with peggy and denise i just finished my first prescription of anastrozole manufactured by accord some ses hot flashes additional joint pain stiffness and insomnia enough to impact my life but not show stoppers as of yet my doctor said the ai is optional for me as my risk is already low i am planning on trying for at least 3 months to see what the ses are for me my refill at target rx happened to be the teva brand this time dr felt that being active and exercising were more important in my case if i find myself less active because of se i should stop taking the ai or try another hello all and happy new year to you xx not been on site since 23rd dec had 4th epi on 24th and have felt so very poorly and depressed xmas and new year were a total wash out days consisted of getting out of bed laying on sofa trying to eat and willing the day away so i would hopefully feel better the day after which the case have actually only felt better today that getting dressed a massive struggle have rung bcc whose assured me it is all normal and epi is harsh so harsh side effects i have a very croaky voice though not sore throat have gone from constipation to diarohhea to constipation again trying to use all the various medication from the hospital as best i can but cant seem to get it right and at the mo my poor bum hurts soo much too i want to go gosh what we have to go through mandy it does sound like this is your veins hardening know about the swollen ankles though are they still the same know about hairloss on tax either sorry not much help jill how you feeling hope you having caught hubbies cold hope your final epi today went ahead and pray that you feel as awful as i have felt i so hope that what i have read about xeloda being easier is true i am so tired of this and cannot see a light at the end of the tunnel at the moment big hugs to you all xx hi i am mary bell lol dx grade 3 infiltrating ductal carcinoma er pr her 2 nodes was prepared for a mastectomy got a lumpectomy seen by rad doctors had to be mastectomy too close to the margins start lobbying for a double oncologist determined to do chemo so i acquiesce three doses of doxorubicin red devil and one dose of taxotere which puts me in bed for a month with neutropenia sores in every orifice and stops the chemo double mastectomy 25 rad treatments went back to work felt great for almost a year get a sharp pain in my chest chest ct scan pet scan finally surgeon does biopsy under ultrasound and the cancer has returned or was never eradicated in the first place dx small soft tissue nodule in the left anterior breast near the midline recurrent metastatic disease involving the chest wall and left internal mammary chain put on xeloda 4000 mg per day 2 weeks on one week off also monthly intravenous of pamidronate did 4 sessions weeks of xeloda stopped xeloda last month because of progression every kind of scan again progression in the same spots none in lungs or liver starting rad treatments tomorrow for 20 sessions advised by radiologist i still should be on hormonal treatment even if arimidex did not work put on aromasin not happy with oncologist so getting second opinion will consider abraxane chemo in the fall if more progression but am not jumping on it right now want my summer thanks for sharing that article isabel interesting and encouraging it is nice to be reminded in the midst of intensive treatment how lucky we are to have herceptin kadcylaan update on my taxol rash they did not prescribe oral steroids for me last week instead i got a topical steroid clobetasol and immersed my hands in ice water for my taxol treatment not just ice packs but fully immersed in ice water for one hour it was unbearable at first because my hands were so sensitive to begin with so i kept them close to the water and kept putting the icy washcloths over them until they became numb and i was able to soak them the results were amazingly good i should also note that they reduced my taxol dose by 20 in general i feel better this week i have more energy and my diarrhea has finally subsided so i think the dose reduction was helpful for me i do have quite a bit of hyper pigmentation on my arms and face but the dermatologist was reassuring that she will be able to help me with that when chemotherapy is completed not sure how they fix that but i will be happy to see that resolved hope everyone is doing well having joint and leg pain from taxol ugh taking percocet does claritin work for joint and bone pain with taxol i thought that it only worked with neulasta shots hey ladies had my 2nd taxol infusion on thursday i tell ya this stuff is taking me down had 4 ac infusions since july but the after starting taxol my hair has fallen out in such a large amount sad so blessed and feel lucky to have hair i feel like a complainer talking about more hair falling out i get it i have hair but this is a lot of money spent hard the one thing trying to control just hard cancer sux has anyone used nioxin products to help hair faster hlya and hvv i have experienced male pattern baldness since menopause when i began using minoxidil it worked for me for years my hair never was as thick as when i was younger now i am 72 however i had a fair amount of regrowth and the shedding did stop fast forward to my diagnosis in 2009 and i was put on tamoxifen within 6 months i began to lose hair and lots of it even though i was still using the minoxidil i was so despondent but i continued the tamoxifen i was scared to stop it but within another 8 months my hair began to regrow lots of new hair then i found that i was allergic to the propylene glycol in the minoxidil it made my head itch subsequently i found another product call dualgen 5 which has no pg and have been using it for 6 months now without an itching problem and the regrowth continues i know just how depressing hair loss can be so i hope some of this information helps you sending good thoughts to you good afternoon ladies wow i had a couple of pages to get through amazing what all of us have already been through and are still reaching towards i go for treatment 4 tomorrow seems like yesterday i was on here freaked out about loosing my hair lol i still havent lost eyebrows eyelashes or my darn period as of yet i am switching to doxotaxol tomorrow i sure hope its easier than fec i had so many side effects with fec nausea throwing up deep depression sheesh i am going to get some claritin as one of the side effects for this is the bone pain i am assuming it is very similiar to the taxol you have all seemed to swithc too must just be a canadian thing i guess i have promised myself no decision making during this time i truly have crazy brain lol i write it on my calendar for the 8 days following treatment to remind myself that my thoughts are a result of the chemicals in my brain so i write crazy day 1 crazy day 2 and so on lol just to get me through and i can count them down till i mostly return to normal does anyone else find they just cry more and everything is so hyper sensitive i am a walking pms vessel let me tell you lol i have rads after this too but i am not too worried about that part of this journey yes it takes up alot of time but its short and shouldnt be too bad as far as se go heres hoping ok well i am at work and lunch break is over so i will check in and let you all know how the se are with the big switch hugs and love to all you ladieskymn josie unfortunately joint pain is a known se of tamoxifen more common with the ais but tamox can sure cause it too i have had a bad time with this it start right away i was on it for several months before the pain started but it got worse and worse to the point where it was seriously interfering with my life by a year on tamox the doc says i can try switching to an ai the chemopause is apparently real menopause now according to the blood test but leery of those they have even a worse reputation plus i greatly fear osteoporosis so for now toughing it out trying to stay on the tamox as long as i can stand it but the pain is not fun my mo recommended an ai for years and then switch to tamoxifen as he felt there were some treatment advantages i went for a second opinion at an nci designated research center and the doctor did not feel there was much difference in outcomes changing the order and felt going with tamoxifen first would give me time to work on your bones i am osteopenic and also have a strong family history of heart disease so want my weight cholesterol etc to be as low as i can get them before starting the ai my mo concurred so been on tamoxifen for a little over a year and will make the switch as planned i also read a number of the studies the mo referred to myself and did not feel the differences in which order you took the drugs were always significant but that you had both over time seemed more important my internist has offered the option of starting on one of the bone building drugs a year or so before i switch to an ai i have dexa scans once a year and have held steady but not improved my vitamin d levels though have actually fallen in spite of daily supplements so upped the amount to iu a day and am getting out in the sun lonnie a lot of my hair is white too especially on top i plan on getting it colored in 3 months mersee so happy you finished taxol too bad you were so sick glad the antibiotics helped i have been full of energy until just now i was out about yesterday after i was done by noon with my last taxol today i cooked did house work ran some errands and went for a walk now i feel tired hope i sleep well tonight enjoy the rest of your weekend ladies hi i had a check up today dx a year ago and when i mentioned all the aches and pains depression and hot flushes i was getting with tamoxifen the consultant prescribed megace which is progesterone and supposed to help hot flushes my head is all over the place and i got home then started to wonder if he meant instead of tamoxifen as he mentioned stopping it tamoxifen for a month i will ring the bc nurse tomorrow to confirm what he said but wondered if anyone else is on this as i never see it mentioned love debbie hi robin i was talking to my onc a couple of weeks ago about what happens after tamoxifin and he told me that femara might be a possiblity for me i told him that i had heard and was worried about the side effects of joint pain caused by femara he told me he treated the joint pain with vitamin d suppliments and that in most cases it helped those with problems might be worth talking to your onc about it would hate to have her go off of it if it is fixable love kim bettye welcome you and i are on the same regime i started the taxol on feb 13 i had dose 5 today so far starting with dose 3 and 4 i have had some very mild nausea two days after receiving chemo and some increase in my chronic back pain on day 3 4 post chemo i did start off anemic and received 3 procrit shots to stimulate my rbc production it worked as today i did not need another shot of procrit that indicates my hemaglobin is back up over 11 hope you continue to do well i was told my hair might just thin but mine was coming out so fast after dose 2 or day 18 post chemo that i had my best friend clip it all off it was just such a mess i want to be shedding all over my patients at work i am a nurse in a recovery room pacu take care and keep coming back i have learned so much from all these wonderful chemocruisers everyone is so generous with their knowledge and experience catherine would you believe this is the 3rd post i have had to repeat because i somehow have lost them i know you mentioned a way to retrieve disappeared messages will you repeat please sorry i am too tired to go back and find it you may also be too tired to send out the info now and if that is the case worry about it i know it was alt plus someother keys hope you are feeling ok take care glad you are having some warm weather there in denver catherine good night to all chemocruisers sammie kay comforting to know in the same boat as me i was told that chemo would likely put me through an early menopause and my periods stopped during treatment then came back with the period from hell on my very last day of rads so much for celebrating the end of treatment i had to cancel going out to a concert as i was feeling so crap since then been very erratic sometimes nothing for 3 months finished treatment at end of last jan i was told that the nearer you are in age to the natural menopause the less likely they are to come back i had a routine blood test at my last appointment with the oncologist in november and she said she should be able to tell whether or not i was pre or got the results last week and still so i get to go through the whole hot flushes thing again that i got with chemo to be honest i was kind of hoping seen the back of having periods like you fairfield triple negative so not on tamoxifen or any ongoing treatment just lots of crossed fingers i think those on hormone therapy will still not get periods ali hello everyone i am 54 had a lumpectomy in 2009 chemo and radiation therapy in 2010 go for pet ct scans every six months and am now in my last year of arimidex tamox x 3 and ar x2 years i have gained 11 kilos most of it around my middle which is like being pregnant all over again i have always been slim and very fit so it depresses me terribly i now also have osteopenia in my lumbar region and my torn acl and meniscii have never felt as painful my doctors say whether i will shed the weight when i go off the medication because the menopausal effects may have set in too but i hope i can encourage others here with the following gone off alcohol completely work out six times a week 3xspin cycling 1 pilates and 2 sessions i control my diet much but ought to i have not shed a single gram nor an inch around my huge middle but i feel lighter both in my head and otherwise i fit into old clothes again but do feel the new ones slipping on more easily just wanted to send everyone my best wishes and hope this encourages everyone and keeps us all going best wishes all round i developed neuropathy in my toes from taxol also on arimidex been 2 years exactly since i ended chemo and my neuropathy is 90 percent better although i still wear socks with shoes the only thing that has made them feel better is massage which is why i love getting pedicures so much it seems like it stimulates the nerves or something hi lexislove i have been in a similar dilemna to yours i am an intermediate metabolizer of tamoxifen but was also concerned about not being an effective metabolizer my onc suggested doubling the dose of tamoxifen which scared me or staying on zoladex with ai for 5 years i had also heard that ai can stimulate the ovaries i felt the only way forward for me was ooph and then move to ai after all i could be another 15 years away from the natural menopause and when is it safe to come off zoladex my surgeon told me that ai is a better treatment than tamoxifen and said at my age ooph also has benefits but carries risk to heart and bones i decided to have ooph which i had 2 days ago it was easy compared to breast surgery and now i will switch to ai next week i know if i have done the right thing but i feel comfortable with the decision i have made which is the most important thing hi ladies just wondering if anybody has any insight on the difference between a c treatments and taxol herceptin treatments i have received two a c treatments and have been really nauseous afterwards for days and wondering hoping if taxol will be any better prepared for the weight gain with taxol but would like to avoid the extreme nausuea if anyone has any ideas suze carren i did taxotere too and one od the side effects is eye twitching not sure if you were aware or not i think i loss my hair after treatment 3 and they were 3 weeks a part it is really nerve wracking but once it is gone it gets easier the anticipation drove me crazy

hat or cold so dont know if i have burnt it while eating love carol i thought i posted something earlier but apparently i hit the wrong button liz of you and your cruise but very happy for you just the same i wait to hear all about it dana sorry about your wig and you just go on and be as sappy as you want join you jo sorry for the rough time having i hope it last long and be feeling good soon brenda that stinks about how long the radiation is taking i thought it was supposed to be quick i met with my doctor today and got the okay for taxotere 3 on thursday yay only three weeks left after that and then be done with chemo been having a horrible time sleeping so i tried my ambien worked great but pretty leary about liking it too much so my onc gave me some lunesta samples today anyone else use that after a horrible night of tossing and turning hoping it will work well i just got bit by a mosquito i get a mosquito bite all summer long now that fall i get bit up with that band night at the football stadium tonight the middle junior and high school bands all perform and feeling good only a little tired one more thing you know how the gray hairs are less ruly than the normal hairs last night there was one sticking out so i decided to pull it with the tweezers and measure it it was nearly an inch long if only the rest of my hair was that long starting to look a bit like a hedgehog lol hope you all have a good evening and a great tomorrow jen karyll i have finished 3 of 4 taxotere cytoxan and the eye issues have been the worst side effect for me in hind sight i would use the natural tears eye drops 4 to 6 times per day and the refresh pm eye ointment at night before the burning eyes happens and if you wear contact lenses i would avoid wearing them during taxotere txs although i seem to one of the few to have this problem and i am hungry but i cannot taste anything m i know tamoxifen has someserious but my surgeon summed it up for me i will get the biggest bang for the buck with tamox she said it would be more effective than the chemo andrads in my case yes i asked if i could skip chemo rads short answer wasno i am one of those women that have never gone through a pregnancy so she pretty much felt too much estrogen is whatcaused my cancer after reading through all the materials i felt ok with starting tamox actually i started the day before i started rads both my chemo and radsoncs wanted me to start it right away aftermy lab workdetermined i was still perimenopausal he said i was absolutely to be religious about myannual pap and wanted to start me on some drugs to counter the potential bone loss my bone density test showed i have ostopenia already after reading the from those drugs i said no i had terriblebone on chemo with neulasta in nov when i see him again going to ask for a pt consult tomake sure my exercise routine includeseffectiveweight bearing exercises plus i increased my calcium intake to 1200 mg along with my vitamin d the only se had from tamox is more frequent hot flashes i started at the end of august initially they were very intense now they are notas overwhelming to me certainly more frequent than prior to chemo i hadan increase in frequency when chemopause started all hormone related my younger sister was just diag with uterine cancer in sept so going to speak with my onc about his recommendation on doing a hysterectomy if you learn of alternatives please pass on the info thanks for all the compliments on my post chemo hairdo still a little too edgy for me in light it sure looks gray oh well hair not complaining christy sorry to hear about your onc hopefully you will find a new one that you really like been on tamoxifen for almost a year now i get all the crappy menopausal side effects and i still get to see aunt flo every ding dong month yippee for me what do i win vickisam as for chemo carrie my oncologist explained it to me that the farther away you are from natural menopause when you do chemo the less likely that it will push you into menopause 41 and did 4 rounds of tc last year i only got my period about every 2 months while i was doing chemo but within 3 months of finishing aunt flo was comin every month again never discussed pregnancy with my oncologist not really a concern for my girlfriend and me traci good morning that is one welcome mimosa thanks guys and thank you kathy thinking of you hunky i hope that you are starting to come back with us we are so thinking of you praying for you talking to you and hoping for you hit that morphine pump once for us will you be a little while until the next beer you are so brave had so much of the other stuff going on that i elected to stay flat it is kind of convenient worry i abandon all the clothes to come down the slide naked although no gurantees on the bottoms once i hit the pool real nice to meet you jules this is the best place that there is to visit away from home these ladies are the best in the world i am always amazed at the gracious welcome that i receive caz cooper and i have been working very hard on our communications on the ground he is so happy to have his mommy with him i have friends with an indoor near by that i can ship to which is very helpful because i can get on and we can walk and circle do laterals etc then the off days we can play our games at home right now i am selfishly allowing my pain levels to dictatae how much that we do day to day oh lori what a beautiful dress and a beautiful ring i have to sympathise gotten my weight all the way down to 132 and then had chemo on thursday within 5 days gained 2 lbs from the awful decadron aranesp aredia and doxil i lose any hair from the doxil bc i had long beautiful hair that disappeared 17 days after my first taxotere when we went to oral meds 8 mths later it grew back all nice and thick we colored it and let her grow 2 yrs later more chemo and there goes the hair i now keep it as short as i can in field mouse brown shot with grey easy to care for and not that bad to look at i miss the hair of my teens but guess that we be that way forever thanks ladies for giving me so many laughs and so much hope better have another mimosa getting too serious here findacure i decided long ago that i would never take the ais been on tamoxifen since november 2008 also with a small stage 1 cancer i was perimenopausal but have now progressed to postmenopausal and my onc said his plan is 2 or 3 years of tamoxifen followed by aromasin well not my plan i do not like the idea of completely cutting off my estrogen supply and told him so his response was that once in menopause you are not making any estrogen anyway and the little bit that you do make goes right to your breasts well i buy that explanation i actually have been considering stopping the tamoxifen for awhile to see if some of my insomnia and libido issues clear up and if they do i may just stay off of hormonal therapy and stick with my lifestyle changes like exercise and healthy eating andrea the normal side effects had on mylan and joint pain lower back and pevic area blurry eyes hot flashes night sweats mood swings fatigue not sure if that is from tami or not i did have chemo but you would think after a year i would have my stima back not and insomina on the watson bone and joint was in my shoulders hands and knees to the point i just want to move it hurt so bad nausea cloudy blurry eyes much worse insomina yeah i think that could get worse and extreme mood swings ditto on this one too since going back on the mylan tamoxifen the cloudy blurry has stopped so has the nausea the insomina is like it was before sleeping like maybe hours a night the only thing that still lingering is the more severe bone and point pain of the hands shoulders and knee the shoulders are still really bad but the hands and knees are way more managable than on the watson tami also noticed that since the switch back and forth now having female issues that never ever had before know if the two are related or not i did four treatments of fec and then four of taxotere last year i find the taxotere that bad at all really i nauseated at all and my hair started to grow back again i did have some pain in my lower back after two of my treatments that was quite painful but only lasted a couple days good luck with your decision any one taking aromasin i did femara for 2 years then had progression to new bone and liver so did chemo for 14 months then stable and did tamoxifen for 6 months then progression now aromasin i have a fine raised rash on my torso chest back and it is itchy i do calamine lotion and claritin and at night benadryl it gets worse 2 hours after taking aromasin at bedtime then is some what better has anyone had a rash with this drug i talked to my pharmacist and he said a skin rash with itching can ocurr as long as it is not hives showed it to my oncology nurse too i have been on aromasin for a month now and it started around day of taking the drug any suggestions thanks dawn i also have bone and joint pain ck55 i agree with stephn i was on femara for 1 yrs with terrible joint pain then was switched to aromasin for 2 months with same issues now been on tamoxifen for 4 months with good results so far my joint pain in my hips is so much better and i believe that i am doing fairly well i have had muscle cramping in my feet and legs at night which my onc said is a se and i take effexor for hot flashes at night but all in all i am tolerating tamoxifen with much less discomfort i started tomoxifen sep 09 i never heard about all the side effects until i read this post i have been having alot of bone pain and am very tired with no desire to do anything i am 48 and still get my periods i have not had any blood work done sence i started tamoxifen one dr told me my pain is wear tear thought that was strange to tell someone the has had bc i see my oncologyst tomorrow and want to make sure i ask all the right questions can any one give me a little info of questions to ask thanks and god bless all look at you i go away for a month and youve doubled the scribblings hey guys hope your all ok way to much letterage for me to catch up on so sorry if i missed anything i managed to get mrsa in my wound which has made the lightening strike into a complete mess but its finailly healing and its looking like i will be starting taxotere next week to much to get my head around but find out thursday been feeling so tired all the time its been to much to get on here and scribble but im back at least for a bit til chemo kicks in again weve had horrendous midges here in south wales weird ones i never seen the likes of before too liking the idea of a meet up and will get in touch carole asap re message big hugs to every body and for anyone new howdy im red nikki xxx on ac i just never knew when my lower stomach would be angry always felt like i had the flu terrible mouth soresand it seemed that i had a lot of sinus issues and a few infections in addition to the uneasy stomach feeling not nausea but just not happy although the taxol caused a lot of bone and muscle pain the other issues seemed to beless than with the acand or better the taxol has caused neuropathy issues that still dealing with ugh i guess each of these drugs comes with their own set of that affect us each a little differently and in a lot of ways the same beachmom lee i have a theory and all it is i have no evidence whatsoever to support my theory i also get a mild no more than to the same time the neulasta bone pain hits or at least attributing that pain to neulasta i guess it could be due to the taxotere which would make this even more interesting maybe someone who is getting tc but not getting neulasta or neupogen could take their temp daily and see if the same temp increase occurs at the same time before they get neutropenic and end up in the hospital of course anyway my neulasta aches and pains hit around day 4 or later that night and continue through day 7 at the same time and with hardly any lag phase i get that fever ok so causing the fever the standard line is that the fever is caused by an infection which may be so mild as to be subclinical i think that explanation is boring and not buying it at this point the reason is that the fever is coming way too early for it to be caused by a infection even with taxotere where the neutrophil nadir hits earlier than with cytoxan or adriamycin our neutrophil counts go down on neulasta anyway until around day 6 or 7 and back up by day 8 or 9 infections have incubation periods so i would think it would take at least a day or two for an infection to get established during that period before we actually started getting sick and displaying a fever if the fever is not caused by an infection then what is causing it well my theory which i will gladly set aside if someone offers another reasonable explanation i think the fever is caused by the same process that causes the neulasta bone pain fever after all is really triggered by prostaglandins that our bodies produce when inflammation occurs bacterial infections cause our inflammatory reaction to the bacteria that results in a fever i wonder if maybe our bone marrow reaction to the neulasta that is resulting in a fever we know neulasta and neupogen cause bone pain the oncos think the bone pain is due to crowding in the periosteum of the bone as newly minted neutrophils all try to get out at the same time pain occurs from stimulation of nerve endings which can be from pressure or it can be from release of chemicals like prostaglandins and leukotrienes think arthritis if you want a mental picture our oncos mine at least plus lots of published research reports say that ibuprofen can help decrease the bone pain from neulasta ibuprofen is a major nsaid that works by inhibiting prostaglandin production thus decreasing pain think make that headache go away or make those menstrual cramps go away if you want a mental picture hmmmm we also have anecdotal evidence from our sisterhood that claritin helps reduce the bone pain from neulasta claritin is an antihistamine h1 blocker so how could that possibly relate well here i go off on a limb again there is nothing i can find to support the argument that claritin works because the bone pain from neulasta is due to an allergy to the neulasta shot if we were allergic to neulasta develop an allergic reaction hives sneezing swelling difficulty breathing etc a lot more likely that claritin is working if it does work by blocking h1 histamine receptors as it usually does and as a result blocking pain besides causing sneezing and sniffling and watery eyes histamine can trigger pain receptors block those receptors and you block the pain the big question is what is causing the release of all those inflammatory chemicals like prostaglandins leukotrienes and histamine after a neulasta shot i on no scientific the movement of those neutrophils through the periosteum is causing release of inflammatory chemicals including those that cause pain and fever maybe some of the neutrophils are dying and releasing their contents maybe becoming activated as they get squeezed out and they dump out their contents they are awfully frail little cells despite their aggressive behavior during battle guess what neutrophils contain zillions of enzymes and prostaglandins and histamine and leukotrienes so maybe the bone pain and fever are coming from the neutrophils themselves or maybe related to the pressures activity in the periosteum in any case i have no money riding on this bet now that retired free to speculate like everybody else otter english rose christmas tree decorating tradition sounds familiar lol i am also a bit larger than when i started treatment and i dont like it walks with my dog and in the last few weeks some gentle yoga classes is how i plan to ease back to more active exercise amy also a baby chick had taxotere and lost almost all hair but had some that fall out it actually grew during treatment and looked really silly so i buzzed it almost to the scalp the other day it seems the hair on my head is really trying to grow now 5 weeks after my last chemo but super fine and has no colour i have done 4 of my 6 weeks radiation now getting red and sore but the thought of only having 2 weeks to go helps got my prescription for tamoxifen the other day and will start that one week after radiation dreading side effects more hot flashes and sleeplessness to be expected fight 4two talk to your dr or nurse if you keep food down and have lost that much weight your body will need protein and nutrients to rebuild the damaged cells after each cycle if you are vegetarian it can sometimes be tricky to get enough protein hope everyone had a nice weekend and are ready for the week ahead one day at a time we will get through this wishi i am a firm believer thatour absence of hormones can make us as emotionally and physically as the hormone fluctuations we go through over the years with pregnancies periods etc refresh my long have you been on arimidex i started out on tamox after chemo hair started growing back did cmf so only lost about half of my on the tamox i could see all these little hair spikes growing and sticking straight up in the air especially at my part line my from the tamox were horrible and unbearable read extreme mood swings and depression coupled with either homicidal or suicidal sure which way to go and since my cypd tests showed i had one inactiveand one partially inactive allee sp even though they said i was an intermediate metabilizer i reluctantlly went on to armidex back in march i was scared shi less to do an ai but find i am fairing much better on that than on the tamox i was a total raving lunatic when i went to see the onc and he was a total sweetheart calmed me down and said lets work on a new plan with something else and lets get you put back together again and comfortable ask me if i adore this man right after starting ai hair started thining again on my nice and black on lips and that fun and that lasted for a couple months and then just stopped now it just seems to be holding the same and i am finding a little less hair on chin and the body adjusting to lack of estrogen less hair on arms and legsbut my skin looks thinner he he need a brazilian cause that hair never grew back after they shaved it for my tram i think finding a new onc will go a long who listens empathized with these se and will work with you in finding a solution to make you more comfortable just wondering is any one have depression with taking tamoxifen and if so what do you take for it i go back to the doctor on thursday just feeling down in the dumps and very tired and crying yo started ac on nov 12 should be done with that the end of this year then 12 weeks of taxol herceptin herceptin continues for a year rads somewhere in there shaved head last week cuz my hair was coming out after i took a shower little cold here in mi gotten a wig yet still considering whether or not i want to just wearing the winter hats do rags and baseball else have a similar schedule mel i am 50 and have idc low grade also er pr and her 2neu the doctors have had 2 opinions have recommended oopherectomy and then the ai the reason being is that i have liver dis and they dont want give me lupron you have to have a good liver and be prepared for side effects from lupron the only reason i know lupron is my husband has prostate ca and on it along with raditiation therapy as surgery was not an option for him he hates the side effects mostly hot flashes night sweats and arthritis flares he already had arthritis so it has made it worse hearing the cause bone pain too so the combo sound great to me none of it does tho does everyone get these sides probably not but check into it i am doing the ooph because at 50 i am so near menopause that i can touch it so why do the shots just my personal view i have heard that some people do ok on the lupron tho so its definitely a personal choice you could always try it then decide peace and prayers thanks omaz hi sheila i remember the dose it was also a replacement for my antidepressant wellbutrin so it was considerably higher my onc prescribes the lowest dose for hot flashes back on wellbutrin now and if i had a seizure disorder i probably safely add effexor but at such a low dose not really worried about it lulubee i gain weight when i was on a higher dose of effexor but i think my body handles drugs a little differently than most on aromasin and causing weight loss for me i rarely feel hungry because of it so eating less maybe effexor would be ok since a low dose you could try it for a month or two and see i disagree that the level of have anything to do with rather or not they are working or not our bodies are unique and and handle what is put in them differently i am not on tamoxifen but have been on femara letrozole since feb 11 2010 with no is it working yes as far as i can tell still riding ned and ibc er pr so that says a lot also on a c i had very little hair left lost sense of taste and appetite but it got to form a lump with margins for surgeon taxol caused complete utter exhaustion compared to what many deal with i had it easy odds for ibc are not good at best so i can only believe based on personal experience that one does not have to have nasty to mean that they are working hi all i had lymph nodes removed on my right side and was told tonever use that arm for blood pressure readings or blood draws i did ask what about if my left arm is not possible i was told that you can get blood pressure and drawstaken on your legs if both arms are at risk of lymphodema or for any other reason you use them for those purposes i have found you need to be diligent about instructing techs not to use your arm for example when i was hospitalized in march and woken up in the middle of the night the technician started putting the blood pressure cuff on my right arm even tho i was wearing the brightly colored bracelet that said no blood pressure blood draws from this arm good thing i so drugged out that i notice it and stopped her i am 12 days past my last chemo it until this thursday morning that i woke up with some energy and feeling better than previously i still have the nose bleeds from the avastin that ended 3 weeks ago neuropathy in both feet and toes from the taxol tongue without taste buds and very sensitive to the touch and cracked lips my nails still growing in blackish and my skin still shows red broken capillaries here and there but on the plus side not feeling like an old bag of bones my hair is coming back mostly white all over eyebrows arms head and private parts they were brown before i think going to change i even see white eyelashes coming in and white nose hairs yea hopefully will stop the constant dripping my oncologist gave me intravenous feron iron last tuesday and i am hoping that will improve the anemia my wbc was going back up too still low rbc i have to go back tuesday for more iron and blood level checks and she gave me a script for another mugga test and some fancy named ekg to check my heart i also go to my radiology consultation on june 25th to begin that journey probably in early july got appointments for the dermatologist gynecologist primary doctor and dentist all coming up in the next two weeks going to check out everything so recovery has begun finally from the chemo but like the continued infusions of iron got to give your body some help so i restarted my daily vitamins and just started the 81mg baby aspirin per day i might have to stop them again for the upciming radiation but i figure try to give my body some supplements until then been back to work for two weeks now and was totally out of commission last weekend exhausted but okay this morning and hoping that tomorrow and the next and the next are equally positive by the way really sick of wearing coleen my wig i now only wear her to work and she gets yanked off in the car going home we went out to dinner last night and i went capless and wigless for the first time with a covering of very short and fine hair at least not bald anymore as soon as it grows enough to comb the wig is getting ditched hugs to everyone not posting as much just because of full time work and grandson and life in general but reading your posts every day pat i will be starting tamoxifen soon and i am really scared these almost seem unbearable has anyone had a good experience on tamoxifen i realize it be great but the joint pain and weight gain are not something i am looking forward to i already need to lose weight and i have arthritis in my knees and spine as it is thanks to all of you though for posting your at least i have an idea what i am in for allison arya try not to worry about chemo you know how you are going to react nobody gets all listed se i mentally prepared myself for all of them i had dose dense a c and taxol with very few se apart from loosing hair bonus no shaving and free brasilian without the pain of waxing i also negotiated with my onc cutting down on the amount of steroids after my 1st round i was worried about gaining weight from them it was possible in my case as i did not have any nausea or allergic reaction i was just very weak on day 3 and 4 while on ac and although my apetite decreased i had some weird cravings almost like during pregnancy my taste buds changed and so did my sensitivity to variety of different scents so my house became almost fragrance free for a couple of months i did make sure to drink about cups of water every day and walk for at least 45 min every day including the days when i had zero energy and my hubby had to hold my arm and walk me around the block that would be on days 3 4 taxol totally different story much easier to handle i did travel a bit during chemo we tried to make weekend trips on my good weekends i enjoyed staying at the hotels shopping a bit it worked better then any antidepressant by taking me away from the cancer environment so please be scared if your dr recommends chemo time goes by so fast hair comes back quickly soon it will be all behind you i personally think that treatment is not the worst thing we have to handle it is moving beyond bc what seems to be the challenge for me anne i rinse whether my mouth itbothers me or not i brush twice a day and rinse about times a day and i irrigate my sinuses once a day and am really doing well in mouth and nose i am on a thursday schedule next on but we are close as for the weight gain i was a totally diabetic before cancer and have been really trying to watch my diet and control my sugar which is doing great so i gained any weight except for the water weight from the taxotere my hands and legs are swollen and it usually goes away right before the next chemo i too like the way the neulasta shot makes me feel but it is keeping my wbc count in the safe range so i will tolerate it two more times as for feeling bad after chemo i am ok the day of then start to feel crappy on friday and usually feel totally out of ituntil about tuesday then just general blah for about another week i really admire the women who can work i just as a nurse my job is to demanding and physical and i have what it takes right now i have numerous medical issues and seem to always be going to gainesville to a doctor or lab or something and each trip is at least 70 miles round trip which due to traffice takes about an hour or slightly less each way i am starting to feel good so i usually have about a week before the next chemo when all i have to deal wit is fatigue and i just take it easy one other thing i use vaseline on my hands and feet and they are doing well too i am gonna switch to aquafor on the recommendation of a sister of mine who says it has other stuff in it that will help hold the moisture in hang in there anne we will make it sheryl lisa i am with you about the hair mine was so think and started coming out in clumps it was falling everywhere and i had to keep vacuuming and sweeping i cried all day friday because i knew this was coming but today when my friend buzzed it i knew it was the right time and i am ok with it i look like gi jane the other thing about my hair was that my scalp actually hurt so my friend said she was impressed by how strong i am i do not feel strong at all i do not feel brave like all of us i am doing what i have to do to win this fight i have some fleece caps and scarves i do have a wig which i will wear maybe on christmas or other rare occasions atlbrave i also had a huge headache after my first ac they slowed down the cytoxin drip of the second infusion and the headache was not as bad i do have a mild sinus like headache every day ibuprofen and advil do not work do any of you know what a hot flash feels like i have heard some people sweat i just feel hot like i have been working out i know if it is a hot flash or just a reaction to chemo my head feels wired and so do my eyes i wait to feel good again lisa my westie has been by my side every day since this all began he knows something is going on with me and is very protective dogs are special hello triple congrats to connie looks like jayne gilly and are all done the last week my last treatment is the 26th hooray for us and all for the stuff to be done i hope everyone is healing up for all the falls and shingles jayne i have thrush again i think we are the only ones on taxotere by itself i have had thrush 3 times following every treatment also had a weird rash that was a fungus too i used the mouth wash more before the last treatment and ate yogurt and the thrush was not as bad this time we sound like we are in great spirits and looking forward to the future good for all of and strenght dianne hi jenrio great questions i can answer some now but am waiting on some info myself for some of the others aka detailed second round pathology report the new tumor is left lobe last time it was mostly the right lobe only one tiny met on the left this could be in the same spot but the present met is too big to know exactly where it originated five years ago i had a surgeon signed on to do rfa if i did not have complete resolution or if cancer regrew from the same site by the time i saw him i was down to one met so i was able to provide a convincing story re meeting oligmet status however chemo and femara finished that met off also followed the controversy quite closely since and will let the outcomes of this chemo steer me a bit turn to local liver interventions if still very chemo responsive aka met is dramatically reduced in size allowing rfa or cyberknife approaches to get excellent margins if there are no micromets in the liver hiding out and if the will consent to post treatment of some kind really like to do direct liver chemo maybe i can argue for that given weird tumor biology if not a short course of systemic chemo would be next choice see i do liver surgery its quite safe now days but it would mean i might have to be off treatment when suddenly need it i also have no wish to be miserable even for a moment more than i have to be also not sure how er pr positive i am at this point that will also influence my thinking if they are the same as they were first time around very er and moderate pr have more confidence in the potential stability that a hormonal will bring again if weaker join the affinitor camp i need to read the report which currently waiting on afraid my taxol allergy is likely to the carrier the part that delivers taxol to the cell rather than the taxol itself its the most common allergic reaction and why taxol is always given with antihistamine and steroid premedication still very hopeful my reaction to gemzar is more extreme so maybe thats a good sign hoping though that i can keep the side effects from disabling the value of the drug gemzar is synergistic with taxol that means in combo taxol works even better with a gemzar chaser and chemo is good for raging cancer growth like i have so there is reason to be optimistic my tumor was discovered by staging rather than symptoms so liver enzymes were normal till i had done a couple of chemo rounds we have been testing ca for my whole remission and the levels ranged from they never got higher than that the last test was the same week my tumor was discovered normal is below 31 i guess we be testing for it anymore so i will post weird path results in more detail once this is available and i have a chance to do a bit of research thanks again for your comments and questions hope the answers are helpful hi not motheye and i see this thread when i decided to decline tamoxifen or an ai in early 2012 but i am now 2 and a half years past the lx and rads had my last check in july i am cancer free and enjoying life even more than before i will deal with a recurrence if and when it only then in the meantime i look forward to my and imaging as due diligence and as ways of being assured that everything is fine i welcome them as not as dreaded ominous times that will reveal a problem in reaching my decision to pass on hormonal treatment my reasoning was similar to 50 reduction of a low recurrence risk just make the risks worth it and i was not thinking about the risk of transient side effects but of the large and even comorbidities that tamoxifen and can and do create like stroke deep vein thrombosis and pe glaucoma osteoporosis etc my tumor was stage 1 grade 1 with clean margins no nodal involvement and a low oncotype score so at 71 years of age i liked the odds and when the mo who ordered the oncotype test called with the results she said she agreed that my decision to pass on hormonal therapy made a lot of sense for my case on the subject of by the way she said at the outset of our one and only meeting that her role is to give her best advice not to dictate a treatment plan or to bamboozle a patient into doing something out of fear or intimidation she did not tell me that i will take the drug in fact when she and i were discussing hormonal therapy i asked her why prescribe a drug like tamox so freely even though it causes weight gain in women who should be controlling their weight in order to lower their risk of a recurrence or a new cancer she was at a total loss for words and had no answer to that logical question except to say that it raised an important dilemma it sounds as if your idea about seeing the for another opinion would be a good idea given your feelings about the drug and also given the approach of the first mo you saw this is a hard decision to make and one that be made lightly it is also a highly personal decision based on your stats on your comfort level with those stats and on your expectations i wish you luck as you grapple with this question and peace of mind once you decide either way trudi debbie i was diagnosed with stage iii cardiomyopathy 3 months after finishing ac and starting herceptin that was in april 2006 thanks to a beta blocker ace inhibitor diaretics and nitro i live a very different life than i did before bc diagnosis i have learned to respect my limitations glory in my good days and not fret too much when i have a bad time i watch my stress eat right exercise and do biofeedback etc echos are routinely done every 3 months or more often if there is a need my doctor is the head of scripps heart failure clinic so i feel really confident that i have excellent care of this part of the journey i am also a patient ambassador for genentech makers of herceptin and found a sizeable number of the 26 ambassadors had some heart issues the great news however is that these bc sisters are continuing to live good lives despite initial dx of stage iii iv or years very best wishes for healthy and happy days nancy hi everyone thought check in now that finished my fourth and final ac tx 12 weekly taxol is next the fatigue this round has been ridiculous i seem to stay awake for long i was wondering if anyone else has experienced phlebitis i have a port and each location that been stuck in my hand for my iv has resulted in a very sore area upstream in my veins even some bruising been using a heating pad several times daily as my nurse recommended but it helped much my nurse is getting concerned that i may run out of good veins can only use right side because of lymph node removal on left as juicy as they are if i am facing 12 more needle sticks for taxol really want to avoid a port and hoping that the issue was caused by the harshness of the adrimycin and the taxol affect my veins as much anyone have the same issue hope everyone has a restful weekend 65 70 er pr currently having chemo fecx 4 and taxoterex 4 lumpectomy end of july and rads in september i will say no to tamoxifen as something inside me just says it is wrong wrong to play around with hormones and not having the quality of life you deserve because of aswell as the cancer bloodclot and osteporosis risks my doctors have not suggested ovary removal i would very much like to have children my periods have been normal since i started chemo in the end of january still waiting for this months though but then again we are all different every cancer case is just that i personally consider tamoxifen like an aspirin you take it to suppress something in this case something more serious than a headache of course get me wrong but not look for the source of your troubles in my case and not saying applicable to everyone as many of us had a very healthy life style prior to bc certain i will be fine without suppressing my organs or hormones just a questionable life style filled with supressed feelings stress a lot of red meat not enough organic vegetables and fruit not respecting the fatigue tobacco coffee alcohol working nights etc etc i am currently trying to make my doctors test me for recurrence risk but quite positive it change my way of thinking anyhow best c so far so good today today is day 3 of my 1st treatment with taxol slept good last night fingers felta little tingly this morning so not sure if that is neuropathy or not did take b6 and l glutamine which is suppose to help with that will see how the rest of the day goes cindy good evening to everybody hopefully in answer to everyone the 7 taxotere was my last one supposed to start on herceptin and perjeta only this thursday i am so in hopes the h p without the taxotere will be easier this last taxotere was a killer no joke had nausea today almost 3 weeks out and hip and bone pain that i finally broke down and took zofran and a percocet felt better in a hour or 2 help but think what happens when i need another chemo to go with the h p what will it be love to all and thanks for all of the continued support i take tamoxifen and it lists hair loss as a se if you take biotin supplement it is supposed to keep that from happening approx daily also my mo tested my blood and liver when i went for my check so i assume that is what he is checking for these are powerful drugs we are taking and not without some toxic impact to our bodies make sure you get those regular blood tests to make sure you getting too much toxicity as i said i am only taking of the dose recommended by my doctor and still getting but they are getting better when they subside i will try and up the dose to the recommended one this way my body can transition properly i always play by the same rules as the doctors hehe thanks i have hair it started to grow back during taxol in feb so i have a good head of hear i thought it might be that to itchy because the hair was growing in but since i already have hair i was unsure i do see my doctor on fri so i will ask him all of a sudden i have a bunch of new symptoms that i had before or that have just gotten worse i went for my weekly herceptin today i had my first taxotere carboplatene herceptin a week ago my onc give me a neulasta shot last week because he likes to wait to see if there is a problem first but today my wbc was only so i got the shot my mouth sores were so bad today it is hard to swallow anything and i also have a pimply rash all over my body which the doc says is probably a reaction to the steroids i left the office with a prescription for leviquin an antiviral med and a topical cream for the rash definitely going to need a bigger medicine cabinet also the nurse was unable to draw blood from my port today apparently they sometimes get clogged and she had to put something in that cleaned it out but took an hour and a half to do so in the meantime they stuck an iv in my hand for the herceptin julieh the onc said that people who get a lot of cold sores tend to have more problems with mouth sores when getting chemo so hopefully the antiviral will help i also have the magic mouthwash and biotene rinse i stand gargling with salt water either thanks for the suggestion of the biotene gel i know overnight is when my mouth really gets dried out aimeemac your husband is a darling science girl sorry about the pain and low wbc i hope you got a good nap today utmom 2014 so sorry you had to spend all that time in the hospital cblue 17 impacted bowels sounds really unpleasant sure they told you to start taking something like miralax and a stool softener before the next tx i know that even though i did that i go until the 4th day and i felt like i would explode hi zia hope feeling better now i had docetaxal last year 6 rounds with herceptin and carboplatin i found lucozade really good helped with nausea too also elderflower presse is nice too if struggling with nausea ask your onc about emend anti sickness i had it after my second round and i never felt any sickness after that best wishes emma i will start my 8th cycle of abraxane and it has me worn out i am three weeks on and one week off it is making me lose the feeling in my hands and feet i havetwisted my ankle twice in the last two months how many cycles can a body tolerate my scans in february showed a 30 reduction in liver met but it did nothing for the bones the doc put me on aromasin to help the bones also is there anything to get rid of this metal taste in my mouth i still eat but nothing tastes good you would think with beingoverweight i would take this time to diet i am just feeling so down i even want to get out of bed today i guess i am just feeling sorry for myself log in to post a reply ckptry that really sucks i really think that taking tamoxifen and herceptin concurrently is a lot for your sytem how many more herceptin txs do you have perhaps waiting until you are done with herceptin would be good most of us on this thread seemed to have been the types of people not wanting to ever take meds at all i fought about starting synthroid in any case all of the sudden we are being made the equivalent of a long island iced tea of prescriptions i think any of the reactions any of you us are having are odd at all and i do think they are 100 attributable perhaps not to 1 but the number of meds we are on i hope you can resume perhaps after herceptin oh carolyn i sure hope better times are coming i have been on tamoxifen about a month and my biggest problems are the sweating and sleep issues some nausea lack of sleep and i am achey i just talk about these things much b c i know if it is left over from chemo if it is age or what i hate to complain but i have to be honest with you all also the rash on my butt lower back and inside of 1 arm is very very weird and i will be off to the derma about that i know about you all but i am so tired of going to doctors i mean they are all nice and pleasant so it is not about the doctors themselves but i am just tired of having to go oh well enough whining rachel your hair looks great it is growing in pretty well i really feel so bad for you about the sleep issues it really sucks for you because you are back to work i could not work like this between all the issues with sleep and feeling sick achey tired and hot i have this wound in all of disgusting glory packing it twice daily that wound area hurts sometimes really bad in the night also and wakes me up as for you it seems as if your job might be demanding from some of what you have said and doing that on a lack of sleep and being a mother and wife is an awful lot of hats to wear when you are running on fumes of sleep i sure hope they are able to help you out in some way sleep if when any of you have taken a sleep aid or an med to help you sleep do you find when you wake your sleep seems to have been somewhat artificial like you get real sleep but rather sleep just wondering good morning sisters rekoz i really wished you felt better i have had this fever and cough for 4 days and this is suppose to be ny good week i can only stay up long enough to get water or potty i have been home alone as husband is out of town til tomorrow ugg it ok though i have no responsibilities that way he will come home to no food in the house and a dirty kitty litter poor guy as far as my roll on gh i ran a bed and breakfast for doctor dante i was on the show right before luke and laura heyday most of my acting success has been in comedy though i also was on marcus wellby do you remember him i was a child abuse case that had arrested development type casting my daughter is a producer now and is in cinema she keeps trying to get me to go back to acting i told her if they needed any bald middle aged heavy set women just let me know she has not gotten back to me on that happy birthday lisa your an aries that explains alot i am too my bday is the 30th of march i do not have one more to do by the way i have 2 more i am most concerned about the new blood clot in my leg and the fact that i can only stand for about 15 min but like you said i am sure that there are people that have had it worse than me but it really does not help when your suffering as i am sure you know when i get over the fever and cough which i seem to have developed a little incontinence with oh boy i am sure my strength and attitude will improve on chemo brain i was ask to be in a study for chemo brain at ucla they test you right after chemo then in six month and then a year i have not decided if i want to do it or not i hate tests and if i have lost cognitive values who the heck wants to know ignorance is bliss how come hardly anyone writes a bio jaimieh iam very glad that they are monitoring your kidneys carbo is a heavy metal it has a hard time leaving the body and seems to be especially hard on kidney i am having problems with my liver which is from the taxotere please let us know how they are dealing with it my guess is that they will back down a little on the amount they are giving you and give your system a chance to flush pound the water please did they put you on additional steroids take care of your self cupcake thank you for your kindness not good news about the sun as i have a convertible a pool and spend a lot of time at the beach i am seeing a lot of big hats long sleeves and spf 1000 thank you all for your thoughts and prayer for our family member loss i pray that they find a cure everyday been taking tamoxifen for a little over 3 weeks now previous to starting tamoxifen i did 5 months of ovarian suppression with lupron as a way to try to protect my ovaries during chemo still like to have kids someday compared to the side effects of the lupron tamoxifen has been a breeze i had night sweats hot flashes hourly say major vaginal dryness and dry skin while on lupron it was a difficult experience to go through especially while dealing with the chemo the only upside was that i felt more emotionally without all that estrogen running through my body it just improved my mental functioning and i was able to think more clearly with tamoxifen only had one side effect which is some bloating around my stomach not terribly bad and noticed that drinking dandelion tea seems to help resolve it but the kind of bloat i used to get from pms other than that no other issues to report as of yet as with the lupron i feel an improvement in my emotional health since starting tamoxifen i realize how much my hormones had impacted my emotions all these years but now i can see the difference on tamoxifen not had any of the problems with joint stiffness hot flashes or vaginal dryness that i had with lupron but i suppose these drugs work in different ways one shutting down the hormonal system and one just blocking the estrogen and i guess that makes the difference shockingly i got my period two weeks after starting tamoxifen only three months out from my last chemo and i thought it would be a longer chemopause than that and it was what i would describe as my normal period hoping that if i had many of the side effects of the tamoxifen yet i may be able to avoid them i had read that most people get the most significant side effects early on and if you experience them then you probably later on i hope true i wanted to share my experience here because i was very scared and sad about starting tamoxifen i expected the worst but been none of that when i was first diagnosed i was overcome with fear about every step of the journey surgery chemo radiation hormonal therapy what i have found is that all of it was easier than i expected at least the physical part of it it was still hard and chemo was really difficult but it as horrible as i had anticipated in my mind what learned is that maybe you should prepare for the worst but not expect it because it may never come to pass and if it does come to pass you can deal with it then my nails also are a mess my big toenails started going bad in october about 6 weeks after i started adriamycin then the taxol took over the big toe nails are starting to improve at the bases but the middle to end is quite thick and misshapen i am having trouble cutting them so i am thinking it might be time to break down and go see a podiatrist my fingernails have all lifted and they are so brittle that they break very easily i have never been a vain person but i do notice people looking at them with odd expressions before they started coming apart from the nail bed they became discolored and i looked like i had tobacco stains on all my fingers kind of a funny hair story i met a woman the other day at a rowing class i was wearing my ball cap and said something about my hair coming back in she asked what it was from and i told her chemo she said oh i saw a woman the other day who was totally bald you could see her entire scalp i said how i was just a few months ago and she said no i mean totally bald i said what i mean my husband used to comment on how shiny my head was she just stared at me i found it humorous i think this week may be the week that i finally ditch the wig at work have a great week everyone hello i am new to this forum and glad i found you i met with my onc yesterday to get cat bone scan results the bone mets in my spine ribs legs are stable but a first time very very small spot on my liver showed up so the the gemzar avastin that i have been on is not doing the trick and my doc wants to try a different chemo hormone blocking drugs kept things stable for almost 5 years before we switched to chemo in jan my onc discussed 3 different drugs with us and their side effects that he would try next they are doxil xoleda or abraxane he said they all have their pros and cons and either one of these could do the trick every body reacts and responds differently he said to go home and think and research these drugs and get back to him today about which drug i would like to start he did not push one drug over the other and we have researched all three last night and like choosing from a bad menu at a bad resturant sooo any advice and past experience with these drugs would be helpful would be helpful the gemzar avastin combo made me nauseated tired for about 5 or 6 days then i would bounce back on my week off got used to that routine and now need to choose another the xoleda pill form is appealing 2 weeks on one week off keeping my hair and all but i worry about being nauseated for 2 whole weeks and the hand foot thing just trying to make an informed decision and would greatly appreciate ant info thanks to all log in to post a reply hello ladies i am so pleased to have found this thread i will be starting chemo on june 22nd and it was always in my head that i would have to force myself to eat well while going through the process my appetite is mostly absent so it was going to be tricky however i will now ask my onco what he thinks about the fasting idea i hope he approves as i think i would find it easier to not eat than eat and if it benefits me along the way what a bonus i have been on zometa 3 weekly since november and have had some pretty horrific experiences with nausea and vomiting with that so im thinking i am particularly vulnerable to suffering that nasty so anything that can minimise it im all for it its very interesting to hear how you are all getting along with it thank you so much for sharing your experiences my plan is to do 6 x fec with a ct scan half way through to check it is working if not i expect there will be a change to the cocktail i just know that these things would be so alarming to me if i had not had the benefit of reading all your experiences in all things chemo thank you to everyone who contributes as the help you give is priceless good luck ladies sue x hi michelle i was in this in boston now nearly six years past diagnosis and doing well i was 58 at diagnosis my profile is similar to yours except er and so took letrozole for five years i stopped taking that drug in january i had a lumpectomy with clear margins 12 weeks of taxol herceptin then finishing out the year of herceptin followed by 33 radiation treatments i was one of the few people who experienced permanent peripheral neuropathy from the taxol i have a strong feeling that if chosen the other option available to me tch the could have been much worse the treatment overall was easy to tolerate i worked all the way through taking only treatment days off and that was just because i was usually so tired fatigued that come home and take a nap these are clearly hard decisions and if you know nothing about these issues when you get this diagnosis it can feel truly overwhelming whatever you decide best of luck ann i had to have everything removed abdominally tah bso 4 years ago due to large ovarian rupture not by choice believe me if i kept my ovaries i would have my ses from tamoxifen were very mild hot compared to the ses i had due to the immediate surgical menopause the first year was very rough especially with the hot flashes night sweats and fatigue having major abdominal surgery at the same time help over time things did level off but now i have a lot of achiness and early osteopenia gyn said estrogen lubricates the joints and is a natural so with estrogen depletion often comes me so now he wants me to try glucosamine take hrt due to the bc risk so hope this helps anne hi i was 47 and when diagnosed 07 after my first chemo treatment i stopped having my period and it has not returned since april 2007 i started taking tamoxifen 16 months ago and say that had any real problems with it i seem to lose any weight and my skin is dryer than before heard some people do have of issues so far so good for me does anyone know if it is ok to combine tamoxifen and ativan i have post traumatic stress that dealing with hi tina my husband hates hospitals and even though he has gone with me each time i usually send him off to do shopping or something as its sometimes easier on your own re cold cap i took paracetamol each time and the nurses have given me hot drinks and a heat pad if you can get through the first ten minutes or so you can do it i nearly gave up in cycle 4 as it easy but i got through it and regret it my hair has thinned a lot especially just after the second cycle but it means a lot to me to have kept my hair even though it is very thin the new roses said if i grant cold capped i have any hair at all my rads start 5 weeks after my chemo finishes and i am planning to go on holiday two weeks after having missed two planned holidays due to chemo i really need a break our holiday insurance paid up on both and were very helpful the fec part of chemo if what you are having is pumped in through a syringe by the nurses and the t part is a drip take all the meds they give you and if the sickness and nausea are bad ask for emend which is a more expensive but very effective anti sickness drug i was never actually sick as i took that from the start good luck claire xx i am currently on my 8th cycle of abraxane 3 weeks on one week off it is still working the only se is neuropathy and some fatigue no premeds required had a severe allergic reaction to taxol in 2007 all my best krystyna bandanagirl it sounds like you are about a month ahead of me i get my last ac on and then start 4 taxol how did you manage the ac i do well from the day of until about 7 days later nausea is awful i force myself to eat something about day i am tired but feel better when i am busy i take claritin for a few days and the neulasta shot been too bad hurts like a son of gun when i get sick though you mentioned you feel o k by day 4 do you get an upset stomach or just achy and tired did you have any reaction to the tx what med changes did you make between the different treatments sorry so many quetions but i am really hoping it is better than the ac not sure i can handle 5 more like this i like the new name seems like it befits all of us glad things are going o k enjoy the good days chris i love coming here and being able to catch up on the daily news and with great commentary too loved the love thy neighbor way too much shit being pulled by our greedy politicians seeing my onc tomorrow to get scan results and find out what my next chemo is going to be he pulled me off taxol last week when he found out my neuropathy was getting worse i am on taxol now just finshed 7 of 12 treatments last week the neuropathy pains in my hands and feet really starting showing up more but what has become really frustrating is the pain in my back and legs and the nerve pain that was described by kat of touch me at timeswhen walking i feel like my legs want to give out my sister used to come over and give me back massages for pain relief and relaxation but now i stand to be touched i too am on avastin placebo and on the weeks i have the avastin placebo i terrible catus butt intensified pain in my insisions and bloody sinuses i guess what i find frustrating is that my mind feels clearer and i do i feelbetter than when i was on ac with the exception of the terrible taxol pain so am i really feeling better or dealing with different pain i just finished radiation on 13 and been on tamoxifen for a few weeks i have had lightheadness for a couple of weeks i have tried staying hydrating while it is better it is still continuing i seem to get short of breath easier than i use to as well i am not an over weight person either oncologist denies that this is the tamoxifen and told me to go see my general doctor they did some blood work and waiting on results has anyone had these same issues has anyone heard of recurrence so soon after treatment i had have received similarcombo of poison and then some i received 4 cycles of fec three weeks apart combined with a study drug followed by bilat mast then 2 cycles of taxotere three weeks apart but due to bone pain had to switch to 6 weekly cycles of taxol then 28 rounds of radiation it was a very long 2007 but imade it let me know if can help in anyway i was on taxol for 12 weeks and herceptin i gradually lost my half of my eyelashes during the last 6 weeks and then lost the majority of my eyelashes 6 weeks post treatment i kept half of my eyebrows eyebrows are not difficult to recreate with pencil but eyelashes are a different story btw i am only just sprouting hair on my head 6 weeks post taxol beverly i am so sorry you got bad news but i am glad that you were able to vent some of the same things you said are the same things that drive me crazy i have had some recent progression and will have to go back on taxol and lose my hair again so my brother already shaved his head again and my husband says he will shave his as well i told them if they really wanted to be supportive they would shave off their eyebrows and pluck all their eyelashes as well yeah right like that will happen i too hate the comment you beat it before you can beat it again good luck to you and feel free to vent whenever needed the ladies here are great and i know what i would do without all of them i am having dose dense ac every 2 weeks then taxol every 2 weeks and i get the neulasta shot the first time i had very minor aches from it the second time i had jabs of pain in my legs and hips the third time i had almost no leg or bone pain from it go figure it does definitely help your wbc counts mine have remained well within the normal range even 7 days after chemo which is the lowest point i think it seriously lowers your risk of infection including colds and flu and such therefore rather have the minor aches that come with the neulasta shot than a full blown cold or case of the flu and have those aches i have taken tylenol once or twice for the neulasta pain but usually i take anything also very active or was before all this i love to run and was very healthy going into chemo not happy about having another drug in my cocktail but having had a friend who had a bad time with chemo and infections willing to do it dear jdubious hello been on femara for 8 months i was gaining so much weight on aromasin so my doctor put me on femara i like it my pain is awful i sleep all the time and the hot flashes are awful so my family doctor put me on effexor to help with the hot flashes and mood swings having cancer has just messed me up gained weight and yuk my doctor also put me on sulindac for the joint pain good luck so i saw my surgeon today all remember that not liking him too much anymore so he first wants to know where i did my rads and i told him hosp at arlington hosp and he wanted to know why i told him when i tried to make my consultation appointments arl hosp never returned my call so that was that then he wanted to know why i done the ct scan he ordered in march i told him i did the ct scan at you could tell he like that answer so i have to ask to have my report sent over to him at arl so he can check on the spot on my lung that he forgot about when i saw him in march till i reminded him of course he was almost giddy at the thought that the spot might be something he could remove as if so i asked him for how long will i be coming in to check with him he said for 5 years after dx see me annually for a mammogram uh no i do mammos i told him they find anything he said a mri finds too many false positives and that be doing unnecessary biopsies on me as a result again as if so we compromised do a mammo every other year and an mri in the intervening years starting me with a mammo in oct of course what he know is that the crew is ordering an mri on me in nov so still getting what i want and the other thing he know is that if he ever finds anything be getting another not ever cutting in to me again as if he also asked about my sleeve and i told him oh yeah he helped me qualify for a cancer parting have le he said get this you have le i only took out half of your lymph nodes i held up my index finger and told him that it only takes one lymph node removed to put a patient at risk for le he started to object and i held up my finger again and told him firmly that it only takes one dolt yes i think the bitch from hell that will hound him for the next four years so kathyl thanks for the insight on the brca testing still on the fence about it and need to talk it over with my dh if i can ever get him to sit still for 5 just left on another biz trip i hear what saying about the ovarian cancer risk carol cuz right brca positive folks are at risk through the roof but my gyn is going to be watching me closely for uterine cancer a tamox se and since the ovaries are nearby really kinda wrapped about the insurance issue and then how this information will affect my girls if positive like kathyl said my girls should get screening earlier anyway just cuz had bc will the brca results change anything i think so is it better just to stick your head in the sand sometimes chj my red flags are my age i was under 50 when i was the fact that of jewish descent through my side and the fact that several people in my family have had various skin cancers the other items that she cited as flags are multiple bc or ovarian cancer in one family multiple dx of cancer in one person cancer running through maternal side grandma mother daughter or instances of male bc in your family with your history i can see why talking to you about this be curious to hear how you come to your decision on testing oh and on the ovary removal question i actually asked my onc if he thought it would be a good idea for me since my cancer is er pr he said that removing the ovaries would stop hormone production for a while but end it permanently apparently some of the fat stores in our body would begin to manufacture hormones since i was suggesting the surgery to avoid taking tamoxifen it was clear to me that it would not get me out of it so i still have my ovaries although probably all shriveled up but another story hey patty good to hear from you sorry going all big brother on you at work and you now have to sneak off to chat with us almost like having an affair it i suspect i would have the plumbing pulled if i were brca too who knows maybe the fact that tired of surgery is part of the reason not jumping on this tamox made me dizzy i just have constant hot flashes although i will say the black cohosh does seem to be helping not gone but seem to be fewer i also get leg cramps and want to cry all the damn time fortunately it seem to be causing me to gain weight which is what happened to my neighbor that would put me over the top i still have 2 lbs to lose from my dx weight and then back to the old me not sure kathy that my bs detector is any better never had much patience for that i do find that more sympathetic to other people with health issues giving a little wider berth to them these days allowing them to shuffle ahead of me instead of bulldozing right through them for example funny just this morning my dh was telling me that his boss wife was just with bc now you have to understand this woman has never ever noticed me whenever i speak to her she looks past me and then will realize that talking to her and gets the most impatient annoyed look on her face everyone at my firm talks about how rude and cold she is so you can imagine my surprise when i immediately said call her and see how things are going he really pressured me not to eventually he gave in and said if i want to go ahead but he want to hear me complain about how needy she is down the road i know the kind of woman that will shine in the attention and not really need me for the sympathy at all have to figure out what i want to do joan that dog is too cute with carol it would be hard to get mad at her for peeing on the rug glad everyone made it home okay julie yuck on the lyme disease heard catching it early is key so tell your dh not to delay getting in to the doc tinalee you make me lol so a cycling junkie huh well its pig in shit time for you then and two sons with a plan you must be happy to hear them looking ahead and figuring things out it sounds like it be better timing for you as you prepare for the next chapter in your life i despise moving too and you worry the right dog will come along i think going to go watch the last episode of kitchen before my girls get off work today maybe a quick trip to the liquor store first though out of gin and those g ts are hitting the spot these days my sister drank almost the whole bottle of gin i bought 10 days ago onward d1 thanks for your reply i have know this particular md for about 12 yrs as i am a nurse practitioner and he mentioned 6 treatments with tc 3 weeks apart i have bargained for 5 instead i finished the second last thursday and had more nausea the first was a breeze i am stageiia one node involved mass was 12mm herneg estrogenpositive i opted out of the adriamycin secondary to the cardio effects although the md mentioned 4 dd ac and then 4 tc which i thought was overkill i also had 4 cycles of taxotere and cytoxan i weathered it pretty well i kept up on my nausea meds and never got sick i worked out throughout my entire chemo i had chemo on friday and then resumed my workouts on tuesday a positive with this regimen is that taxotere is not hard on your heart like ac there is possible neuropathy effects though i found out after that it is good to take through your treatment get the powder kind at the health food store i am taking it now but wished i would have started sooner i have slight numbness in three of my fingertips on my right hand i finished the end of sept 06 and i also have a full head of curly hair i get a lot of compliments on my haircut ha good luck to you like people have said so many times on this site it is doable and it will be behind you before you know it mimi ok so i lied so sorry to have gotten you all going wish it were april 1 so i could say april fools i could have sworn that my nutrition friend told me chick peas were high but i just asked and she thought i was nuts so i have no idea what i was thinking sorry but thanks for clearing me up on that now i can eat more hummus i gave up on using an actual index too much work tried a low glycemic diet using an index and tried atkins in the past neither did anything at all for me this time my doc gave me the very simple rules of vegetable or fruit and protein and had success in so many ways i think because the focus became fiber through vegetables and fruit rather than focusing on protein lilah my high yeast was just a lot of yeast infections every surgery brought antibiotics which lead to yeast infections galore i had never had one before this when i asked my gyn about it she explained to me that because tamoxifen blocks estrogen it decreases the thickness of the vaginal lining which makes me more susceptible to yeast infections and other issues so i started the low glycemic for the yeast and for fatigue i also started a daily dose of vitamin e a and collagen to build the vaginal wall back up so far it seems to be working i started to get an infection yesterday but i drank tons of water and had cranberry pills every two hours and all better in my head but hey whatever works julie rev up as always melrose had great advise i have a port i am calamity jane and was certain things would go wrong with port or pic line both of which my mo wanted i insisted we use my veins which had been good in the past for the blood draws between infusions i had them use the smaller veins in my hand and always asked them to use a pediatric butterfly to draw the blood which was easier for them to use and hurt as much we had to insist that the head nurse do my iv insertions she is great and really experienced so it has gone fine my last ct is this friday so i am hoping my vein is good again i also used the biotene to help prevent mouth sores twice or three times daily also i had ice chips all through the taxotere infusion and drank all through the cytoxan i did ice my fingers and toes from 15 minutes before to 15 minutes after the taxotere and so far no nail changes also used sally hansen hard as nails and used dark polish for infusion days on top of it hydrate hydrate the day before and day of and at least two days after as the cytoxan can be hard on the bladder i had no diarrhea i also took stool softener and fiber because the steroids and pain meds are constipating my hair all came out around day 14 so buzzed it off when it got bad i only wear the wig out of the house and go natural at home good luck with your first infusion and get lots of rest speechmom i had a lot of joint and muscle pain with the neulasta for ct 1 so have had the neupogen shots instead since then they caused me the same kind of pain and got my numbers back up so for me are worth the extra injections i needed two after ct 2 and 4 after ct 3 so we will see what ct 4 brings roby 7 i agree that plain water is hard to drink been adding a little bit of cranberry juice to the water which helps and also experimented with various kinds of herbal tea until i found one i could tolerate hope one of those ideas works for you hi started tamoxifen nearly a month ago just a few hot flushes and yes the aching of the joints like run a marothon my hair has also been coming out in handfulls started phsysio and hydrotherapy last week as having problems with movement in my arm following mx and snb 9 weeks ago keep crying not sure if this is because of the tamoxifen or because i was doing really well after the surgery made sure i did all the exercises and going great guns until my arm seized up resulting in having to do the physio etc or finally realising what has happened and that i have a further operation next year to complete the reconstruction and the uplift and that until then i have to be lopsided it help that friends work colleagues keep saying i look well it makes me feel guilty for not being back at work i work in the emergency services so woul be pretty useless with a arm that has no strenght in it at the moment it does help that i am not the only one experiencing the side effects hopefully it will all settle down once the body gets used to it still trying to keep positive hey there i switched from arimidex to tamoxifen last year after 5 years on arimidex mostly because of the same issue as you thining bones i did do 3 years of zometa and i do a lot of weight bearing exercise neither seemed to stop the osteopenia it was a hard switch for me it worries me that tamox may not be as effective as arimidex especially given the recent research but my onc was not comfortable with me continuing and i think that breaking a hip would not be in my best interests either also tamoxifen itself has bone building properties he did say that i could always switch back at a later date if my bones improved or further research indicated a strong survival advantage after 5 years and tamoxifen is still a really good drug so for now that is what i am taking good luck in your decision i wish there were not so many grey areas with this cancer stuff thanks for the kind words my wife does taxol 7 thursday so far some achiness and some tenderness with her nails she sees some lines on them other than that ok she has gotten neupogen shots following some but not all infusions hi jill sorry i been on line for a while i had a tough time on my last epi ended up in a and e with a raging temp and treated for a urine infection and then a chest infection laid up for quite a while i started my cmf on monday and i have been great on it apart from the nausea i tried doing what you suggested and taking the chemo tabs with the anti sickness meds and milk but it did not work for me i tried all sorts of different ways and ended up phoning clatterbridge who suggested taking all the chemo daily dosage together at once at night befiore going to bed and taking an anti sickness tab 30 minutes prior to the chemo tabs i tried it tonight and it seems to have worked it is though and i have been awake since but i did sleep for 3 hours prior to waking up how are you i guess that your radiotherapy must be finished by now eh how did it go take care love deb xx hi all been on anastrazole for about a month after being on tamoxifen for 2 years i am having the darndest time sleeping waking up times a night and having trouble going back to sleep i know that insomnia is a side effect of this drug but my question is does this side effect level off over time not a big pill taker so really want to go the sleep aid route and i know with tamoxifen my side effects from that leveled off after a few months thanks pat yoo hoooo xxxgood evening sisters i hope you are all having good moments inspite of being in this club do ya remember that gary glitter song dya wann be in my gang my gang my gang lol well that is whirling round my head oh my i am strange eh well today i worked 8am til 6pm i think i overdid it but i had to allow for my brain to get round the paperwork and the lad i worked with this afternoon does not stop yakking so i ended up counting over and over and saying adam please be quiet for 5 minutes lolanyway i went to the garage to buy some fuel on the way home i could have got it in the morning i wish i had on the counter was the evening newspaper with the headlines of two nurses dying of breast cancer a day apart my heart sank a million feet why are

do i feel really fed up and this is a drag and i want to die but hey the roundabout keeps on spinning and as long as i am travelling fast and keeping ultra distracted i guess healthy and the only way i know how to cope xxxxmy o h is on nights this week so i may start to dwell when i go to bed but as long as i know i have my sisters then i know i am safer you to me are everything and for those of you who have not pm me your addresses for some lil xmas cheer get to it or i will whip ya asses everyone valerie it is so good to see you i am thinking of you loads and hope you are living in the moment xxxxxmuch love xxxx thanks livinglife i saw my gyn yesterday and he simply fells thatmy hormones are kicking back in and that i am having my period again he is sending me for a blood test to check my hormone levels and as he says prove that i am not menopausal we shall see i asked him about doing a tvus and he feels that is not necessary right now i also called my onc today and am waiting for her to call me back i guess that if my blood test show that i am menopausal they will investigate further if my hormone levels show that i am still i will have to decide if i go back on tamoxifen or not i really want to i have to many bad side effects while on it other then really bad hot flashes and some weight gain more like bloating i think but i was really looking forward to being drug free i am still bleeding day 6 not very much but enough to feel like a period the question is has anyone out there resumed regular periods after 5 years of tamoxifen or is this just a one time deal to shed all that extra uterine lining and how long can i expect the bleeding to last before i start to worry i took aromasin for 5 years with no side effects other than slight hair thinning felt really good and actually did not want to stop them so you mainly hear about people with problems those without do not post usually hoping your experince will be like mine sam rhonda hmm very interesting about the iron had eye twitching and even inner ear twitching taxotere is part of my cocktail and just found out today that anemic hemoglobin is probably not that bad but got fluids today for the first time and they said the anemia would explain the exhaustion i guess i need to go popeye hope 49 yes i am a disneyland virgin but not a disneyworld virgin you would love the disney cancer center if for no other reason than smack dab in front of or across from disney studios my husband calls it the second happiest place on earth the mickey mouse water tank is clearly visible from the infusion room and the fence in front of the studios is mickey ears in iron photo cancernoway now i must google zumba it sounds like a greek vacuum robot on another note craving greek food first food craving had in days welcome to russell 33 hi amoc so sorry sometimes the emotional psychological side of this is neglected it is common for women to feel depression fatigue etc a while after treatment ends i have not heard that tamoxifen causes depression but many women do get leg pain which usually goes away after a couple months as far as the depression we all have gone through an acute trauma not surprising that we would have a psychological reaction we would expect a soldier whose life was threatened who went through physical trauma etc to come out without psychic pain i think okay to give ourselves the same understanding as far as it happening after treatment ends that that surprising either during treatment focused on treatment and we have a team of people paying attention to us when done sort of let adrift to cope with all of the stuff that a cancer diagnosis brings what trying to say is that while the feelings that having may not happen to all of us they are not abnormal for this situation not a doc but i think they call this situational depression meaning based in a particular set of circumstances just like normal to grieve after someone dies the good thing about this is that just time usually helps there are therapists who specifically deal with cancer patients as there should be your doc should be able to give you a recommendation for one these boards also help the other recommendation i would make is simply to take a walk every day i know how hard that can be to do especially if you live just about anywhere in the states this winter a little goal little achievable goals get up and shower make the bed seem to help whereas things like lose 30 pounds will send you flying straight back under the covers you let yourself have time for chemo treatment okay to also let yourself have time to deal with this stay in touch with us please many many hugs don 23 i am on tamoxifen started it after the ooph the joint pain you talked about can i askwhere do you get it i have had trouble at first after ooph i had a lot everywhere now mainly on right sideupper side leg it concerns me a bit my onc was not real concerned aboutit he said bone metpain gets worse and worse the pain i have seemstogo upand down i m just not ready to get a bone scan not mentally there yet i however want to be in denial either i guess my hope is that it is the lack of est fromthe ooph and the tamox i am sorry to ramble and make this about me i would love any feed back on this thanks sisters btw i color the crap out of my hair i did not now about the hair loss yikes faithfulheart catherine back from my neulasta shot i wanted to participate in a clinical trial but there was only one that i qualified for and my oncologist happy with the way it was set up so no clinical trials for me i might try to join something that monitors recovery from treatment etc marsha and catherine it feel great to be done with ac 4 on other other hand finally figured out how to deal with its side effects now there are a whole new bunch marsha did your onc give you any premeds or talk to you about wendy so lucky to have wireless service at the bar i must be on the wrong part of the ship pat i agree with marsha my onc thinks that i can do the taxol and that has benefits over weekly if i handle it then i can always go down to weekly i been having any side effects from the neulasta shot like leg pains etc so my onc nurse thought that i should be ok with the taxol see at least no more zofran and nausea the weather will be nicer too so i can get out and walk more which should help prevent the incipient weight gain and as i eat all my comfort food yes i do confess that i did have my ben and for lunch today ok waiting to hear from sybil from yesterday we still need freethought and tropicmom from today hillary i had the tamoxifen vs lupron arimidex talk with the mo week they want to start me on one of those options in 3 weeks all i heard was uterine cancer versus osteoporosis are any of you gals on lupron arimidex no periods sound like a great perk but i hear that the menopausal symptoms are worse is there a perk of one over the other with regard to fertility after a few years octo i always had wonderful teeth and i took care of them well i was told and read elsewhere to get any dental work done before chemo and i can attest to mouth issues during chemo so i went to the dentist i knew i had a few cavities but put off having them filled until jan 2015 when my better dental ins kicked in then suddenly i was up against it needing to get it all done immediately by this time i had 7 cavities and a crown had cracked there was no time for the slow approach getting done every two weeks i found a dentist who did it all under iv sedation in a couple of hours no delay to chemo not that i wanted more anasthesia not that i needed the expense if was 425 extra for the sedation but i had gotten uncomfortably close to the 90 day window to start chemo after surgery in the end i was happy done it no complications speaking of your mouth the taxanes taxotere and taxol can cause mouth soresand thrush in the blink of an eye i recommend the following which is what my mos head onc nurse told me keep baking soda a glass and a spoon in your bathroom every time you go in there and this is prophylactically 1 tsp in a glass of tepid water swish swish spit until gone i used a small glass if you are going in there to pee fix your face whatever do it every time i had mouth sores the first two infusions within days i stepped it up to many swishes per day and that fixed it i still had a burnt taste in my mouth that made coffee my favorite morning ritual unenjoyable separate issue also for mouth sores my onc nurse said no supplements except one 2 500 mg caps per day all other supplements and probiotics were stopped this is a much argued point but the fear is protecting the cancer cells they just done trials so they know best i thought to let the chemo do its job so no other supplements except the lysine you ladies will be very frustrated as you go through this process and you will hear directly conflicting instructions from different peoples mos there is no one standard of care i indeed was very frustrated too i listened to everything sometimes did my own research and then made my own decision if at all possible i followed my own mos direction because psychologically i needed to believe in him still do again sorry for the long post cheyenna so sorry you have to be here and it is really stressful when we have to make our own treatment decisions my diagnosis was very similar to yours other thanminewas multifocal and larger tumors i had 4 x ac last year not t but i have been on tamoxifen for 11 months so far and although they say the are harsher with ac especially long term of possible heart damage i have to say i managed quite well no neuropoathy no vomiting no nail problems honestly it was a lotmore tolerablethan i ever imagined making the decision and getting the first treatment out of the way was a big relief i obviously advise you on the best choice but whatever you decide i sincerely wish you the best sure there will be alot of other wonderful women that will chime in and share their experiences hugsbeth p have so far had 6 taxotere and feel that overall coping fine each cycle has been different for have given me very few problems some have been tougher tiredness and aches are worse than the nausea but certainly not bedridden although do tend to lie down for an hour or more most afternoons i have quite a few drugs which i take to counter the s e and have to say the drugs nowadays are first and domperidone for me and work really well so good not to have to contend with too much nasuea good luck with the treatment great news good to hear that despite the swelling they were able to continue with radiotherapy that is my concern although not due for that until june had my 3rd dose of fec yesterday so onto the t next i have found reflexology really helps ease the swelling temporarily until the next chemo i have an appointment to see a lymphoedema therapist next week as i have that mildly in my surgery side arm and i think she will look at my seroma area too which is good will be the same as you manual lymphatic drainage which i believe is gentle massage so if right it will be one of the more pleasant procedure had to endure congratulations on being a cancer survivor good to be seeing other ladies come to the end of their treatment gets that light shining at the end of our tunnels take care xxx hi all just looking for some suggestions am feeling i am slipping into a bit of a hole and know how to get out diagnosed in feb 09 and it has been 8 weeks since my 2nd operation full masc and have been on tamoxifen for nearly 3 weeks having night sweats that are affecting my sleep nausea from the tablets that last all morning and random aches and pains in my legs before diagnosed was on top of the world everything was going a long fine had energy had been losing weight and was near my goal and was working 2 part time jobs to set the family up financially now no energy no money no motivation i know that i am very lucky compared to a lot of women but at the moment not feeling that just having a little pity party but just need some kind words of inspiration to help me find my feet again what have other people done in this situation emma i had 3 rounds of fec and am on day 5 after first t h so far i have had less than the fec buti found fec to be culmulative and i know what is ahead of me fec was so bad that i met with my oncologist and we agreed on a smaller dose of t than she would normally prescribe for my size just to see how i got on i was told that nausea and vomiting were less with t but in my case this true the nausea started during my infusion even with emend and has continued since with vomiting the other fec there in such extreme levels for me so touch wood i end up bedbound and barely able to lift my head off the pillow been able to bathe most days so far which i do on fec a huge relief after fec i did taxol and have been finished with that since last march so almost a year i never did get the tingling but i did get some numbness in my fingers and feet moreso in the hands actually been noticing it more lately so it gone away or really improved any when i have to do another chemo that causes neuropathy i think look into the ice gloves i do too many things with my hands and just about kill me if i had to give up doing any of my needlwork or beadwork personally i believe in any of that holistic stuff and miracle cures for cancer or any other serious illness with diet herbs and supplements crap in my opinion at best eating a healthy and balanced diet at any time of life matter if young old sick healthy or whatever is either going to keep you healthy if you already are by warding off deficiency diseases and allowing one to maintain a healthy weight or can perhaps delay or slow down the effects of aging or diseases i also believe that a healthy and balanced diet when eaten by someone who is healthy can possibly reduce the risks of developing certain diseases in the first place and or maybe make people better able to withstand harsh treatments if they do get the disease in spite of eating a balanced and healthy diet and practicing other good health habits you know eat right exercise smoke drink die anyway lol but actual miracle cures for terminal illnesses through all those bizarre diets obscure herbs and esoteric supplements no way jose not in a million years the only alteration made to my diet since getting cancer was simply to eat less since i wanted to lose weight the damn ais stop with pain and depression they had to start making me fat as a pig too yuuuck 25 pounds down 5 more to go had my first taxol yesterday and was sick like a dog before the taxol drip due to decadron 5 the night before and 5 more at am and the drip at chemo thank you very much i actually had to vomit there that even happen with a c i take that next time i was sicker than with a c but i feel good today no weird smells etc had an apple for breakfast never happened before always needed carbs etc hopefully bone pain stays at bay doc said to take l glutamine and vit b6 100mg a day for neuropathy that is 5000 of the daily allowance in vit b6 seems like a lot but boy i am decadronworn just the word makes me sick lord knows i might not have been that nauseated with a c if i have to take it i read the description on d and it said side effect nausea helloooo arrrrggghhh hope you have a super thanksgiving you are in my prayers daily god bless i had a lot of joint pain when i first started tamo a few months ago also i would get really stiff after not moving sitting lying down and it took a minute to get warmed up i started taking glucosamine chondroitin and i notice the joint pain any more i actually feel like my old self not sure if my success is related to the glucosamine or just the fact that my body is getting used to the tamoxifen hi girls here is my info dx august 2007 idc stage 1 or 11a been referred to as both 2 cm largest tumor had bilateral mastectomy october 2007 with immediate implant recon 4 rounds of ac followed by 12 weekly taxol herceptin along with daily doses of tykerb i am currently having herceptin every three weeks and will continue this schedule until december 2008 was originally supposed to continue daily tykerb until december also but am currently taking a 6 week breather due to complications fingernail and toenail infections very painful may start agin on a lower dose after infection heals but will wait and see at this point my onc and i are assuming i am ned suze hi post chemo 3 weeks today my last 3 treatments were taxotere this morning i woke up with a numb right heel and the right edge of my foot i know neuropathy can be an se but this far out i expected that if i were to have it it would be during the treatments i was wondering when others got neuropathyfrom taxotere and how long it lasted thanks shelley had my first halaven treatment yesterday having some very minor nausea but not too bad exhausted anyway coming off my abraxane tig trial alpal do two weeks on one week off depending on blood counts if need be do day 1 day 15 then 2 off kind of up in the air good luck susan i tried the testosterone gel androgel you rub it on your arms i felt like it improved my mood and orgasm quality but do a whole lot for the actual desire aspect i had trouble sleeping to begin with and then it got worse with this but i was also on tamoxifen at the time which i felt was already contributing to the sleep issues i still have some and am thinking of trying it again soon just to see if different without the tamoxifen in my system my onc was all for using it as was my gyn who prescribed it i think menopause is the biggest culprit in this however because the majority of sex hormone production is made by the ovaries and once they stopped working as in chemopause or in my case natural menopause anymore i noticed the most difference i know this because i was perimenopausal already feeling the changes before i was even diagnosed with breast cancer i recently saw a naturopathic type internal medicine doctor and she prescribed a compounded mixture of estriol the safe form of estrogen and testosterone vaginal cream which i am going to pick up today unfortunately however since not a usual product that comes already packaged up and they have to make it up specially insurance cover it so for the 48 it will cost me it had better work it will help with vaginal dryness and according to the doctor the testosterone in it should help with arousability and sensations hi everyone happy spring the sunshine lift up your spirit these days after a long winter and 4 months of chemo i find it refreshing even if i ache and find moving around painful i have competed my chemo 4 rounds of a c 4 rounds of taxal dose dense i will admit it easy and by the end of the taxal treatments i wanted to quit but kept on going i now suffer from neuropathy in hands and feet and take gabapentin for that and have really sore legs and joint pain in my hips and back i feel like an old lady and walk like one some of the time i take oxycodoan straight and percacet for break through pain i am also taking calcium magnesium vitamine b6 b12 my acupuncturist has me on rehmannia six formula for the dizziness i feel i have been accpeted into a clinical trial study called rapid which stands for randomized trial of accelerated partial breast irradiation this is randomized a coin toss as to weather i get the partial treatment or whole breast partial only takes a week and whole will be 5 weeks has anyone on this forum had partial or heard of it your thoughts and insights would be so valuable to me thanks marlene from canada morning everyone just checking in to see how going with you all sounds like there is positive notes but as the rest of this roller coaster ride has been still the sudden shocks feeling better and my skin is feeling lots better saw my radiation onc this week and all is going good go back for 6 months to see him on my second month of the tamoxifen some hot flashes and joint pain but not too bad i am working full time with a little over time which wipes me out but need the extra money now so i just try to rest more when tired i am also looking forward to thanksgiving as i feel i have so much to be thankful for this year especially my children and grandchildren are all supposed to be here so that will be great you are all still in my thoughts and prayers carole i had so much bone pain with tamoxifen i only took it for 6 weeks however i have suffered from very painful leg cramps for years i get them in the early morning hours learned to get up and out of bed and to start walking around as soon as i feel a cramp coming on recently my primary care doctor suggested stretching exercises before i go to bed she said lactid acid forms in your legs during the day and can cause night time cramps stretching before bed helps to remove the lactic acid only wish i could remember to do the stretching before i go to bed hello all i just had 2 taxol yesterday has anyone noticed foul tasting burps after taxol like rotten eggs sorry if it is gross but i have wicked gas my taste buds are starting to go south my fingernails hurt too michelleo have u noticed the gas or fingernail pain my feet are def tingly allformy 4 soda hurts my throat too for about a week after each treatment i drink a lot of vitamin water it tastes good really cold hoping everyone has se free week jennifer linda i would think that the side effects of tamoxifen as a preventative before diagnosis would be different in intensity if not kind from those the rest of us get remember that for us tammy starts when our bodies are already debilitated by the cancer and the other treatments we have had the surgery the chemo and or the radiation my most difficult se has been fatigue which started in radiation then tammy caused sleep problems after 5 months on tammy i am sleeping almost normally and getting my energy and stamina back hi just want to add what i take i am 4 months post tch will have h til aug i take natural melatonin plus a natural menopause tab for night sweat and sleeplessness called estroven both help me hair it is coming in i went with out my wig starting last weekend and once i stopped wearing it it really started to grow so much so that my coworkers commented on its growth in a weeks time i also use a shampoo called biotin b complex shampoo for neuropathy i went to a neurologist and she gave me gabapentin and it has tamed it down a lot imathew it takes time to start feeling healthy again i have days when i feel great but it seam to get a little better each month fir me i think the herceptin makes my bones hurt especially when i get up from sitting makes me feel old so thanks for advising me on diep i am having it done may 17th and very excited if your done with tc of tch head on over to the hair hair hair board great group o there and hair growth pic lauren 15 i had my port put in on wednesday and chemo friday use the numbing cream they gave you and it might hurt abit from them pushing on it for a few seconds after the needle is all in i was much more comfortable you will feel some discomfort from the swelling but it will pass lawgirljenn i am on the same cocktail as you been blah also just really tired my brain has been slow too i guess foggy is the right term my ac is 3 weeks apart so i wont need the neustaia shot unless my counts dont bounce back the cytoxan gave me a funny burning feeling in my sinuses so yup claritin helped i read on this thread about regular claritin helped with bone pain too worth a look good night ladies after going through chemopause my periods came back regular as clockwork while i was taking tamoxifen and i only really suffered with hot flushes during the first couple of months the only side effect i would say i had and still have was fatigue i think your age has a lot to do with whether or not tamoxifen sends your body into menopause i was 32 when i started taking it but sure read posts from women who are nearing the age of their natural menopause continued to have periods with tamoxifen certain someone will be along to tell you more about this hope helped a bit though all the best mel x barb you are too funny you scared the sh__ out of yourself had my 3 mo and all is good i was down 16 pounds on his records i am now down 23 pounds according to mine yipee my oncologist says exercise is the key eating healthy is good but the one thing he believes that makes a huge differnce is the exercise the one thing i do right now of course i will just keep plugging away atmy weight loss he is taking me off tamoxifen and putting me on another medication that is just as effective and does not cause blood clots so not more blood thinners yeah i just hope the new medicine have weight gain as a side effect tori _ where are you are you done with rads yet how is your skin holding up re neulasta and what i wish i had known four months ago when i started chemoyesterday i had the neulasta shot had chemo 7 taxol two days ago and told my nurse how awful i feel the morning after the neulasta shot and then how completely horrible i feel once the taxol bone pain kicks in 2 days later she told me to take a whole lortab hydrocodone when i got home and keep taking a whole one every six hours for three days even though the night this is completely contrary to what my doc told me i should do but to hell with him been in such miserable pain for four months so i followed her recommendations and this morning i woke up with no pain at all from the neulasta for the past four months i have been waking up and crying from the pain after neulasta so now anxious to see if this prevents me feeling the bone pain from the taxol if so i think i should take a full page ad out in the new york times hi katherine am years down the line from bilateral mx and liver mets fec reduced the little blighters then they grew on tamoxifan so swapped to letrozole horrendous side effects on that including depression so am now having a break from drugs and having 6 weekly tumour markers and 12 weekly scans until they start growing again then more chemo i cope quite well during the day then at night i tend to worry about the time bomb inside me it is good to read on these forums that ladies are living for longer periods of time with mets and i hold on to that thought hope you are able to cope at the moment xx ukkate that ice pack idea is genius will be utilizing that tonight i am due for weekly taxol number two today at but my mo had me go in yesterday for a liver panel as my enzymes were up on mondays blood work she ordered it stat but still waiting on the results this really concerned me and caught me off guard as this was after only the first of 12 weekly taxols wondering how in the world my liver will tolerate 11 more bone pains are still pretty bad this is 7 days post taxol but praying they will call and say all is good for me to sit in the big green chair today counting down these treatments i wonder what the protocol is for monitoring after the chemo and rads i am stage 3 with 5 of 21 pos nodes had modified radical on right and simple on left had dcis and dc in left breast and lc and lcis in right breast was missed for many years surgeon said it started with the lobular and it is very slow growing and then caused the other two cancers left breast had 5 large tumors right breast plus 5 pos nodes that were big and three tumorsleft breast doc said she suspects tht the cancer was there when i was preganant with my youngest child she is now 8 and i was diagnosed in january the lobular cancer presented as fibrous tissue on mammo and since i was only 34 at the time with no history no further testing was done so here i sit they did get clear margins with mastectomies i had a bone scan brain mri and ct scan of abdomein and pelvis prior to surgery but never had a pet scan as so many of you have this has worried me my mo says that physical exams are pretty much all i will have after chemo this does not sound right to me and in light if the fact my cancer was missed for so long i live in fear i had been going to a very good haopital and that is where i had my surgery but switched for treatment to a local cancer center as the original hospital was over one hour drive each way and the se s were so terrible i didnt have the stamina to make the trip 3 times a week for counts fluids anti nauseas and chemo worried that i am not going to have the proper follow up what do you ladies have as far as follow up testing and monitoring becki i take dexamethason 4mg x2 twice a day for 2 days after treatment then nausea meds are as needed i have always taken either compazine 10mg or ativan 5mg for at least 2 days after never took zofran have pepcid 20mg too and took it after last ac as i had alot of heartburn issues for taxol next week mo says to start dex 24 hrs prior justine so sweet and glad it put a smile on your face i too still use shampoo on my bald head but do put lots of lotion on it too it seems always to be dry my work visit went well just made me emotional thus why i am up at 3am writing dear ladies starting taxol i have had a lot less physical trouble on taxol than on wanted you to know that not everyone has all the side effects that others have generally had none except for fatigue however still weary my emotional and psychological status stems from sure the months long grind of dx and tx in general it just seems to go on and on and on although i know there will be a day when actually done far away from now and that really tires me claire wasgij 96 pretty amazing good thing you caught it now i only had 4 chemo txs tch but because i had heart problems i only had herceptin with 2 of the 4 and then 8 more after completing chemo and radiation had to stop due to the ef drop so hard to say are you able to get a second opinion does anyone else have issues with abdominal support after pedicle tram i gained 50 lbs on tamoxifen before i quit it nasty side effects so much for that niftytummy tuck my belly is huge unweildy and uncomfortable and of course unrestrainable now that there are no abs behind most of it is there any type of support garment that helps off the tamox and finally losing weight but would love to have something to hold all those intestines back in there where they belong if there is such a thing that actually works hi ladies oh the joys of taxotere i have been done with treatments for over 3 years now after the first allergic reaction to taxotere which caused my chest to tighten up after about 10 minutes into infusion i had to be admitted to the hosp for every infusion so i could be watched the infusion was extremely slow it would take about hours just to do taxotere sometimes longer i had a whole cocktail of cortisones to suppress the reaction but i still reacted everytime including the last one they would give me around 100 mg of benadryl so i was really goofy but it cure the tight feeling in the chest of course with so much benadryl who cares i finished session of that crap it took me a few years to get over the fatigue i had carboplatin and herceptin as well also my eyebrows and lashes have been slow to grow back in and my hair is a bit thin i believe tho that dr slamon who invented herceptin likes to use the tch regimen taxotere carboplatin and herceptin all in all its doable but i hate taxotere anyone else have the same reactions tucker good saturday to everyone wow what a week my mom and have been visiting from michigan so i have been trying to keep them entertained i go for taxol 3 on monday then only 1 more to go there really is an end to chemo i can see it then i get to be nervous about radiation sure going to be much easier then chemo but the thought of getting the tattoos terrifies me not like deformed enought now i get to have blue dots on me i had to much trouble with taxol i have been having pain in my node removal area so much that yesterday i wear a bra i had to wear my cami from when i had my mastectomy my other breast has been giving me some problems as well i know if pms even though my perid shown up for 2 months but my breast has been painful i keep feeling for lumps but nothing there and the pain moves one day it will be one place and the next day the pain is somewhere else at times the pain even radiates down towards my ribs i know i have to say something to my onco but i am terrifed it will mean more tests and more waiting for results will this ever end i took my mom out on a casino boat the other day and we had a great time everyone was really nice but i did have this older gentleman that would not stop staring at me we were all standing waiting for the boat to doc in this hallway and he was literally staring then he moved closer and kept staring then look away staring and look away finally i said something to my and she must of gave him a dirty look because he look at me again i wait for my hair to grow back i think it started to a little and then i noticed the other day it was falling out again i hope everyone is doing well abbi glad to hear taxol went well ac is evil but i can handle the side effects of taxol have a great weekend everyone ginger hi izzi i had zoladex after my primary dx when i was 41 i had terrible hot flushes i mean really really bad these used to get me down but they did improve during the second year of zoladex it also used to cause me joint pain but only noticeable first thing in the morning i used to have the injection without using the numbing cream or spray no not brave it just really hurt as it is usually given in the stomach since my secondary dx 3 years ago age 46 i had zoladex for a couple of months before having my ovaries ablated so i could go onto aromatase inhibitors and suffered any noticeable menopausal symptoms other that the creakyness i guess this is because i was nearer my natural menopause the 2nd time around so it may be that you have too many i hope so nicky i have lung mets from the get go celebrating my two yr anniversary april fools day i had bmx chemo and rads in 2013 now on tamoxifen scans clear my biggest side effect is fatigue i blame tamoxifen for it i manage to take care of my two little ones house cleaning takes a back seat most of the time i generally lay down most afternoons but always sleep just have to prioritize very scary right now because you have a plan you can do this right now they are going to check everything i used my time waiting for results and surgery to clean clean clean it kept me busy they will be checking you out thoroughly i have just now graduated to every four months for scans but am still seen every two hang in there always someone here to help or listen sorry i kind of dissapear the last weeks here is an update about me i posted the same in the tc thread i started on tamoxifen on dec 25 and no se other than feeling extremely tired i also started working on jan 2 i feel tired mainly from work driving to meetings back and forth and catching up after four months of being on medical leave lots to do and somewhat stressed for being so behind my hair they are growing but i see a full coverage yet they started to grow a week or so ago but again thin and not the full head they must be now a quarter of an inch long i am wearing the cutest wigs and they look so real and always perfect i love them they are synthetic my nails they were dark after chemo 2 like a black shade i had them cut very small now i am leaving them longer and with dark nail polish a friend who owns a spa gave me organic nail polish and i am using that they are growing long and healthy still not going for manis or pedis i just got too scared of getting germs from places and my dh actually got mrsa from one pedi place that hapenned two years ago but after that and now my bc i am doing them myself at least for now until my strength come back as i said i still feel tired my weight i gained 30 lbs total between getting the bad news of bc 10lbs bmx lbs and tc lbs during the bmx i gained lbs mainly because i moving the pain is indescriptible you ladies know what i mean fluid retention is also an issue with the chemo and steroids during tc i was earing mashed potatoes for breakfast lots of carbs noodles potatoes bread that helped with the stomach cramps i took nexium and still do but because of the past ulcers my stomach suffered now i am on a diet only vegetables and fruits with small portions of meats nothing fried no carbs no sugars i have lost 7lbs without starving myself i am still swollen but that might take more weeks who knows my skin i had dry skin during chemo and for that i used neutrogena sesame oil after my showers on damp skin it worked very good plus the smell is very nice on my face i was washing it and right after i used any face cream i had still do the same i still have to ask my mo about botox but i will see him in two months so i have nothing to report on that topic oh i shaved my legs for the first time those little suckers grow faster in my legs than in my head i am using an electric shaver and use a razor anymore i read somewhere that shaving the armpits and using deodorant right after is not good i am using a deodorant i found that have aluminum chlorohydrate the brand is crystal essence and has a pink ribbon on the cap look good feel better i went there this past tuesday and the ladies were great lots of freebies and some good make up and tips i still have my lashes but they are thinning out same with my eyebrows i am not sure if i will lose them all at week 8 like somebody mentioned but at least i know now how to do them in case i lose them te i have my exchange scheduled for january i am thrilled about that it is so uncomfortable to sleep with the te and sleep on my side the muscles hurt some people say with the implants i will be able to move freely well that is all for now i will keep reading all your posts and keep us up to date aith your progress my first chemo was taxol carbo herceptin and the taxol made me very depressed and weepy my thinking was affected all of my thinking was very dark and defeated we tried and it was not tolerable for me once the chemo was stopped the dark fog lifted and i began to see myself moving forward and feeling better i have been on several other chemos and never had the type of depression that taxol caused share this info with her onc to see if she needs an or a change in chemo dosing i am too nervous to go on a chemo break with liver involvement things can head south quickly with the liver and we need it to process any life extending treatments i am hopeful that your mom will find renewed strength and courage to move forward stay strong darlene back from taxol 4 along with monthly zometa all my counts are staying good lost some hair but still have say of it i started some muscle cramping and hip pain this cycle but it resolves when i get up and move around so far so good wishing i could kiss bouncing ring jennifer thank you for mentioning this i feel reassured that your oncologist is in favor of taking this product i just signed up for the free offer there were only two cities in texas listed for stores that offer it otherwise be trotting to the store to get some today 21 months into tamoxifen now and tired of being tired not as bad as when i finished rads the phrase bonecrushing fatigue was suddenly my reality it felt like my very bone marrow was being squeezed within an inch of its life so thankful not so bad as that anymore but plenty bad enough for me to complain survived cancer and its treatments high time to do some rejoicing for a change i have been on femara letrozole for 5 yrs with no issues i can say it has caused i had been osteopenia for many yrs huge family history on both sides and in those yrs have gone on to osteoporosis would have happened if i did nothing but is handled by fosamax i do occasionally have some cramping in feet ankles but again that started before femara letrozole and is because during taxol i started having issues with low potassium levels and still do it is handled with adding more potassium pills to keep level up i have never had hot flashes not even when i went through natural menopause at 44 i have not gained any weight or been limited in anything i want to do no one can know what their individual experience will be as we are each so unique do not dwell in the negative negative brings on negative everyone should educate themselves about the possibilities but do not assume that you will experience any or all the ses collectively that are posted it is very easy to find the negative and get stuck there there is positive but unfortunately the negative gets more attention choose to dwell in the negative of others no matter what may come to you live your life to the utmost not be crippled by fear based on what others say their experience was is i guess a way to say it is i am me you are you others are others there was actually a study that came out recently and i think it was posted on showing evidence of chemo brain in general and finding that women may begin showing signs before they start chemo raising questions as to whether actually directly related to the cancer it was interesting i can tell you my concentration and memory has been crappy since my dx and that could very likely just be due to the fact that when you get a dx like this yes it will mess with your mind i had my first tx today i did ice my fingers and toes so far feeling fine just tired need to go to bed soon hoping to work part of tomorrow before going in for neulasta i also hope i can make it through friday night before i get hit with any of the other symptoms stomach so far is behaving had a martini and turkey burger with friends at a local pub tonight i was going to skip it but i felt pretty good and figured i want to grab as much normality as i possibly can regarding that study on gloves i found them on amazon marked down to about 100 i could get them but i think stick with the ice or possibly buy the frozen peas i never remembered to pick them up but the fusion center had crushed ice that worked well i think my onc and the nurse did a good job at going through all the possible ses they were impressed that i was aware of them and had done my research of course i was reassured that many were rare the nurse in the infusion center said seen women who chew ice during adriamycin have had mixed results with preventing mouth sores i tried it anyway if anything it was a more interesting way to hydrate as opposed to slurping more water down anyway i hope these lingering ses that all had eventually clear up right now my 1 goal is to wipe out this cancer but so frustrating that we sometimes wind up sacrificing so much when all is said and done good thing all strong i finished w weekly taxol two weeks ago with mastectomy in two weeks my eyelashes and eyebrows stayed the entire twelve weeks but are no very very thin nearly gone how long before they grew back in did others have to use latisse or other growth enhancements to get them to grow back my hair started growing back about week six on taxol i look so bad but now i look like a troll with no lashes or brows have been on tamoxifen for about 7 months now i have had episodes of cramping with no period and yes they are accompanied by nausea i also had bouts of diarrhea my periods have been very irregular 50 but before tamoxifen my periods were still every 4 weeks now they have been as far apart as 12 weeks last time was 4 weeks though i find that my symptoms have gotten better with time i hope you get some relief from your pain i took ibuprofen but if nauseated probably not such a good idea try a heating pad or warm bath mary welcome to the newcomers and a huge congrats to those of you who have finished chemo nursenay fwiw i began with three fec treatments found them very very doable then the last three involved taxotere docetaxel and herceptin just say i haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaate taxotere ses for me were neuropathy in the feet esp has since cleared as i finished chemo on nov 9 2012 tearing of the eyes mouth sores fatigue herceptin was given on the same day as the taxotere i just finished my 12th of 17 herceptin sessions yesterday herceptin for me is very very doable almost no ses to speak of best of luck with your treatment btw someone said fec is more common outside the u s a and i do reside in canada finally i drank copious amounts of mostly water during the entire treatment regimen continue to do so exercised throughout the first three rounds of chemo then exercised once i could usually day 5 after chemo i had 12 weekly infusions of taxol also the first week took much longer than the others because it was a triple dose that week i also received herceptin and zometa it took about 6 and a half hours after that it took about two and a half hours each week when i took only taxol and herceptin seems as though things are done differently in different places but in my case every taxol treatment started with drips of pepcid and decadron i guess the pepcid worked because i was never bothered with nausea or vomiting never thank heaven the decadron certainly caused sleeplessness after 2 weeks my onc cut that dosage in half as others have already said the side effects associated with taxol can include fatigue neuropathy very dry nasal passages and eyes muscle and bone soreness and effects on your nail beds one problem that the docs seem more concerned with is if you develope a rash you may experience all of these side effects or the good news is that they will likely pass after the treatments are done as for the herceptin it seems to be very tolerable by itself there are no really obvious side effects and your hair should grow back even while you take it happy for you that you have a port it is so much easier than trying to access a good vein every week best wishes as you continue through your journey marsha today is taxol 9 only 3 more weeks after today fatigue seems to be my major se with a little muscle ache thrown in for good measure i have neuropathy in both my hands and feet but not too bad i just keep thinking i can do anything for ___ fill in the blank more weeks 5thsib sorry about your back aches and the headaches i do get the headaches sometimes but tylenol seems to do the trick for me paula good luck tomorrow not finding the ses to get better still tired maybe just sick and tired of this chemo business take care georgetta dr switched me to tamoxifen from femara in january i had hot flashes with the femara especially at night but now hardly ever during the day with the tamoxifen but at night i feel at times like i am burning up and sweating so much my hair is wet and i have to go change and i only sleep in boxer shorts and a tank top even the sheets get wet if my husband in the bed i would roll over to the other side yeah my dr suggests yoga too just too hyper for something like that and i have tried but just keep on looking at the clock for when i can get up and go defeats the whole purpose of the class laurais 50 i hope all goes well for you so many factors go in to our treatment plans and decisions we all have to do best for ourselves ac is tough and you should be proud for making it through so well haha basia yet being the operative word at taxol 3 and have the benedryl yawns around me is a woman graduating after almost 1 year of treatment and a newbie who has no idea going on she missed the tlc beginning chemo class very focused on the hair loss which i never really was a pain in the ass wearing a wig to work but it will grow back i hope i want to go hug her here alone and making me so sad was going to skip my last neulasta but changed my mind need to get my counts up for another chemo but been lucky to recover quickly and had any infections want to mess with success so two more bone pain shots boo hiss chris taxol is waaaay better then the ac so far i have had a stomachache for the last few days and was hoping the dr would just let me know what i could take over the phone but they made me go to urgent care yesterday for some meds i also have some aching in my legs with some toe cramping but it is all easier then ac the best thing is the taste in my mouth is not as bad and i feel like in a fog hair i usually wear a buff or a turban when i go out the wig is too uncomfortable i did go bald when the ball hit me last week and i think that helped me get over anyweird feelings i had i wear anything at home unless cold body image ok i am a major chunky monkey though i have lost 11 lbs on the ac i still have quit a ways to go i have freaked a few times looking in the mirror right after my mastectomy but fat lady one big boob baldhead and glasses was not a pretty picture but with my loving husband of 33 years and his always grabbing me i have come to feel moreaccepting of mein this new skin if any of you have already gone through menopause like myself during perimenopause and then menopause i went through the mood swings the constant weeping the hot flashes etc my gyn recommended a pyschiatrist that specialized in i took wellbutrin for the past 9 years and it definitely helped with the mood swings etc however it did nothing for hot flashes i stopped because i think i needed it any more 61 and still get hot flashes i meet my oncologist in 2 weeks and will definitely have to talk to him about side effects i had one sister 49 who had dcis lumpectomy radiation tamoxifen for 5 years no side effects other than hot flashes another sister 53 had lumpectomy 7 lymph nodes chemo radiation arimidex for 5 years no side effects other than hot flashes i had bilateral mastectomies last week met with my oncology surgeon and went over pathology report before surgery he thought i would need chemo and radiation bc tumor cm i am estrogen progesterone and my margins were clean and no lymph node involvement so he believes the oncologist will only put me on 5 years of tamoxifen or something else char kj i think the adriamycin is hard on the heart as well as the herceptin i imagine any of these drugs are easy on it though i hope your eating is getting glad the fluids helped peacockgal that is awesome about the gym that would make me happy too i can workout at work but i am not comfortable without hats and such during the day and i have no energy at night i am happy for you mamastewart i am glad you got to come home i hope the fluids helped and that the cipro keeps infection away audra hope that port is healing i could eat today with no zofran yahoo some days the little things hoping for a good day for all okay me too so nice to hear from some of the junies glad everyone seems to be moving on bonnie so glad your husband is doing better and good luck with the thyroid debbie the sidecar sounds great where is the gifford pinchot nat forest dawn i really hope the liver counts are meaningless and your mom is doing well terry cancer sucks so much but i may be one of those that likes her life more now than mean glad i got it though glad you are tolerating the arimidex on aromasin and i really notice still have joint pain but had it since taxol melody thanks for the hugs as far as palpitations i have had them my whole life but they do seem to occur a bit more often since chemo but had an ekg too and my heart is strong since always had them so has my mother i really worry about it too much in fact i will say that i am strangely not too worried about a recurrence either and i thought when i was done with tx that i would be i felt very depressed during rads even though i had no problem with it and would cry all the time but within days of finishing i felt so good i was so sad for so long that i was sure i would never feel joy again but i do i feel really joyful now i think a combo of being done and not really done since getting herceptin having some hair about 1 and our beautiful spring days we had a very cold us just glad to be happy again and i do feel that many things not health related are better now i have a clarity about important to me that i have before cyndi hi jennie i just finished radiation last week 15 regular treatments and 3 boost and previous to that four cycles of chemotherapy which included an allergic reaction to taxotere i also had an allergic reaction to inh for latent tb just after finishing chemo now that i am finally finished all my treatments i go back to see the medical oncologist this thursday to start tamoxifen i gained about 8 lbs during chemo i had weight to lose prior to starting any of these treatments and now i have a bit more to lose i want to hear what she recommends for getting back in shape i did look into the livestrong program which is held at a local ymca unfortunately the program is only offered during the day and i work no chance of my getting there the director of the in my area is looking to start another livestrong program at another ymca but probably have that ready until next spring one of the hospitals in my area is doing a yoga for cancer for free six weeks in the evening and i am thinking of giving it a try i thought it would be a nice way to end all this treatment and start fresh again i have energy but not a lot of endurance i know i need to exercise change up my diet and lose weight it will take time i was walking on my treadmill and then when the boost radiation started i just got too tired to even do that i will get back on track today though i want to get stronger for next spring so i can garden without all the huffing puffing and sitting in between plantings i will give myself some goals to aim for next year and then develop a plan to get there i want to thank you for starting this thread keep trying change things up as needed are you working towards a specific goal are there any free programs in your area for cancer patients even at the hospitals i took tamox for 5 years and now take have the insomnia find melatonin works well 3 mg about an hour before bed to make me a little drowsy in order to fall asleep but it keep me from waking up again in the night i take it most nights but my problem i think is more that i stop issues i somehow just need to learn to quiet my mind for i also started tamoxifen a week before i started radiation my mo said some people like to finish radiation first but she saw no reason to delay starting hormone therapy my main se from rads is fatigue from tamoxifen is hot flashes and night sweats and i believe i am still dealing with fluid retention from chemo i wish i had a better idea of the duration for the chemo as a few of them are hanging in there i think i have had 16 rad txsand starting to see some skin changes now it is getting pinker plus it feels a little tight 9 to go cool breeze i enjoy reading about your hair loss its my predictor ii think you are three weeks ahead of me on abraxane my hairis so thin its see through but happily i still have bangs i still have enough hair that when i wear a baseball cap people think wearing a baseball cap this helps me keepmental balance newest problem is horrible pain in my ankles and thighs i was freaking out yesterday thinking it was progression i reread the side effects and i now think its a side effect oddly this is my week off and the pain has intensified the past two days do side effects come and go or do they stay and intensify flyjune i agree with specialk and the others i have never heard a compelling argument for adriamycin given that you will also be on herceptin 2 drugs that can damage the heart maybe there is one but a small potential decrease in recurrence v a much increased likelihood for a serious heart problemdoesnt seem like a good trade off for me i was lucky and my side effects were pretty mild i work for myself out of my home so i was able to have some reduction in my schedule without it being too obvious i think you should take the semester off this is a bfd and you need to make sure your body has all the rest it needs to fight the cancer and deal with the harsh drugs youll be on on another note i kept my hair thanks to penguin cold caps they are an expensive pita but were worth it for me you can check out the cold caps thread i was node negative and i know lago was as well special k bren and tonlee all had positive nodes and were given tch you can scroll through this thread and see sorry you have to be here and good luck whatever you choose to do has anyone been told that it might be dangerous to switch to tamoxifen after several years of arimidex my oncologist and i have been talking about the possibility of me switching from arimidex to tamoxifen for the last two years i even had the test to find out if i was a good metabolizer of tamoxifen i am as i approach five years of arimidex i now feel the side effects have become too debilitating and damaging to my life to continue yet as stage ii lobular i feel i could definitely benefit from more years of protection my compromise was to switch to tamoxifen for a few five years since i am a good metabolizer but i have now heard that at least one major breast cancer center in boston recommends against this warning that it might be dangerous the theory is that after a period how long on an ai the newly awakened estrogen receptors may react to tamoxifen as an estrogen rather than an scarey they recommend that those with stage ii continue with the ai for several more years yet i know there is a two or three year old clinical trial looking at it has not been stopped as far as i know and my onc has never expressed any fear about making this switch i have developed osteoporosis on arimidex have all the commonly experienced joint pains severe vaginal atrophy had to stop estring two years ago because it raised my estradiol too high and worst of all i feel my brain is increasingly foggy i now see there have been small scale studies comparing cognitive impairment on ais and tamoxifen finding that impairment with ais may be significant but not on tamoxifen same with vaginal atrophy bone loss etc etc i really want to get off this arimidex train has anyone else explored a switch to tamoxifen after many years on an ai anyone heard of any preliminary results from the tamoxifenclinical trial i see my onc in sept to discuss this again thanks for any experience with this issue kay hi everybody yes taxol is much better on day 5 and no nausea to speak of feel good little aches and pains mainly from nuelasta so far taking taxol nueropothy b vit and acetyl l cartinine and glutamine supplements feel like ac was years ago hopefully to be forgotten soon hopefully they will lower steroids after 2nd one hi stena thinking of you and praying for you with radiation starting thursday its already thursday in australia radiation was much easier that i anticipated according to all i had heard i attribute this to the advice i was given my radiation oncologist does firmly believe that if you walk for at least 30 mins after your treatment it gives the body a chance to re balance itself after the radiation onslaught as he calls it drinking plenty of water does a good job of rehydrating you and using heaps of cream protects the skin my friend who had 6 wks of radiation treatment just 2 months prior to me gave me heaps of good advice and she breezed through it too i certainly be fearful if ever it was essential for me to need radiotherapy in the future i also scheduled the daily treatment into my life as an essential on my advice so that i resent the daily trips to the hospital but appreciated the medical facilities that were so available to me what a blessing to have such treatment and support available as well i planned special treats each day like meet a special friend afterwards or go to a coffee shop for a recharge another husband bought her scratchie tickets one for each treatment day and she won 100 towards the end i have another friend who was too tired to do the walking hates drinking water and use much of the cream especially straight after the radiation she did not fare so well as for tamoxifen i too was not keen to take it as i got vertigo when taken hrt however while the first 3 months was a little difficult it soon improved it is said that that is the usual time it takes to sttle down i had a few panic attacks i had experienced these 30 yrs earlier after excessively high temps during malarial episodes i had no depression no vertigo i was a little tired and had vaginal discharge after that it all settled down and from then i even feel that i am on tamoxifen via the side effects so hope that helps you my prayer is you will cope easily with it all now i look back if ever i have to do it again which i hope i will not i will happily do it all over leggyj sorry to hear had such a rough time i have neuropathy both from chemo a year ago for colon cancer and the taxol i had a few months ago my feet and fingers are numb and tingly but thankfully i have no pain except when i get cold i am on disability still because even though i am finished with chemo and rads i work because my job involves being outside for an hour i do recess at an elementary school i know going to take a long time for the neuropathy to go away and it might not ever go away completely but since not painful i can live with it i hope things improve for you and you can get some relief bekah i love when you post hair pictures mine is coming in a little bit mostly gray and i see a bit of black someday my husband and i will have the same haircut salt pepper i still look very bald though i must say bc survivors are awesome we are doing a program called ulster project this summer we have northern ireland teen living with us because i need to add more onto my plate lol yesterday the entire group went to mass and a striking woman sat down next to me during the dinner afterwards after awhile she asked if i had breast cancer of course i grabbed my wig and asked can you tell i was wearing my good wig painted my eyebrows in very well and even had the false eyelashes on well she remembered me from another meeting in which i came in a fancy headwrap anywhohow she was was wonderful and 7 years out so nice to talk with survivors rather than those healthy people having a rough time with head sweat i keep hoping it will be done when finished taxol but i think wishful thinking my sleep patterns suck i even know how i function during the day anymore wow had a rough week following chemo ast wednesday 3rd ac so checked in big changes hmmm ggm my 2 grandson is coming in on friday with his mom and 2 sister how did you handle the bald head with gavin i wear headcoverings for the most part but i know ask tell me to take hat off mimi i mentioned writing on my head with markers but my daughter said that an option since trying to teach him not to write on his body need your wisdom glad to see you on the ilc board the conversation has revved up lately wing my oncologist has said the same about the dd taxol but after looking at all the most recent studies i am leaning towards 12x weekly the results are the same which is what he is looking at with less time but the side effect profile is much better w the 12x weekly regimen there were some articles posted this summer from the 2013 american society of clinical oncology annual meeting comparing the two though the dd taxol was 6 rounds to get the full 12 weeks weekly had more side effects i e low white blood cell counts and the taxol had more allergic reactions bone pain and neuropathy the doctor that presented was actually from memorial where the dd taxol approach was pioneered and said that the results would change the way that he practiced 12x weekly with fewer side effects anybody with more input on this please share i have one more ac next wednesday so he has given me three weeks to decide sharon so sorry about your dad my mil broke her first hip last december and the second after being home a from rehab in february 90 been hard because she still wants to live alone and the only ones close by so am thankful that you have other siblings that can take on some of the caretaking of her while you take care of yourself will be praying for you and thanks for the offer of laundry etc i sure wish that you were close enough that i could take advantage of it just sayin saltyjack i will send you a personal message i think we have way more in common than just our dx sorry to know your mom is not feeling well because of side effects what chemo is she taking there are a lot of options for her before the hospice talk what is wrong with her oncologist if she is stable thsese are good news if she has neuropathy and she does not have energy it might be because her oncologist needs to lower her chemo dosage or maybe try something else since 2005 i had several liver and lungs mets in 2006 my liver mets were gone and since then i have been fighting lung mets i had taxotere hercetin nalvabine herceptin gemzar herceptin xeloda herceptin and now on ixempra herceptin and there are many more options for your mom my side effects were mild the worse has been with ixempra with very strong numbness in my hands and feet and i feel very tired too i wonder if your mom is taking ixempra taxotere also gives neuropathy even though i did not have it when i used it my doctor had to lower the dosage of ixempra for me to tolerate the drug i take vitamin b6 and power for the neuropathy without the knowledge of my doctor because everything i ask if it is ok to take he says it will not help let me know if i can be of any help i hope your mother will find the right treatment and the right doctor that will give her more quality of life and give up on her so soon hugs for both of you karlav it was not like statins i was put on lipitor a few years ago omg saw a rheumatologist and finally a neurologist before we figured it was the lipitor they admitting much back then i am on pravastatin now water based and does not store up in your body the leg pain with the anastrozole was more of a bone pain but not excruciating lots of mild cursing and just bad enough to disrupt sleep they know why iodine fixes it just does i have been on arimidex for almost 2 years and whilst my only real complaint initially was hot flushes for the last year i have been getting pain and stiffnes in my knees particularly in the morning and also in the night which sometimes wakes me up i know i am of the age group where it could be but there is no swelling pain killers help a bit but i want to take these regularly i have always blamed too much yoga or gym work outs but wonder if anyone else has experienced knee pain thanks for the info donna i still want to tough it out and take the last taxols for four weeks but my family and dr think i should make the switch to taxotere not really sure what to do the taxol has not made me nauseous no diarrhea or side effects other than neurpothy and fatigue sounds like taxotere has more side effects will have to decide by wednesday i just want to get these last four finished and to decide the lesser but most effective of two evils have a great sunday all lynnie so sorry you are having wound healing problems my abdominal incision opened and it took 4 months of packing before it finally healed my ps had to debride it too mine was caused by trauma to the abdominal area in the hospital after my surgery i ended up with a mrsa staph infection and they put me through a lot of scans where i had to lay flat extremely painful and stressful to the tight incision possible that my wound took a long time to heal because i was immediately put on navelbine and herceptin never heard that tamoxifen causes healing delays but hopefully someone else will be able to help you still if you have had healing issues for the past year did you have surgery in 2008 healing problems can also be due to other factors such as metabolism problems be sure they check out your thyroid diabetes causes healing delays smoking not enough protein in the diet etc etc if your plastic surgeon been helping you get answers to your questions with your primary care doctor mine was fantastic and really helped put my mind at ease especially because my ps had blinders on about my troubles hang in there and i hope get the answers you need soon i started herceptin with taxol in jan 2008 i finished taxol with serious side effects in mar 2008 then i started radiation i put on weight and my asthma got considerably worse i attributed the runny nose to not having nose hairs i had the same symptom on ac after i lost my hair my muga scans in may indicated congesstive heart failure from the herceptin we stopped the herceptin in may the next muga scan in july indicated no improvement and my numbers continued to drop i am due for another muga scan and a visit with a cardiologist now one year later because my ps is afraid that i still have chf if so my recon surgery will be delayed again and it may mean changes to my options hi everyone guitargrl patty aurora i actually did hire an attorney about a month ago he told me that i have a chance of winning or he take the case you all got it when you said discrimination this might take some time to fall into place but let you know the outcome i mention it at first as i actually was embarrassed not that kind

class yesterday it was two hours and a nice afternoon some of the makeup colors me like purple mascara i was laughing but some were it was fun i met some very nice women all going thru the same thing we shared our stories and there was a strong bond in the room but the reality of my breast cancer really hit me as i was sitting in that room i looked around and thought to myself i believe here for this reason just kind of slammed me i came home and was very anxious and get my act togethereven had trouble falling asleep last night guess another reality hit home for me aurora on a 4 cycle treatment dose dense every other week with the a c after that they are treating me with the taxol after this treatment only have one more of the a c most likely on yay grannie my hair was buzzed off about two weeks ago and it hurt too i have patches now ready for the rest to fall out so i have to clean up after it anymore one of the girls in the lgfb class suggested that i take packing tape place

said and very common ses after reading up on it and talking with you all here i am already taking so many pills i want to add any more medicines or tests if i can help it drpuren welcome i am going for taxol 2 this week doing every other week not weekly but my side effects from taxol have been totally different from ac with ac i had severe nausea fatigue the first days and then a constant yuck feeling and awful taste in my mouth the rest of the time even when i felt better i have any nausea with my first taxol the worst part was aching from head to toe from days and extreme fatigue i feel so much more tired now than i did on ac but overall i think better than the yucky feeling with ac jennifer i am so very sorry you are having to deal with this the neulasta can be a killer with the taxane and the bone pain but it sounds like your doc got you on some good meds have you asked about another taxane like taxol perhaps it would be better tolerated just curious i hope you find some relief i will be keeping you in my thoughts and prayers catinitial diagnosis 2005 idc 3cm stage iib nodes er pr her 2 recurrence 2009 extensive bone mets diffuse liver mets just wanted to put together a few studies found on herceptin and kadcycla if anyone has any good studies let me know and add them trastuzumab regimens for early breast cancer the review includes eight trials that involved women with her 2 positive operable breast cancer who were assigned by chance to receive trastuzumab or not trastuzumab is always paired with a standard chemotherapy as starting treatment but it can also be continued alone or with medications such as an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen women were followed by clinicians for several years three on average the review found that trastuzumab significantly reduced recurrence and mortality some patients in treatment develop severe heart toxicity i e congestive heart failure chf breast cancer mortality is reduced by but the risk of heart toxicity is five times more likely for women receiving trastuzumab than women receiving standard therapy alone if 1000 women were given standard therapy alone with no trastuzumab then about 900 would survive and five would have experienced heart toxicities if 1000 women were treated with standard chemotherapy and trastuzumab for one year about 933 would survive 33 more women will have their lives prolonged about 740 would be free of disease recurrence 95 more women will not experience the disease return and 26 would have serious heart toxicity 21 more than the chemotherapy alone group due to the drug these heart toxicities are often reversible if the treatment is stopped straight away cd006243 pub 2 abstract jsessionid c20843598ee21e274bcdd68940758ec0 f01t04 mojas 2012 years after treatment for her 2 positive early stage breast trastuzumab continues to show benefit the study reports long term findings years from two randomized phase iii studies that led to u s food and drug administration approval of herceptin use in early stage her 2 positive breast cancer they found that the use of trastuzumab produced a 37 percent improvement in survival and a 40 percent reduction in risk of cancer occurrence compared to patients treated with chemotherapy alone the findings also confirmed safety of trastuzumab dr perez says over eight years there was no increase in the incidence of secondary cancers and only a minor increase in heart problems she says mayo clinic 14 this is a good review of trastuzumab and similar drugs and various combinations among them therapeutic considerations in treating her 2 positive metastatic breast cancer the advent of trastuzumab a monoclonal antibody to her 2 revolutionized the management of her 2 positive breast cancer bc in the metastatic and adjuvant settings however relapse despite adjuvant trastuzumab and resistance to trastuzumab in the metastatic setting remain substantial clinical problems for many patients with her 2 positive bc there has been progress with the approval of three additional her 2 targeted agents in the last six years lapatinib pertuzumab and emtansine 1 other her 2 targeted therapies including neratinib and afatinib are in clinical development and trials of novel agents such as heat shock protein 90 hsp 90 inhibitors phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase pi3k inhibitors and her 2 targeted vaccines are ongoing in addition to developing new therapy research is addressing several unique challenges in the management of her 2 positive mbc in this article we discuss advances in the treatment of her 2 positive mbc

lymphocytes in breast cancer patients with her 2 tumors suggest that there is a small subgroup of patients about 10 who may not benefit from the addition of trastuzumab herceptin genentech inc to chemotherapy this small proportion of patients who had high levels of in the tumor specimens did well whether they were treated with chemotherapy alone or with chemotherapy plus trastuzumab suggesting that these patients may not need trastuzumab sparing them side effects and reducing costs however this research is too early yet to influence clinical decisions chusteka 14 systemic targeted therapy

it indicate how long treatment was 1 or 2 years study finds trastuzumab ratio favorable in long term the results of this analysis confirm that the incidence of cardiac dysfunction is relatively low approximately 3 and the late development of cardiac toxicity is infrequent dr pooja p advani of the mayo clinic in jacksonville florida told reuters health by email older age 60 or older hypertension and lower baseline heart function ejection fraction are associated with an increased risk of cardiac dysfunction in summary trastuzumab continues to have a favorable ratio she added mayo researchers previously reported on years cardiac safety in the ncctg n9831 trial in this new analysis dr advani and colleagues reported on cardiac safety during a median of years there has been some concern regarding the risks of cardiac effects from trastuzumab and whether the cardiac dysfunction is truly reversible dr advani told reuters health our results are fairly consistent with other pivotal studies and demonstrate a small but stable rate of cardiac events after chemotherapy plus trastuzumab with recovery of the ejection fraction in over half the patients who developed heart failure overall these results are reassuring and support that trastuzumab is the cornerstone for treatment of her 2 positive breast cancer hand 15 recommendations on what drug combinations should be first and second line treatment for advanced her 2 positive bc treatment of her 2 positive advanced breast cancer with 1 a review of the literature 1 is characterized by an innovative and selective mechanism of action on the her 2 positive tumor cells through this mechanism 1 leads to a double antitumor effect an 2 effect mediated by the trastuzumab activity and a selective transport of a powerful antimitotic agent dm1 to the intracytoplasmic area this particular mechanism of action increases the effectiveness while it reduces the toxicity regarding the results of the marianne trial 1 is and less toxic than trastuzumab taxane in first line however taking into account the substantial improvement in os obtained in the cleopatra trial swain et al 2015 in which the combination of docetaxel trastuzumab pertuzumab increased os in months vs docetaxel trastuzumab placebo the dual combination of trastuzumab taxane cannot be considered as the standard first line anymore thus marianne results are insufficient neither 1 or 1 pertuzumab were superior to trastuzumab taxane in this context the cleopatra study arm docetaxel trastuzumab pertuzumab remains the preferred in metastatic her 2 breast cancer being 1 an apparently less effective alternative thus 1 in first line could be an option reserved for patients not suitable for pertuzumab because of high risk of cardiac adverse events after the emilia results 1 has shown superiority vs lapatinib and capecitabine which was the standard second line in many centers considering the significant improvement in survival and better toxicity profile 1 can be considered as the preferred after previous treatment with trastuzumab taxane finally taking into account the data from the theresa trial in those patients not previously treated with 1 in second line the administration of this compound in third or later lines should be recommended 1 in second line and later after progression on trastuzumab and taxane based therapies or in an early relapse within 6 months after the completion of the adjuvant treatment is associated with a better outcomes significant increases in terms of duration of response pfs and os safety profile and favorable clinical tolerabilityfor patients with advanced her 2 positive breast cancer compared with other available therapeutic 1 mg kg every 3 weeks is well tolerated and safe without cardiotoxicity and no dose adjustments appear necessary in heavily pretreated patients martinez 2015 edit 15 to add was given a really interesting article on how herceptin may keep micrometasteses on bone from growing even in her 2 negative patients university of michigan study challenges notion of using herceptin only for her 2 positive breast cancer a recent study based on new analyses of old data found some tumors were incorrectly categorized as her 2 positive and as a result those women received adjuvant herceptin it turns out they benefited as much from the treatment as woman with actual her 2 positive cancer the researchers had previously shown her 2 plays an important role in cancer stem cells the small number of cells in a tumor that fuel its growth and spread these cells represent 1 percent to 5 percent of all the cells in a tumor they are resistant to current chemotherapy and radiation treatments but since they express her 2 they are effectively targeted by herceptin further the researchers in this new study found that for tumors classified as her 2 negative her 2 levels were higher in bone metastases compared to the primary breast tumor bone is the most frequent site to which breast cancer spreads the researchers administered herceptin to mice with these bone lesions and found that it was most effective when given early when tumors were small or mere micrometastases in these cases herceptin almost completely blocked the tumors from growing when the drug was given later after tumors were established it had little effect university of michigan comprehensive cancer center 13 edit on 15 to add this is a small restrospective study but showed a strong benefit from vitamin d improved clinical outcomes associated with vitamin d supplementation during adjuvant therapy in patients with nonmetastatic her 2 positive breast cancer in our final multivariate model vd vitamin d supplementation was associated with improved disease free survival hr 36 zeichner 2015 lauram i think its going really well i have as much swelling or water retention with the last chemo unfortunately the i had to cancel the last week and a because of chemo and i am really swollen with the taxotere even my eyes lids are swollen i thought i was in the clear doing the exercises on my own i went to the onc yesterday and she said its the taxotere not the lymphedema i will be stopping the therapy i have to keep up the massage on my own insurance will only pay for 25 visits a year so they want to stop and get the taxotere out of my system before i start up again unless my arms swell a lot then i will go back my sleeves have not arrived there is search for them going on right now or what has happened to them i really want to go back for my last chemo on friday even though my mind says it the last one i haven recovered from the last infusion feeling so tired but blood test all say good just the taxotere told the onc that yesterday she just gave me a big hug and said she will stop by the chemo lounge on friday to see me trying to figure out what to do for the gals in the lounge on friday after watching them over these last few months they seem to eat the stuff people bring to them they pass it out to all the patients so kinda at a loss as to what to do food seem to be the way i have always showed my appreciation to people maybe stop and get some sherries berries they are not home made any suggestions i cant seem to think of anything lenn 13ka please do tell me what your ro and mo say i would also like to know if it is rads or tamoxifen kind of worried it is the tamoxifen and this could go on for another 5 years the fatigue has gotten so bad that if i do anything weed the garden workout etc i do anyting for a couple of days after my boss actually sent me home from work the friday before last because i looked so exhausted i see my ro in 2 weeks but i see my mo for another month lw0919 my skin started breaking down early too my thoughts are with you i just had my first ac today it wasdose dense adriamycin cytoxan during the infusion even before the adriamycin or cytoxan were administered i started feeling light headed and a little dizzy it continued to slowly get worse over the rest of the infusion time on the drive home i developed a headache behind my eyes the chemo nurse said she really heard of that as a side effect so suggested i take a lorazepam when i got home in case it was anxiety related after i took it i read the side effects sheet and realized thatlorazepam can cause dizziness and lightheadedness still experiencing that but maybe now from the drug about an hour after the lorazepam i felt the first twinges of nausea i took one of the pills right away prochlorperazine 10mg and tried to take a nap i dozed off and on for a couple hours but woke up still feeling the same the nausea is worse and the headache is still there i just took two tylenol for the headache and am waiting for them to kick in been drinking tons of water 5 24oz bottles so far today and i had hydration in my iv i think it can be dehydration related anyone else experience anything like this ellebee good to hear that almost done with thee first phase i wonder what the docrors use to figure out which course of chemo they choose for us i know pretty standard to give chemo if in the lymph nodes i guess our er pr and her 2 status also plays a role i think i just answered my own question i had last thursday which was my second taxol i spent the entire weekend glued to the couch between tiredness and bone pain today was the first day of school for students and it too bad i had some pain but advil helped and the exhaustion feeling is typical for the first day i hope everyone else is doing well jkcrml i drink wine while getting herceptin nobody told me not to i firmly beleive that it keeps me from strangling anyone who gets in my path kaidog i kill the hubby i need his health i know i should excercise for many reasons my weight being a big one but i stay so exhausted from lack of sleep i just get motivated bold i had before bc started having some hot flashes at least i thought that was hot ha and symptoms i am 45 that was nothing compared to tamox throwing me instantly into menapuase good luck on your research regarding a and being only 2 it really sucks that we have to rely on ourselves for this type of research and not our dearly paid docs cakelady my doc had me start the tamox 3 weeks after the last tch a bit of advice when the doc hands you the script for tamox ask for a script of effexor to go with it if you are heat intolerant already you are gonna need it i just had another sleepless night so i guess my bitch factor is up i need another cup o joe before i sart the day my students were in high drama mode yesterday i suggest they try that again today lisa holli sorry to hear this i hope your mom others are being helpful with your kiddos and that they are not too freaked by this i remember your mom being less than perfectly helpful in the past and hope that you have the support you need right now sending healing thoughts your way djj i love it superwoman i started tamoxifen yet but coming my bc was only weakly hormone 15 er 5 pr and this is only what was known from the core biopsy since there enough cancer left to test at time of surgery apparently any amount of positive counts as positive my docs are not in a rush to get me on tam same reaction as with surgery and rads no big rush as long as getting herceptin all my docs agree on that been trying to get on track losing weight before the tam starts lost all the weight i gained with chemo plus a tiny bit more so hard every little bit counts i guess very slow going worries that starting tam is going to set me back there is a blog that read from time to time by a lady whose her 2 bc returned as mets i check it constantly but checked yesterday and saw a post from a little while ago her big goal was to make it until her graduation well her son graduated as valedictorian of his class and she was not only there she is miraculously ned she continues on herceptin perjeta for now her story was too good not to share hello everyone i was asked to participate in a study that reduces chemo brain and neuropathy from taxol it is called a randomized placebo controlled trial of for the prevention of taxane induced neuropathy phase iii i am going to turn them down but i am going to start taking in the dosage prescribed on web md i am starting taxol december 23 and i too am praying that it is easier than ac i had my last ac on thursday and i am still sick as a dog mostly just queasy and tired lago i have the heartburn too the prilosuck works for me but i am scared to go past the 14 days i forgot to ask my onc if i could restart another 14 day period oh well hope everyone is having a somewhat happy holiday the lights and trees make me smile and cry too hey gang hope my fabulous furry friends sisters are doing ok now knock on wood my from ac too bad just fatigue and queasy but now that been given a benadryl and have 1 taxol treatment in me feeling more fatigue dull muscle ache slightly arthritic on taxol more than the ac anyone feeling pain achy etc if possible get your feet up and take an advil or tylenol this has worked for me so far hugs poor celine i hear what you are saying about being different it sucks i seem to keep being unlucky as well as i am in the small percentage of people that certain treatments help first it was tamoxifen 2 months of that and stop because not working then 2 ac and 3 fac stop that because its not working now taxol only had 1 cycle so far so too soon to see if working but its enough to make me keep worrying all the time because i know how many more options there are if this one fails or how much worse the side effects are with each new drug sorry to hear you are having such an awful time with taxol so far it has been easier on me than the others except i have neuropathy in my fingers now which makes so many things so hard to do i agree totally tho fuck cancer how high was your calcium mine was one point higher than normal and the dr said that is trivial and indicates nothing i hope right i had a lot of abnormal chemistries protein in my urine high glucose high cholesterol live enzyme a bit high it was almost reassuring to see in black and white why i feel this way as for fatigue in the breast cancer for idiots book it says that a percentage of bc survivors never feel the same again after chemo something to think about before deciding well i thought and thought but what is the choice excercize definitely is helping me and being off of arrimidex helps i started very slowly only doing 20 minutes at 2 mph on the treadmill originally that was enough to elevate my pulse by 30 points yesterday i did 30 minutes and my pulse went up much less so i assume something good is happening a long road but most important thank god for the good mammo celebrate in the beginning my husband came with me to every app and was so concerned at this point i go to everything alone and he even know i take this as progress the apps are routine and all getting more and more relaxed about them a good thing hi ktam 96 one of the people who have little to no from femara i have been on it since october last year and other than a sleep issue to start and hot flashes that continue i feel great i take the little pill at night so that takes care of the sleep problem for me and over the time the flashes are becoming less in number intensity and duration i also take some supps and believe that they help as well always keep in mind with all of these meds that you have a choice of others should you find this one too difficult but please give yourself a good few months before you make any decision to either change or stop love n hugs chrissy dear dammie glutamine has been tried to treat various types of treatment induced side effects including prevention of peripheral neuropathy associated with taxol whether it will be helpful in this situation there is not enough data to predict as regards to toxicity or serious side effects of glutamine there are none reported the dose suggested is within the dosage range that has been reported allergic reaction to taxol is almost always seen within the first hour of infusion as taxol would be out of your system a week after treatment what you are experiencing is unlikely an allergic reaction itching and rash are very rare side effects of taxol reported in less than 1 of the patients during clinical trials if this reaction is an effect of taxol it is likely the further from treatment it will subside regarding your concerns with anesthesiology discussing your concern with the surgeon and or anesthesiologist would be most appropriate rabbit cease and desist quit reading stuff that scares the he l out of you unless it is relevant to your situation feeding a monster if you keep feeding it it will get big and fat checking up on people who have been diagnosed or who are just worried is like heading back into your past like stalking your creepy new girlfriend to see how faring in your old shoes just and the reason being so emphatic is that i did it too and then i stopped because it was going in the wrong direction rocky m is right rent beaches or for a good cry and a good laugh and a new love of life rent the intouchables mbf on a more cosmetic note i felt a billion times better one my eyelashes grew back in i was menopausal 10 lbs over my regular weight crabby and sweaty with my hair but once my eyelashes came back i felt like a girl again when they first came back i was so excited that i kept checking myself in the reat view mirror all impatient and waiting for our identity to be returned to you is really hard been 9 months since chemo 5 since radiation and feeling pretty good my hair is kind of cute and dyed my eyelashes are back and i wear blouses instead of to hide my belly most days i feel pretty good except for the occasional days where thanks to tamoxifen and menopause i turn into a total b tch janet lovelyface i would want it out also sorry going through this please keep us posted bak i hope what the bs did today does the trick i hate all the worrying associated with this awful disese scans make me crazy too i was thinking today my last ct scan was in october susan i actually popped back on here tonight because i had the same thought about the chemo possibly causing your problems i was wiped out physically from tac but halaven has had a number of relatively minor but still significantside effects to date i have had a buzzing sensation in my left foot sharp but fleetingpins and needle painin both hands and arms cycle 3 brought increased numbness in my left hand original numbness began unilaterally with tac in index finger cotton like feeling in my feet but particularly the left that lasted for a couple days after cycle 3 and it has made me stupid i remember how to spell words when writingi put the wrong word in place of a word and i cannot focus on more than one thing at a time my dh tells me i repeat myself all of this stuff except for the chemo brain comes and goes for the most part butbased on my experience it seems likely to methat your symptoms could be from the chemo i wanted to let you know this particularly because i know that most people have problems with neuropathybilaterally but that been the case for me if you getting the feedback from your finger to your brain then it would make sense for you to think on the right key but not hope this makes sense anyway passing this along and hope your road trip goes well actually some of my best memories as a child were long road trips the family interaction in the car was very special to me laurajane i was drifting right along in that dream i am going to make a note of the today show and try to watch by the way a thread on the site with links to many of the recent vaccine developments the thread is called promising vaccines under tnbc talk goodnight everyone hi cathy my diagnosis is very similar to yours except that i was highly er my her 2 neu was borderline so they are treating me as if it was positive i had 4 ac then 4 taxol i started herceptin with the taxol and will have it for a year total my onc said they are moving away from the anthricyclines sp but many doctors are reluctant to eliminate a tx i had a really strong muga so that concerned about heart problems for me i feel more comfortable knowing that i have had all the tx i could i would hate to have a recurrence and then feel like i could have avoided it if had more tx but a personal decision ac was bad but so was in a different way herceptin is a a runny nose for a few days after on a 3 wk cycle now that chemo has ended if you already find a group on here that is starting chemo at the same time as you are the june 2007 group is really what got me through it good luck to you cyndi blownaway it can take a really long time for the neuropathy to get better from what i have read give up hope i ll keep my fingers crossed for you elaine yes that does make me feel better i have taxol 9 tomorrow well if blood work holds up sheesh so we shall see what the neuropathy does hoping your pet goes well todaynancy peggy i started lupron when i was 41 it was definitely menopause i know whether worse than natural menopause my endocrinologist friends seem to know either i think each individual reaction to oophs is a lot like their individual reaction to natural menopause some suffer some slide through i was somewhere on the lighter side the actual ooph was last year i got tired of the shots i noticed an increase in hot flashes but they have since subsided to the normal level when i asked the surgeon about it he said other women had complained about the same the ovaries just make estrogen but some amount of other hormones as well this probably much help to you but the answer really is you will react however you react i have been on herceptin since december 2003 and i say that i have had any more colds than anyone else probably fewer if anything i do have the flu jab as a precaution ring your surgery if you are interested but i have found that any bacterial infections do seem to get a hold on me and as i said in my previous entry i had a strep infection over the summer and i ended up with 3 courses of antibiotics to shift it the last course was 10 days instead of the usual 7 and that did the trick which must say something about the state of our immune system i am really well get much in the way of tiredness after treatment but i do try to take it easy for the day or so after treatment it does sound as if if you have a bad cold or sore throat you will need help to get rid of it good health to you all blondie jahaage i had a similar experience a dramatic difference with the first few rounds of thp but just stability after that tempting to want more but the doctor and others constantly remind me that stable is good and that we can remain stable for a very long time on these therapies it is a marathon not a sprint so i think stopping when you started noticing neuropathy was a good choice i admire that you can still play tennis my doctor let me do anything except for swimming cycling and walking because of the spinal mets and walking is the only one i manage to actually do congrats on the clear scans kjones yay i hope they can figure out your issue with breathing and fatigue ronnie glad to hear you are still doing well after dropping the p sorry to hear you hurt your arms but sounds like you were having a good time i agree with the unsettledness which i think is the perfect way to describe it last week a dear friend of mine just found out that her stage iv anal cancer has metastasized again after 5 years of ned beginning to feel like a jinx as so many of my friends are struggling with serious health issues suddenly so sorry about your cousin by the way i too recognized revival of we care with a small smile of remembrance someone in another forum posted the squirrel the other day and i had to refrain from saying squirrel the little things we miss so much tx looking forward to that last round of taxotere for you i stopped mine at the end of december 2014 it was nice to start the new year off without it 2nd i see you deleted your post but i wanted you to know you are in my thoughts minnie i buzzed my hair very short about a week after starting taxotere it was my first chemo i lost a ton of hair right after the second treatment but what was left pretty much stayed and continued to grow albeit slowly be sure to tell your doctor about the headaches i had the bone pain mainly in the hips and still get it when i get my xgeva shot i tended towards constipation with a little diarrhea thrown in for a change now and then hard to know what to expect each round of taxotere was different for me with different ses getting my hair cut back into a pixie today i have been wrestling with it lately and was debating on whether or not to let it grow into a bob but finding out that i might go back on the taxotere in a few months plus hat season coming up has made me think short is better this is the first time in my life that had short hair and i have to admit i kind of like it so sorry you had to miss rads today kathy but at least glad you have some strong boys to help you get dug out hopefully your husband was able to get home today and all have a good weekend together terri sure hope the se are winding down by now sue i had my first taxotere infusion on nov 22 and had a worse time with the se than from the a c however some of the problems may have come from the perjeta so sure try to find out as much as i can when i see my mo this wednesday to let you know i have any problems at all with allergic reaction or breathing which i think they were really concerned about with the taxotere i also had any neuropathy although that may come with additional treatments of course except for a tingle on the soles of my feet every day or so if i thinking about it i probably even notice it sure be praying for you over the next weeks with all you have coming up great news for me although you all are the only ones who can understand it last night i saw some little white peach fuzz on the top of my head been trying not to get discouraged after the a c treatments are finished since the taxotere causes hair loss but i know some of the ladies said started to see the little fuzz before the second taxotere been praying that be patient but also that god would give me some hair so i help but be cheered up a bit still be wearing the wig for a long time but a start well out to cover my citrus trees yep the cold snap even made it to houston i know the rest of the country has it much worse so not really complaining god bless you all so glad here bev heiditoo i am also like you i am a perfectionist by nature so not having my questions answered is frustrating very frustrating but i am not depressed about all of this anymore i have a oh well attitude too right now i just want my hair back i am shiny bald as my last taxol was 14 days back i am just waiting for the damn thing to show a tiny little growth but it is not showing yet and tomorrow i have to deal with the fact that my med onc wants to prescribe aridimex and zometa to me zometa is for bone loss which is caused by aridimex i am tn with 2 progesterone positive i am wondering if any of you took any hormonal drug and something like zometa which seems to be a serious drug given by infusion to people who have bone metastasis i have any metastasis or node positive at this time any taking any of these medications please do tell me about it will this make money for my med onc he never explains anything to me nothing for instance what would be my risks versus benefits i hate having to make these types of decisions i am like a guinea pig i never used to take any prescription medication and now all this i hate side effects i know what the hell to do taxotere vs a ci am new to this conversation can anyone advise i was diagnosed stage ii invasive duct breast carcinoma i am a triple negative i am doing chemotherapy i started treatment 08 i am taking taxotere and 2 study medications gemzar and avastin so far i can tell you that taxotere is rugged hair loss was nothing compared to the palmar and plantar erythroparathenesis something i like to call second degree burns on my palms and soles of my feet my fingertips have regenerated 4 times now the blisters and burning is unreal if i had special powers it would be to throw fire it was soo disabling i couldnt even open a plastic bag or lift the toilet seat aside from the hair loss other side effects caused was the ridges dark spots tender and painful misshapen nails and my toe nails are lifting off the beds i do have major gastrointestinal distress bloating and the overall sick nasty chemical feeling which includes a strange sensation of the tongue and taste but after 9 chemo treatments and half way i am now switching to a c and avastin my onc tells me that a c is a lot easier but i hear it is very very nauseating i have much nausea until my last month on the taxotere and others but the nausea is so not like just waves of flu like symptoms its that unreal off feeling that you have like you just drank some and it ran through all your tissues and left your with that weird burny chemical motion sick feeling with acid building in your stomach and bowels so does anyone have some imput on what to expect with the a c is it the same old flame throwing diarreah and chemical sick nausea taxotere cuts into your aerobic capacity and just vaccuming and walking around and doing errands wears you out how does the a c measure up patin your theory comes very timely for me i just finished ac every two weeks and am due to start taxol this friday i tolerated ac fairly well though it has taken a toll on my poor body i came down with shingles this weekend my doctor has left it up to me as to wether i will do taxol weekly for 12 weeks or every other week for 8 she has given me the pros and cons i am absolutely agonizing over this decision and have to decide by friday i keep changing my mind i just want her to tell me what to do i realize that all of you here did weekly did your doctors just flat out tell you that was better now that i hear your theory i am leaning back to every two weeks i keep flip flopping and i have read such different accounts here of the weekly taxol i think you could be on to something i have been told by doc that the big problem with the weekly is the neuropathy but i am reading of much more than that here so i look forward to seeing if others here agree with your theory i am happy to be done with the ac but now i realize if i do weekly taxol i am not even halfway done been on esd estrogen sucking drug anastrozole for 13 months now i stiffen up when i move but can walk most of it out in about a minute i will admit i try to power walk 40 minutes a day and strength train for minutes a day i have a feeling i would be much stiffer if i my hot flashes are so minor that not even sure they are flashes usually between am when eaten something spicy that evening hard to believe i went through chemopause and having such an easy time with the flashes the update on me if any really wants to read all this saw my onc np yesterday seems one of those liver lesions has gone away the other 2 they are assuming are cysts and unchanged but still too small to tell my onc now wants me to have another scan in 6 months wft i asked why so soon the other was 1 year she stated i was further out from treatment also now they give me the results over the phone or email i have to come in due to hippa law says the scheduler at least i can do that on the same day i was told my eyebrows thinning are not from the esd estrogen sucking drug anastrozole not sure what to do about the nails that are still lifted either not sure if going to see a dermatologist about these issues yet but my onc gave me the name of the super special dermatologist trying to cut down on doctors visits not add them so my np says i only have to keep the port 2 years not 3 she was going to check with my onc forgot to get that answer i figure when i do the liver scan i can find out the liver scan visit will be 1 month shy of 2 years having the port i might be getting deported sooner rather than later rj great news on path report all great prognostic indicators regarding to chemo or not to chemo by all means gather more information until you feel comfortable with the ultimate decision we found it helpful to get a second opinion from an oncologist at a different institution we ended up staying with the original doc even though we liked the second one better on a personal level but it was reassuring to get another thoughts and know that she thought that the treatment plan was appropriate i felt like it was a good idea to go to a different institution to be sure that we would get an independent second opinion all these appointments are exhausting but it felt very worth it to me it also means that we have another oncologist that interviewed and know we like to turn to should we not be happy with the care that kathleen is getting at the current institution another thing that really helped me in this process was seeing the recurrence statistics for the different treatment options and the incremental benefit of each additional modality the oncologist should be able to provide you with these figures some know the approximate numbers off the top of their heads but for more exact figures they plug a info age histology size nodes hormone receptor status etc into a software program adjuvant and it spits out the statistics these are only general population probabilities but i found them very helpful for situation the probability of a relapse within 10 years without additional treatment i think this includes radiation forgot to ask is adding chemotherapy lowers that probability to a for us anyway the program allows one to compare no adjuvant treatment to hormonal only or to the combination of hormonal plus chemotherapy etc once you know the added benefit of chemo it then becomes a very personal decision but it is one that you should be allowed to make glad that the chemo question was in case a benefit of is more of a struggle bearing in mind the rigors of chemo and the risks of cardiac injury and leukemia one caveat is that i think the software accounts for histology lobular vs ductal it seems to me that there is some suggestion that lobular tumors tend to be less aggressive and i wonder if the chemo benefit is less than for ductal might be something that you want to ask and if i get a moment look through the literature to see if anything written about it one more thing have any of doctors suggested genetic testing for the brca genes depending on how extensive family history is and at what ages her relatives were diagnosed genetic testing might be indicated my uderstanding is that women with brca mutations are at higher risk than women without so that could help with any treatment decisions okay enough on that topic and on to others our appointments on monday were long and many very exhausting and a bit overwhelming it was the hardest day for me since the surgery i got most of my questions answered but was disconcerted to find out that kathleen will go on zoladex immediately to shut down her ovaries my initial understanding was that she would wait until after chemo for the ovarian ablation and i thought i had months to research this and think about it unfortunately the oncologist forgot to mention it in our meeting and we found out from the clinical nurse so have a chance to question the oncologist about it kathleen seems okay with it so trying to relax about it after all it is her body i wish that i had had the chance to ask the oncologist about the difference in benefit between tamoxifen and ovarian ablation ai so i could feel better about it in postmenopausal women the benefit of ais over tamoxifen is pretty impressive but i been able to find any studies of ovarian ablation and ai in women if the benefit is small i know whether kathleen would still want to endure premature menopause on the other hand she seems content to go along with what the oncologist says so i know whether i should leave well enough alone or bring this issue up again with her i want to respect her ability to make decisions but i also feel that i do have some responsibility to make sure that she has all the necessary bits to make an informed decision have to think about this some more the oncologist gave kathleen a prescriptions or so most for meds for the meds i think she will have to get a pillminder to keep track of all of them instead of cytoxan by infusion she takes 2 pills daily by mouth in addition she takes a heartburn medication daily coumadin to keep her port from clotting an antibiotic on days 3 4 to prevent pneumocystis pneumonia a daily injection of neupogen that she administers herself ick and compazine to use as needed mel i was surprised by this and even asked the nurse or was it the oncologist about this i said she take it as a precaution before she needs it and the nurse said no from what read on the boards it seems that most doctors recommend that patients take the drugs on a schedule before they feel nauseated kathleen will get decadron and zofran in her infusion which should last about 24 hours but after that compazine prn i know maybe the weekly chemo is a low enough dose that the as needed works see i found this part of the visit overwhelming all the meds and information overload then we went up to get a tour of the oncology clinic where kathleen will be getting her infusion when i really fell apart though not visibly i know exactly what triggered it all we saw was rooms with beds or chairs and the nurses it like there were lots of patients around maybe the actual physical space just made it more real for me i had to fight back tears as we walked through this is the hard part for me when i feel emotional and kathleen is feeling fine i feel like not okay for me to show that scared or sad because i want to be as positive as possible for her luckily i have a good personal support network where i can talk about my own feelings and not that i ever share my feelings with her been sad together but really hard to keep it together all the time i especially want to express my feelings when feeling so positive which she does 95 of the time can anyone relate as for mention of festival that brought back memories for me too distant ones though i been since the early 80 s okay gone on and on i guess i have a lot on my mind these days thankful for this forum and all your thoughts and encouragement rj i hope the went well and was painless linda my thoughts will be with you and kerri on friday mel thanks for your support post when i can and let you know how it all went take care wintersocks i had soreness of my ribs last year also it kind of resolved but was on and off for a few months i also experienced the air bubble feeling at times the closest i got about the rib pain was that i believe it had something to do with tamoxifen throughout the last year had joint pain times lasting only a few days but once there it has been really bad and impossible to ignore costocondritis was another possibility but never know for sure what calmed me down was that it seemed to be related to muscle soft tissue when i pressed hard on my ribs there was no increased sharp pain it always got better when i was more stretched it felt like it had been started off by me sitting and the ribs pressing down on my abdomen sounds crazy tammy i hat act 6 years ago cutting your hair into a bob is a good idea i got a pixie and when it started to fall out my husband shaved it he shaves his own head i wish i had gone to a professional for the shave it would have been a closer shave i always had a bit of stubble right above my neck in the back i had great drugs kytril and emend two days after chemo my stomach was off but never enough to get sick i stuck to water and toast those days i had one taxol treatment and had an allergic response at the 2nd so i was switched to taxotere they are similar but i understand taxol is a little easier to handle re ses muscle bone pain was bad for 1 to days each treatment i stayed on the couch otherwise okay i had no stomach sensitivity on that my brows stayed in until taxotere was almost finished and that helped appearance wise dusting a little eyeshadow the color of your hair onto your brows helps give a frame to the face and is more subtle than an eyebrow pencil my hair was already started to come back while on taxotere overall the fatigue of chemo is cumulative i was beat by the end and did throw up once i was feeling okay and commuted to the office about hrs on public transportation and got sick when i arrived turned around and went home by car service so try to take it easier as it progresses i highly recommend the port why they want to give you one i had one and will be getting one this time around as well it was a very short procedure that you stay away for but sedated i have a wig i went for similar color but long and wavy and sexy i need to dig it out i may restyle into a shorter style to keep things simple this time around i had days i keep it on my head because it bothered me but it worked when i had meetings or when i went to a big bash during treatment i keep scarves on my head they slipped off i wore some hats but i have a big head lol and it was hard to find comfortable ones that fit not a fan of baseball caps i wore a velvet turban at home in winter when it was cold and used to walk around saying ready for my close up mr demille a nice handknit watch cap hat at the office and just went bald in summer my office is casual and i could get away with that best to everyone zogo hope you get some satisfaction with the skin graft area thinkingof you annie hi ladies i am sorry to read about so many of you having abdominal pain i know that i have a lot of constipation and gas after my taxol but i think the constipation is from the pain meds i had the terrible lower body and some upper pain last round i have been feeling pretty good the last couple of days and have been more active even got to the grocery store kids were at camp all week which helped but today we have to drive down and pick them up sure as soon as they get in the car the whining about hungry will start we have a 14 year old who is insatiable anyhow hope everyone has a good weekend merilee keep us up to date on your rads glad they are going ok so far been on avastin along with abraxane since feb and zometa since january had any major side effects from the chemo other than losing my hair again and being tired some bone pain but that is managed with vicodin my blood pressure already years ago is controlled with lisinopril hct and i had any nosebleeds all my blood counts have stayed high enough that i needed any shots though my rbcs are low which is why so tired prior to starting on avastin abraxane i was in excruciating incapacitating pain but it is completely gone now going to be having scans done in june and hope to learn that the drugs have been doing their job i had aloxi in my infusion also not sure how long it lasts i only had taxol too and the onc said much less issue with nausea i did get kind of queasy off and on but as i mentioned earlier i would take the sublingual zofran an it worked great bikenyc i am on cytoxan taxol and the taxol has given me neuropathy i started on the glutamine powder about 2 weeks ago at 10 grams the can says five but be sure to follow whatever you were told 3 times a day i still have tingling numbness though maybe if you are starting right when the taxol begins you will have good results i hate to think what mine would be like if i take it they also added neurontin which is actually an drug that is a common therapy for restless leg syndrome so it is hard for me to tell at this point what is actually helping since i am still symptomatic they classify me as a grade 1 at chemo which means i guess that it is mostly under control with meds supplement if it gets to a grade 3 affecting daily living like unable to button write type stumble etc then they will reduce or stop the taxol i keep a daily diary of temp what time i take pills how many constipation diahrrea issues weight and any i have throughout the day you might want to consider something similar it was very easy to go back and say what days i had tingling or aching sore muscles neulasta shot related hard to remember all that stuff over two time you can start to see a pattern of peak days both good and bad you could add things like nausea headache heartburn etc i have developed such a chemo brain that i would not make it through the day without the notebook there are times i remember if i took a drug or not and have to go back and look i was so afraid take too much of something or skip something so i am really trying to stay on top of that be interested in what others are doing for neuropathy i am somewhat limited because of the clinical trial i am on so there are just a few things they will let me try but i have suggested things before like taking only half of the shot this week and they agreed eliminate it but was able to reduce it now hoping my bloodwork shows that was a good idea when they check again friday britt hugs i had isolated tumour cells in two nodes but considered node negative onco 6 no chemo started tamoxifen in feb 09 and within a few weeks had horrible anxiety then depression and get out of bed went off tam straight away and then when feeling better saw my onc he suggested trying again and i suggested splitting the dose i had 2 weeks off and started taking it again during a good period of my cycle b4 i started taking it right when my period was due thinking it would stop it noooooo anyway coming up to 9 weeks down the track 2nd time around and i feel great bit of anxiety but i had that with premenstrual tension anyway i have no major side fx at all other than dry eyes there is another lady on the bottle o tamoxifen thread who also splits the dosage like me and doing well i am totally surprised at how better i feel so thought i would post just to let you hear my story can you try again and see if it works better big hugshelena jdg i have had the neuropathy of the fingernails and toenails too it started about the 14th week of weekly adriamycin and just continued to get worse through these past 11 weeks of taxol i felt like i had 10 ingrown toenails and the fingertips and nails were extremely sensitive and painful the nails discolored then new nails were growing underneath the pain went away and the nails started falling off i have one toenail to lose and four fingernails now both the old and new fell off lol now i am experiencing the numbness and tingling in my fingertips i did put a picture of what this looked like when it started on my blog the picture is on september 13 2007 on day 122 my little daily contribution to life in treatment with bc i had six taxol treatments and stopped them because of neuropathy in fingers and feet then had two taxotere the last treatment was april 20 2010 and i still have problems with my feet my oncology nurse said the window of recovery is anywhere from months after therapy if it happens at all i am still hopefull however the feet really bother me i also learned about the oncotype test from this board and my story may be of interest to you first of all you need to learn about different chemotherapy regimens rather than simplytrusting an oncologist all of the widely used regimensseem to work for idc to some degree but they have different side effects the a of ac is adriamycin which is quite effective but involves a chance of your developing congestive heart failure which may not show upuntil years after the treatment i did research on chemo and found out about adriamycin which also tends to be ineffectiveagainst classic ilc the type of bc i had however after surgery i was referred to an oncologist who immediately declared that i should have ac plus t because of sentinel node involvement i absolutely refused to do ac partly because there is a family history of cardiovasculardisease on my side i requested another oncologist andalso asked to take the oncotype dx test which no one had mentioned partly because it had only recently been extended to include some node positives i offered to pay for it if necessary since my hmo cover it yet but genomic is appealing i had already decided to try tc chemo if my score was intermediate or high but it came back 16 and the graph for node positives indicated zero chemo benefit for that score i then wrote a polite letter to my bs and onc 2 advising them that i saw no point in spending over three months on a treatment that offered no likely benefit i am now finishing a 30 rad regimen and will follow that with an a i i have a fair amount of confidence in the oncotype test while hesitate to make a decision entirely on the basis of a low score i think probably more reliable than categorical distinctionsbased ontumor size sentinel node involvement etc in my case the oncotype score seemed to reinforce other information collected about ilc and chemotherapy and it tipped the scales decisively in the direction of bypassing chemo mrscich good to see you here good luck with the surgeries and tamoxifen i have been on tamoxifen for months and have not had any real ses i started taking it at night and had a bit of insomnia so i switched to the morning the odd warm flush and an occasional ache but i do have arthritis so how do you know what i have been walking each day for a half hour and i think it does help to keep active and the odd advil sherry i just finished my last chemo of taxotere and cytoxin yeah the taxotere can cause bone pain and muscle aches i did have that compounded by the nuelasta injection each day following the chemo the neulasta was pretty bad the first time but not so with the last 3 injections with the taxotere for the first 20 minutes the onco nurse never left my side due to possbile side effects and they also administered benadryl along with the anti nausea meds before the taxotere for about 20 minutes and then they waited a good 15 before starting the taxotere to let them take effect taxotere is derived from the yew tree they told me it is in a thick glass bottle encased in plastic while all the other drugs were in plastic iv bags powerful stuff they said i never had the first wave of nausea i was so lucky but they really loaded me up on anti nausea meds which i started at home the day before and continued for 5 days afterwards also my oncologist prescribed vicodin for the pain said he even mess around with ibuprofen or advil said there was no reason what so ever to suffer pain i agree the thing i hated most was losing my taste buds for about a week after each infusion may as well been eating a plate of alpo but they return quickly and then i chow down i wish you well and remember we are all different in our reactions to these meds nancy i have been on arimidex for six years after complaining to my oncologist about head aches joint pains and dry eyes he finally has taken me off it i think five years is the cut off point i am hoping all these side effects will go away anyone have any info on the long term effects of arimidex i was on on tamoxifen for 2 years before the arimidex today is only day 8 of tamoxifen for me and having a heck of a time trying to figure out whether or not what experiencing is a tamoxifen side effect or not how in the world do you tell the difference when symptoms could be due to anything e g been having rib pain is it a radiation side effect or caused by the new mattress been sleeping on since approximately the same time radiation ended who really knows today my emotional state i basically freaked out on my therapist i was talking about a difficult relationship problem been having this week halfway through the appointment i just bear to keep talking anymore and burst out with a rant about how sick of being emotional sick of crying sick of endlessly processing my emotions and just going round and round in circles and stupid and i just want to go back to bed so i have to deal with it all and i know if i was upset due to the relationship problem i was talking about or if actually the tamoxifen throwing me out of whack like this it felt like major pms or depression the desire to just shut my freaking brain off and go back to bed i like this a week ago before tamoxifen started so like to say the tamoxifen but i also experiencing this particular relationship problem a week ago either so it feels impossible to ever be able to say oh the tamoxifen when there are other variables in my life continually changing as well that can never be controlled for really frustrating hi to all i too was afraid to start the tamoxifen certainly i did not need to gain weight and the prospect of the uterine cancer also scares me i have been on it now for two weeks and have experienced mild hot flashes during the day and a few night sweats i have not had a period since i started chemo in sept i miss them my appetite has not increased but i am being very careful about my eating right now just in case mybc was only 15 for er and 40 pr and i wonder how effective it is for my type of cancer i also seem to find any dr who can explain the progesterone part and how it relates to the estrogen i wonder if in the future there will be drugs that are more effective for pr cancers hello i recently had surgery modified radical mastectomy on august 20th and post operative complications my incision opened up in three different areas about 11 days after surgery i am still trying to stop bleeding as i write this the grand news is they removed 11 lymph nodes and all were clear so i am considered cured unless there is a recurrence in the other breast at a later date my oncologistsuggested a harmone inhibitor such as tamoxifen but left the decision entirely up to me i asked the sideeffects and he said blood clots stroke joint pain headaches he said it was all right with himto not take any harmonemedication at all i am age 63 and post menopausal never experienced anyaffects going through menopause and decided the side effects were not worth taking this medication my tumor was high estrogen positive idc the tumorwas caught early and removed i feel so lucky to be in this position the oncologist did say there is a 30 less chance of recurrence if taking drugs such as tamoxifen so my decision not to take the medication was perfectly ok with my doctor and feel it was the right choice in my instance i have read quite a bit about what people are going through in taking these medications and sounded to me justsomething i did not want to deal with i will monitor with proper check ups and mammograms as needed and i will post time to time to report my progress or recurrence if it happens good luck to you all going through this terrible disease and may god bless you in the fight and bring healing to your body i had one taxol when onc switched me due to severe neuropathy right out of the gate then three taxotere doses i suffered greatly through both and hated each of them with a passion my bone and muscle pain was so severe i had to be put on pain pills which i take as i was still working full time just reading your posts on taxol and taxotere takes me right back there to a time i will never forget god speed and may your journey be as easy as possible i did live through it all and now am glad i stuck it out as i so often threatened to quit edited to add to those who have not yet began their taxol or taxotere please know that it effects everyone differently i know so many gals that had no trouble with it at all lisa i was on the perjeta combo for four months i had progression in nov so moved to a different chemo my side effects from taxotere and perjeta which included constant tearing and diarrhea improved after weeks i still have fatigue and neuropathy but since i am still on chemo tdm 1 the side effects may have continued but overall i felt better in a few weeks congratulations on the remission and i hope you feel better soon hi all i had my 5th dose of taxol and herceptin today they lowered my benadryl and dex i am still very tired but feel a little more alert today i had something odd happen today however i thought i started feeling a little short of breath with very mild chest or was it just my midback discomfort it was after the herceptin benadryl and dex and during the taxol i was just lying on the couch and thinking that i still had a little shortness of breath could this just be back pain and tiredness anyone else feel this way during or after treatment oh something else strange that started last night and is there again today my scalp hurts i have only peach fuzz having lost my hair a long time ago during the ac there is really not much else to lose but it hurts like it did before my hair fell out i have heard of people having hair grow back in during taxol not fall out completely all of a sudden after several treatments cathie tina 2 still having pain with my injections the hip pain after shots is relieved for me with lyrica volteran cream and lmxcream rubbed all over right after they give the injections i actually do the lmx cream fifteen minutes before while doind chemo tomorrows discussion after pet scan will be are these working because i believe my bone mets have moved into my right arm and shoulder i imagine having the faslodex shots in my right hip after the bone marrow surgery i have a painful lower back with everything i do since i started these shots i use to be able to walk five miles a day now i walk half a block and the lower back pain sets in big time that it stops me in my steps if you have arthritis and are stage iv i would discuss with your rheumatologist to talk with oncologist about adding cytoxan i would not be able to do the faslodex shots without cytoxan i only have lower back pain and pain where there is cancer in the bone but the swelling and joint pain feet swelling pain also gone since doctors put me on cytoxan if my blood levels are down and they give cytoxan they also wait to give me my faslodex knowing what happens to me from them i have found that women who have arthritis or other soft tissue and bone diseases seem to have much more pain than those who my doctors say that it causes flairs with arthritis and important to find a way to ease the situation like i said before all the meds before have helped me to be able to stay on faslodex now if the scans tomorrow show even more cancer and tumor growth they are thinking of changing me out to something else seen how many women have done so well with faslodex and i really want to keep on it hi ladies i will be heading to ash wednesday shortly it has been a busy week for me i just have to give you a praise report i started avastin on friday and today the ascites fluid went down from 6 liters last week to liters this week praise god this drug is working nancy praying for your bil and sister and family this is a difficult time for all and i pray god will bring healing to his body and the kidney stone will be removed kath praying hard for you and that your appt went well and you have peace praying for wisdom for you and your doctors i know about the weight issue very hard to maintain weight

if i mention your name but praying for all heading to church prayers and hugscharlotte hi everyone just like janey i am considering stopping my tamoxifen treatments i am 39 and was diagnosed 31may 07 stage 2 invasive ductal carcimona i had lumpectomy and node removal i had 1 node involved and had to have 3 as my surgeon was not happy with the clear margins around the tumour i had six chemo and then 3 weeks of rads my surgeon told me to stop taking the contraceptive pill on my diagnosis 20 years of use which leads me to think that this had alot to do with it my cancer was hormone receptive i was starting to feel quite healthy again when i started the tamoxifen i had night sweats from day 1 quickly followed by flushes during the day head aches nausea and low libido through lack of sleep i feel terrible i have been taking tamoxifen for 6 weeks and i will continue to take it until i speak to my oncologist black cohosh and evening primrose have been suggested by my gp but otherwise i was told that i would have to put up with it can anyone suggest any herbal remedies the night sweats are my main concern best wishes everyone and keep positive love andrea katie i also am taking tamoxifen and i have experienced a number of eye problems which have been attributed to tamox i have recurring daily problems with blurred vision and i now have mild cataracts so i guess i am one of those dealing with that rare side effect of the drug that just happens to be keeping me stable by the way eye drops have helped some but what helps the most is down time for my eyes my md recommended i start taking a lutein supplement for eye health so now i take lutein and zeaxanthin i hope it will make a difference over the months to come good luck to you hi there yes i had a series of acupuncture for hot flushes as i am on tamoxofen it was offered by my cancer hospital it took a while to work but has reduced the intensity and frequency of my flushes especially at night i now use little mini pads on my legs which have a very very fine needle which activates the right point and that keeps the flushes at bay i also have regular top ups i would say give it a go because it can work successfully and put you out of that misery best of luck although i appreciate and consider opinion i think the day you start tamox will have any type of difference on how cycle or how will manifest themselves if that would be the case i would gladly stop and restart on a better day after my mas i lost 7 10 lbs i then i had rads and when i was done i started tamox i did start to gain weight after i started tamox mainly around my middle but i have stabilized without too much dieting and excercise my are very minimal some warm flushes and night sweats at first definately have the mood swings during the pms part of my cycke and bloating and abdominal pressure other than the heavier and painful periods i can deal just fine on tamox i hope when i have my natural menopause only 45 that i can breeze through it like this except no periods of course i can try and research what day of my cycle it was but i believe that it would make a difference on my experience i believe it is an individual experience based on our chemical reactions to medication and estrogen levels good lucktrish hi everyone i just completed chemo almosta month ago actually my last one was cancelled due to neuropathy i was stageii grade 3 triple neg brca i had a double mastectomy oopherectomy partial breast reconstruction 4 dd a c chemos and 3 dd taxols the pain and neuropathy has worsened in my right shoulder arm and hand i sleep more than couple of hours as it is worse lying down or sleeping why is this getting worse i was told that shoulder pain is a sign that the cancer has spread the oncologist is sending my to physical therapy for a couple of weeks before doing any scans 1 has anyone else had these symptoms worsen after chemo what was the cause resolution 2 does anyone know why it is worse at night when you sleep what can you do ty for your help worried michelel hi i had zoladex and tamoxifen when i was 1st dx in 2003 i was am very er and have since found out pr but her 2 the zoladex will definitely make you menopausal and my onc was sure stay that way after the 2 years as at 41 she thought i was too near my natural menopause to re start having periods well she got that wrong periods came back about months after stopping zoladex even though i was still on tamoxifen it was recommended i had zoladex due to the hormone nature of my bc and the 1st 2 years after dx seem to be the crucial ones the other way to deal with it if you want any children or already have children is to have your ovaries removed by keyhole surgery or having radiotherapy to them so you go into the menopause early at your age this may not be offered as an option as there are risks from osteoporosis and you may not want a permanent menopause you say whether you have had chemo as this may be the reason zoladex being offered i have chemo or whether you are being offered herceptin which i understand is now sometimes offered as a preventative but i could be wrong on this for extra info zoladex brings your oestrogen levels down to those of a post menopausal woman but your body still produces it from other areas noticeably fat therefore the tamoxifen is used to block the receptors as you still have oestrogen in your body hope this makes sense nicky wow 4 weeks and three days after last of 12 taxol and i feel almost myself energy coming back and brain working better had third of 33 rads this morning in at 11 for apt and out at they have you give your name at the desk and go immediately to the dressing room to put on gown was called immediately about 3 minutes for placement and then i put bra and shirt on in machine room and was out the door so much better than waiting 45 min to be called for taxol and then in the chair three and a half to five and a half hours i feel like beginning to get my life back i do gel nails at home from walmart give myself manicures like the shop butl it cost 36 including tips my nails which used to crack and break before gel get long and look good the gel stuff with light last almost three weeks before chipping then i just scrape the stuff off with a thumb nail my thumb nails have verticle ridges and one is dark gray and the other is almost light black like i hit it with a hammer i remember hurting it so blaming it on the taxol actually taxol is my excuse for not doing anything mowed two pastures this afternoon and picked up some limbs and old palm sections to reposition to the burn pile someone dumped them around the edges so weeds can grow up through them it was a mess but i did some work got some exercise and felt good about it taxol is nasty stuff which tires you out and causes aches but hopefully it kills those cancer cells glad over katchya i have been on tamoxifin for over 1 year my diagnosis was much like your 2a with 1 node the next yeatr will go fast the hair will return and enjoy and congrats on finishing chemo i did a c ddxr 4 then taxotere x4 my advice do not worry about the side effects you beat cancer the biggest side effect for me is the weight gain so try and keep it off before you start all i wanted to do was enjoy a meal with out having to worry about it coming back up so hence the weight gain good luck dianne if it for the neuropathy i could do taxol again i only did 6 and it put me into remission for a year so it would still work unfortunately what started the neuropathy in the first place i was actually supposed to do 8 but i stopped at 6 because of the way the numbness was increasing with each tx in a year the numbness never improved it just stayed pretty much the same now getting worse after only 3 having to be careful about walking so i trip plus dropping things a lot i really have no idea what my onc is going to suggest as my next tx actually he suggest he just tells me doing x treatmen starting today there is no discussion or options given guess find out on monday i can hardly wait i can still do gemzar and still xeloda and tykerb plus the super herceptin since already lost about half my hair i now need to wear a hat or scarf hoping for gemzar that way i can get the hair loss over and done with i just wish they could find some way to prevent the nerve damage so many of these chemos cause i can deal with the hair loss but not the nerve loss just noticed this read in active topics and had a brief read i just wanted to tell you that i found the 12 weeks of taxol a breeze i get any se until about week 6 then i noticed mild bone pain on day 3 but well controlled with over the counter analgesia i did get numb finger tips and sore feet but soon went once i finished my only issue with taxol was that my big toe nails lifted and i ended up with an infection under one i ice my nails fingernails were fine the best thing about taxol was no nausea and my hair started growing back so by the end of taxol i had a good inch of thick fluffy hair but it did do a number on my eyebrows ans lashes hang in there girls and believe taxol causes everybody major se i found it easy and managed to work and exercise through it lou hi i know entirely what you are feeling like as i was like that on tamoxifen and was swopped to arimidex and zoladex they seemed a bit better at first but got worse and worse i was soooo exhausted with not sleeping got anxiety attacks bad temper you name it i had it finally got put on low dose prozac after trying loads of natural remedies that help me the difference was instant and i felt loads better immediately after a month i felt much calmer and more settled however from what i gather prozac recommended with tamoxifen but other similar are available my onc just told me had a very strong reaction to all the menopausal type side effects and see what she could try to help me you sound the same if you feel like going to the gp why not contact bcn or onclolgy what i did and it was better as they are dealing with it all the time good luck and hope you get relief soon it really is awful to feel like that and you feel like being soft after chemo etc etc to moan about what is often seen as minor issues two and a half years on and i still cope with crowds for too long or too much noise and activity going on around me i feel the need to escape apparently it is a side effect too so you are not alone liz miss s from the february cruise just a bit before you 3ac down with one more to go i thought mention some ac tips for ac try to chew or suck on ice chips during the adriamycin push this can prevent headaches the headache might also be coming from one of the meds given before the iv some folks get a headache from zofran finally got to keep on top of the constipation meds although found the laxative which was recommended to be too strong now using ducolax a stoll softener good luck to all you march cruisers hillary hi all i was 12 bmx 12 er pr her 2neu starting chemo on thursday my tumor was tiny and clear nodes but i came to realize that this was nothing to mess with i am starting with 3 months of ac every 3 weeks then 3 months of th every week followed by weekly herceptin for 9 months i had the port placed today sore but not in too much pain i am also doing acupuncture strength training and guided meditation to help with nausea and fatigue of chemo there is also research from md anderson that shows regular acupuncture through chemo reduces the occurrence of neuropathy i am giving it a chance thanks for starting this group after reading the posts i feel then support from each of you and want to be part of your group contributing my experience strength and hope as i can i look forward to getting to know you better wishing you health and peace amyq unfortunaly nail changes is one of side effects falling off in some cases you can read more about managing nail changes in our main site hope this helps the mods i have basically the same type and stage breast cancer that you do i have just seen my rad oncologist rads starting next month and he suggested i could also have tamoxifin therapy has anyone had experience with this andy side effects from the tamoxifen etc he talked about weight gain fluid retention more hot flashes all of which i need i am already suffering these problems i am undecided dr said he was fine with or without tamoxefin but i have already had thyroid cancer 10 years ago and family history of breast cancer any comments would be appreciated thanks jaeann hello from ipswich i hear you regarding your weight gain worries but the advice given here is solid you have to gain weight keeping your diet is good but also be sure you are exercising great for weight management along with lots of other goodness been on tamoxifen since last december i reached the 1 year mark post surgeries chemo radiation i do feel like my energy is not completely there yet not sure if the tamoxifen is getting in the way the only other real side effect i can attribute to the tamoxifen and it putting me in this menopausal state 53 so it was happening any how is excessive dryness in my eyes and vaginally when i wake in the morning i need to be very careful opening my eyes good luck and let me know if you want introductions to a local group of great ladies the pink angels in fact in training for the komen 3 day they do lots of walks out of amesbury debbie yesterday i quit taking tamoxifen i have gained 6 lbs in one month and the pain very bad in two days the difference is remarkable i feel a lot better my body is confused but get over that my plan is to follow the advice in the anticancer book keep my weight down exercise eat lots of vegetables learn meditation taking a class now and fight cancer that way so frustrating that the doctors refuse to discuss this stuff is it because they just keep up we are all very motivated to research and read but maybe they are not i will check out webmd thanks granma and somany i am glad to read what you reported about tamoxifen afraid to tell people i quit because it seems crazy but not really when you read reports about eye damage and the rest renee glad you having the problems having bonnie hi corky i was wondering about your statement that postmenopausal women are not usually treated with tamoxifen in the us what made you think this and where can i read about that do you know i would appreciate any information you can give me about this since i am postmenopausal and on tamoxifen and live in switzerland i know you said there were exceptions but i think in europe it is standard for er tumors no matter if you are or post menopausal i also was told i was given tamoxifen because it does not cause bone thinning as the aromasin does and i have serious osteoporosis thanks corky just trying to find out as much as possible about this dread disease mausie just read this on an article from the american society of clinical oncology meeting in chicago thought you all might find it interesting anastrozole sold by astrazeneca as arimidex and by others in generic form proved better than tamoxifen for preventing future breast cancers in a study of women who had surgery and radiation for a very early form of the disease called ductal carcinoma in situ or dcis more than cases of this are diagnosed each year in the united states the study compared five years of the drugs after about eight years of roughly 7 percent of women taking anastrozole had had a recurrence or a new breast cancer versus 11 percent of those on tamoxifen the benefit however was only in women under age 60 the drugs worked equally well for older women tamoxifen raises the risk of uterine cancer and blood clots main side effects are weakening bones and muscle and joint pain the complete story cancer conference good luck jalsmama i will be thinking of you hope all goes well i have a question for those who have finished chemo they had me stop after 7 taxol due to neuropathy which is fine but i have not had a period for 4 months and was told i was in menaupause hot flashes and all this morning i started bleeding what is going on does this mean that i am going to start back with monthy periods or is it something i should call my onc about any insight would be great thank you jen my hair was like clockwork day 14 after first chemo i started shedding little bits in my hand day 15 i hugged one of the little ladies i look after and nearly left her with a fur coat on her sweater my scalp had been extremely tender for those two days and on day 16 i had a friend give me a buzz cut the relief was tremendous i have heard many say the same thing so my guess is if it is not hurting you may be able to wait it out the oncology nurse told me my next tx starting taxotere will knock every hair out that is left on my body which very much at all i am as well i had my period every two weeks during the first three treatments and now i have been 5 weeks without i was always sooo regular the oncology nurse also said that i would be thrown into chemopause and probably stay that way given my age 47 following treatment that in way would be a blessing however this last week i have been suffering from mega hot flashes she said i might experience 3 years worth of hotflashes in 9 weeks fun fun fun ya just never know eh karyll lisamomoffourjoan my onc do tumor markers mater of fact she test unless a reason i had a muga before i started treatment and it seems others are getting mugas every 3 months on herceptin chemo granted i seem to have issues nor is there any history of heart issues dad get a pacemaker till 70 and mom at 73 has no heart issues the only test i had after the initial ct scans was a repeat of the liver ct which will be repeated in a year because they saw spots that they are pretty sure are cysts i know my bs also thinks tumor markers are unreliable so hopefully i have my head in the sand thinking everything is ok nothing hurts except healing shingles so not worrying about it btw i think too hot for may omaz thanks for the info also very interesting about the clonidine and your dry eyes i have dry eyes but by only taking 1mg per day or some days only that my eyes have been okay i do take extra measures for the dry eyes though the clonodine has made my mouth more dry which usually go hand in hand with dry eyes a conundrum to me but take what i can thanks for your response as well i know that effexor is one of the only meds that can be taken with tamoxifen i tried it briefly for depression as well as hot flashes and i had sexual side effects i was on a very low dose but was not willing to give up one of the small pleasures left in my life take hot flashes over sexual side effects any day with your exchange surgery been on femara since july 2010 achy shoulders terrific back pain had 2 bone scans a mri arthritis bulging discs that just happen since july last year so meds must be aggravating already present condition hair has grown in thin wavy instead of thick poker growing on top eyebrows are very thin eye lashes come out easily also on herceptin until july this says i will feel a lot better after done i hope so as all of you know continual pain drags you down even sweeping the floor becomes a chore some days have gained 11 lbs since start of chemo a total of 20 since leaving work in nov 2009 hate every ounce my surgeon told me yesterday a lot of these symptoms are also from herceptin looking forward to some sort of normal soon as sure you all are the onc suggested not taking aleve because it contains increase risk of heart attack ben gay muscle back tylenol plus tylenol 1 help some days i know any of you out there but with you every minute take care been on anastrozole since february of this year only 4 more years to go i have the hot flashes and night sweats but nothing unbearable what has suddenly gotten worse is the joint pain inmy feet andthumbs only bad when i first get up in the morning but after i get up and moving it gets better luckily it stopped me from working out i have any of the weight gain that other people have talked about actually i have lost 10 pounds since i started the medicine i would also like to hear what people do to help deal with the joint pain and hot flashes i did hear from someone who takes potassium to help with the side effects and even though she swears by it my oncologist says he has never heard of that my thoughts are with you and i hope the side effects are ok for you hi august chemo girls i have been reading the wonderful sharing on the discussion boards since my diagnosis but this is now my first post i did a lot of research in my journey and had opinions from 4 surgeon visits including dr laura 2 surgeon phone consults 5 plastic surgeons 1 oncologist visit 2 oncologist phone consults and 2 indirect oncologist consults dr mark dr christy my treatments have not been what was initially recommended by my community medical center i had a total tissue sparing mastectomy with single stage reconstruction with a silicone implant and i am having tch chemo developed by ucla and dr slamon living proof movie her 2 book for my her 2 status cancer i recommend getting as many opinions as i have had but i do recommend getting other opinions which may shape your care at your local facility as a physician myself i understand how physicians practice what feels safe and comfortable to them it mean they are wrong it just means you may want to take advantage of the courage of academic physicians who push the envelope i started my tch taxotere carboplatin herceptin chemo yesterday i had any symptoms yet except bloating constipation from the zofran nausea medicine there was a little fiasco about the neupogen which my friend picked up at the pharmacy for me while i was getting my chemo i read the instructions until today and learned the neupogen must be refrigerated the manufacturer amgen does not recommend keeping the neupogen at room temperature for more than 24 hours i spoke to amgen today and there is a chance the neupogen could remain stable for up to 5 days info i will go to the lab 2 days after i start the neupogen to make sure my neutrophils are shooting up and try to not waste the 2700 of medication i believe there is a good chance the product will be okay because it was in a cool place for only 22 hours out of the refrigerator i am using penguin cold caps to help keep my hair ucsf is having success rates depending on type of chemo and thickness of hair due to the wonderful support of the nursing manager and breast cancer coordinator the oncology clinic agreed to accept the donation of a medical freezer from the rapunzel project and kenra hair products the freezer arrived quickly and it was turned on yesterday but too late for me to use for my first cycle i used the dry ice cooler method yesterday which was hysterically chaotic but we made it work the freezer will be nice because it will avoid the process of obtaining the dry ice which runs 100 160 per cycle i also hope the freezer cools the caps more consistently so one part of the cap much colder than other parts the caps can be really cold for the first few minutes but the warm up quickly it is really important to make sure the caps are snug behind your ears and at the back of your head with the extra straps pull the straps very snug just put them on i brought an electric heated throw which i never used i was fine wearing my ski layers of a smartwool undershirt fleece jacket and fleece pants to help my hair and nails i am putting latisse on my eyebrows and eyelashes each evening it only takes a little bit i paint a bit on my eyebrows and rub it in with my fingertip and taking biosil one capsule twice daily when i refill the biosil i plan to switch to the liquid version 5 drops in cup juice which is cheaper at my next chemo cycle i will try to ice my fingers and toes to prevent nail problems but it will be the first thing i shed if it is too complicated because the cold caps and ice chips for my mouth are my priorities i am going to try to prevent neuropathy by taking glutamine 15g twice daily in juice vitamin b6 in the more active p5p form 50mg daily and alpha lipoic acid 600mg three times daily beginning 4 days after chemotherapy and stopping 2 days prior to the next chemotherapy per md anderson protocol which been showing any positive results but problems with compliance i have been purchasing most of my supplements from vitacost which has great prices and a reasonable reputation i wish everyone minimal side effects 1st round knockouts of our cancers and enrichment of our lives from the healing warmth of others during this journey kristina jiilmare it sound alike you are having a heavy shed at exactly the same time i did it should let up soon i had hairs sliding out all day long one following another and it is disconcerting i would find hairs wound around the railings of my stairs all over my furniture in my car on my clothing and in my food once i had a completely strange man pick hairs off of me in the market that was not a good thing even though he meant well treat your hair very gingerly no pulling on it no brushing no direct streams of water unless very soft and gentle pat on diluted shampoo and pat it through your hair until it suds up then rinse out very carefully i used the kitchen sprayer on very cool a few times turned down to very low and soft i also have a hand held shower spray which i would make very soft even so i tried to break its stream with my fingers to avoid hitting my scalp with too hard a stream this is not the time to worry about getting hair super clean if your hair is long when you go to bed try lifting it up and spreading it out above your head on your pillow i learned to sleep that way and think it helped because i lying on my hair i used a satin pillow case and even used a satin lined shower cap sometimes my hair eventually thinned out in overall volume but i always had hair covering my head i hope you will also hugs leslie i sucked on ice chips during taxotere it is supposed to help ward off mouth sores i do not think the change in taste is avoidable it lasts more than two weeks or did for me and just when i could begin to taste things a bit again i had another treatment and was back to yucky taste once more i would go to my favorite pizza place and order a pepperoni slice just to see if i could discern anything at all and usually could only detect the most distant bite of the spicy pepperoni but that was enough to let me know that i was eating it otherwise the usually scrumptious pizza was utterly tasteless and felt a bit like eating card board taste will come back after chemo pejkug dragonfly started having hand numbness both hands while she was sleeping beginning part of the way through rads i believe they think it is neuropathy which came on late in the game well after chemo my mild le started well after surgery but in the middle of chemo exacerbated by taxotere i ended up with cording and axillary web it dissipated about weeks after chemo ended but i had to fight for pt certified le visits and that has made a world of difference i just had the sleeve fitting on monday hello ladies a little over a year out from my chemo mine was exactly as described above 4ac then 4 taxol my biggest problems during tx was fatigue and finger neuropathy the neuropathy has completely gone away and my fingers are back to normal i had radiation so the fatigue stuck around a while in fact still pretty fatigued i have battled depression most of my life but with the horrible hormonal side effects i seem to shake it completely i have good days bad days ok days and days that totally suck i have two young boys 3 and 2 so i get the luxury of pulling the covers over my head for the whole day i am peri menopausal but my onc says its still too soon to know if permanent i actually had a regular period the first 4 months of this year every 28 days like before tx so we thought i was bouncing back then i stopped having my periods again was completely exhausted and emotional i cry over everything and i mean everything hot flashes and the wonderful old insomnia heading in to surgery this coming friday to start the recon process all over again so sure that stress help i found a natural non hormonal supplement at my local health food store to help with symptoms and i seem to get some relief i like taking medications so always on the look out for natural remedies i want to upset anyone or freak anyone out simply just trying to make u aware of some things that may happen my docs are great but they warn me about everything i love how these boards get info out there for us to share bc can be a very lonely disease even with the best support systems in place unless u go through it yourself hard to understand the feeling that come along with the dx good luck girls i know do great and kick some cancer butt this study is interesting to me wondered for some time what the of pr was needed for a better prognosis in er bc i know that this has nailed it down but it seems to be a more definitive study than the others read since the 14 cut off for ki67 is still debated sure this be the end of this discussion so the next question to answer what is the er threshhold for effective treatment with antihormonals read this question asked over and over on this site another question asking is since tamoxifen is less effective than ais in treating luminal b at what pr and ki67 does this become an issue facing having to consider switching from ais to tamoxifen because of a serious and rare eye se reappearing after switching from anastrozole and starting exemestane after an 8 week break looks like it might be a low estrogen problem because these two meds are chemically different based on this study solidly luminal b my 5 pr was always the question tamox may not be worth the switch if not going to be effective anyone heard of someone using estrogen eye drops when taking ais to manage eye ses i suspect much riskier than local vaginal estrogen treatment since bc mets occur in the eye i need to chew on some treatment options before i return to my mo and ophthalmologists with the bad news that the vision loss is returning thanks i am glad to read about this it puts my mind at ease a bit going into my last yay taxotere treatment on friday and this last one really wiped me out energy wise gave me some neuropathy on my face hands and teeth yup tingly teeth good times and made my calves and leg muscles ache terribly like done a serious boot camp workout like i used to be able to before chemo despite me not having much energy and not being able to do any exercise up until then very strange i am glad to only have one left and relaxed to know that this is normal going from being very fit and active to having my daily activity being walking across the room for a nap is very strange indeed i miss my muscles sweeney very honestly i do not want to scare you or anyone but i had a terrible reaction to the taxotere cytoxin combo it is the first one they throw at you and i was given a ton of misinformation by my onc and given no other choices he kept telling me get the treatment on thursday and be at work on monday not i had a delayed allergic reaction to the taxotere and it damned near killed me for real it was like someone had dropped me at ground zero at hiroshima my hair instanlty fell out a percentage of women remain bald forever and there is a website dedicated to the problems with the use of taxotere read it i am 8 months out and barely have any hair my skin began to literally melt off of my body i had blisters all in my mouth and down my throat for several months and could not eat or tolerate food i threw everything up my nails turned black and fell out and i have never in my life been so ill and felt so close to or wanting to die i am still suffering major after effects taxotere blew out my thyroid and damaged my heart and lungs i became anemic had no vitamin and now need regular b 12 injections the taxotere destroyed my veins and literally if a team needs a vein they cannot get one on my arm without doing major backflips i cannot go out in the sun at all i live on the beach with out getting sun poisening like in 15 minutes of exposure and cannot tolerate heat of any kind i have lost all of my beach activities like surf fishing or just walking the dogs on the beach in the daytime my gums are now receding and my perfect teeth are i was profoundly ihad a major head psych medshave stopped working and i may need togointo hospital to get stabilized again this is 8 months out iwas in a chemo coma for months and could not do anything for myself my onc was so freaked out saying he had never seen a response like mine that he basically dropped me he said he did not know what to do with me and that we would have to wait until the drug got out of my system i fired him immediately and went for second opinion at chapel hill the bc onc who saw me was stunned and outraged he said he had seen such severe reactions but only in people who had a ton of treatments of ct due to very advance cancer the opinion from three docs now is that i will never be able to safely take chemo again or to do radiation my body is too fried from the taxotere i must stress my case is unusual and apparently not the norm but man if it happens you do not want it happening to you it is the gift that keeps on allergic reactions happen right when they administer the first dose of ct mine did not i functioned for about four days feeling pretty awful then i exploded i had a minor heart attack after never had heart problems and now my bp will not stabilize my heart doc say he just put in a pacemaker for a woman who heart was destroyed by taxotere i have todrink gallons of water and gatorade a day bec i dehydrate so quickly during the first few months following i was so ill i was ambulanced to the er probably three times a exageration you can read all of my early posts on this thread from wheni had the ct combo in january had i known i would never have done it imean i would neverhave done a ct combo the treatment is worse than the cancer for me my first onc failed to research thati was taking two drugs that i have to take that inhibited my ability to process the drug out so it ricocheted around in my body destroying everything i now have major gastric problems and there are many foods i simply cannot eat without vomiting i just simply have not been able to recover from the taxotere again and i stress my case is unusual and the probably among the worst of what can happen from ct what was worse was that when things went south for me meaning i personally fit the gold standard ct treatment model the onc dumped me and i cannot get another onc bec i am told i am a walking lawsuit soi suffered thru this alone and would have given up without the support of the women on this board educate yourself and get a second opinion on all treatment options available to you there are different chemo cocktails that are much less drastic and some oncs tell patients to save the big guns for last if possible but do pull up the taxotere website and read about the experiences of other women who had it as bad as i did also read posts from women who got thru it ok to balance it out many women had a lot of trouble but nowhere near the extent thati had it bec of the damage done i am barred from taking any more chemo so if my cancer returns the only things they are offering me is surgery this is the toughest decision you will make and you are in control of your treatment if you have an advocate like a supporting sister to help use her to research i know you are scared but educate yourself and get another opinion about chemo options and the reality of using taxotere my opinion this is a cookie cutter treatment and they make a ton of money off of it so i have to wonder about the efficacy of resorting to the use of taxotere blessings and good luck in your you have control over your cancer know it is hard to believe i now have a full treatment team from chapel hill and it includes a nurse oncologist and an oncology psychiatrist it is a dream team andi so wishi had them before i trusted one man and jumped into the tc treatment biggest hugs and prayers sv hi karen i was the same age as you when i was 1st dx i had wle rads then onto zoladex for 2 years tamoxifen for 5 my onc was sure that the zoladex would push me into my natural menopause but she was wrong my periods came back about months after stopping zoladex unfortunately they were very heavy to begin with which i used to but did calm down after a while i think a definite answer about what to expect as it will depend on each own likelihood of an earlier menopause but be warned your periods could come back nicky lemonadehk taxol was ok i had a big rash on one of the weeks but mostly the biggest side effect was is the neuropathy my fingers and feet had neuropathy for the last weeks and for the last two weeks they hurt my fingers hurt to push the buttons on the remote or to open something so scissors are my friend now and my toenails have turned colors some are black dark colored and my two big toes are completely white but i think because the toenails themselves have loosened and may be coming off soon i have any nauseabut definitely fatigue i think however that nothing compared to a cwhich is much worse from what i hear hanging out in here to learn about what to expect from you guys with a c hi all happy new year been a while since been on so good to know that many of us are halfway there or more yay my 3rd tac was also the worst preparing now for the 4th next friday lisa cindy and jen glad to hear others are having hot flashes and sweats though sorry you have to deal with it i was going to ask about that they are such a pain i too am 44 and havent had a period since the 2nd tx can chemo jumpstart menapause that would be great very done with having periods for bad bone pain and body aches i had very severe pain from the taxotere and neulasta shot the first time since then my onc said to start taking my pain meds i take 2 percoset before i start having the pain then continue to take for the next several days regularly wow it really helps i sleep a lot but do not have that incredible pain maybe doing something similar will help some of you who are having that bone pain also a wig tip i wear any of my wigs because they felt too tight gave me a headache and were itchy turns out it was the under the wig thing that was too tight they were like pantyhose beanies to protect your scalp and i guess hold your hair in if you were wearing a wig when you have hair anyway i took a pair of panyhose and cut them just above the crotch then used it on my head much more comfortable i use two of them at a time so my head itch from the wig feels great kinda weird i know but maybe someone else was having the same problem now had my wig on for several hours and as comfortable as one of my hats scarves i may end up actually using it now for those of you excersizing kudos we got a dance dance revolution game for christmas and thinking of trying to use it regularly as some form of excersize not sure if i have the energy though everyone take care of yourselves and do something to pamper yourself today you deserve it love and prayers janet i had virtually no morning sickness with my two pregnancies and very little sickness with a c t chemo of course i took all the heavy duty meds with a c taxol seem to bring me nausea but does give me lots of stomach aches have a great day bc sisters miss s has anyone not lost their hair had 4 a c treatments and still have my hair starting 4 taxol treatments next week and just curious fatigue has been my only side effect so far shel i hope you are starting to feel better i had my treatments on a monday and felt the worst on thursday friday and saturday herceptin can cause symptoms i had shaking chills after my first two treatments that eventually went away and i no longer have side effects with herceptin i know what you mean about trying to get another glass of water down i wish i had discovered crystal light lemonade earlier on that turned out to be an easy way to get water down kay welcome i think you will find this site valuable glad you found it even with the same kind of chemo the drugs that are given with the chemo will vary from place to place nan told you what she got with her treatment my experience was different in the infusion room i first had blood drawn for a cbc while that was being tested i had a saline drip once the cbc results were back and i was cleared for treatment i got a drip of decadron and aloxi the decadron was to lessen the chance of allergic reactions from taxotere or carboplatin the aloxi is an med the goal is to keep nausea at bay for two days i then got taxotere followed by carboplatin followed by herceptin my first time with herceptin they ran the drip for an hour instead of the usual 30 minutes since it was a larger dose have any reactions at no time was i given benedryl my onc said that it necessary to give herceptin every week the approach she followed was a large dosefor the first treatmentthen the normal dose every three weeks now that i am only getting herceptin i get herceptin without any meds in a 30 minute drip once every three weeks taxotere can cause nail changes i used tea tree oil on my nails along with udderly smooth my big toenails got ridges early on the fingernails just a few each hand get funky until treatment 5 i never had any nails turn black or fall off i stopped the tea tree oil after treatment and my nails did get brittle as the funky parts grew out my nails have always been strong so it was definitely five months out from treatment things are back to normal good luck with your first treatment tomorrow terri i think part of the issue with wrinkles is chemopause and dry skin also some of us did this through winter so that had effect too there is a thread called physical aging appearance where others are sharing their tricks and tips for skin i hope some of my wrinkles around my eyes relax but not hopeful my nails are still a mess from taxotere i had a really bad reaction every toe finger nail effected fingernails are growing out but some still even after 13 weeks are lifted i want to even discuss my toenails expecting them to be better by next spring but my hair is good so at least that something eyelashes are slow growing but are growing too btw no regrets about not doing cold caps i think it would have been worth the hassle or discomfort in my case had dd taxol 3 yesterday the easiest one so far only one stick to get the iv in my hand the lady who does this is a pro and head of the blood draw or whatever they call it dept and been called in a few times when they get an iv in so i request her now i find that taxol is much worse for me than ac i have any real problems with ac except a bit of fatigue and hair loss and constipation i am having intense muscle bone pain along with periodicdiarrhea that is causing me serious problems also having some mild neuropathy in my feet that is completely managable i hope it stays that way and disappears completey once finished on disability so i can manage i worked through ac but near the end i was getting tired anyway one more to go and be finished with chemo and on to discussions about i told my mo today that i want my ovaries removed if possible i have spent so much time in these forums getting all the info i can about chemo and how to deal with it and now i have to switch gears and learn about hormonals i have to admit nervous about taking them since i got bc while taking tamoxifen plus they discussed seeing a dietary specialist and a physical therapist i need to start ramping up my excercise to rebound from chemo better plus i need to lose about 100 pounds to be at a normal weight this is more important than ever since fat produces estrogen tried for years to lose but stay on the wagon i understand that a lifestyle change and that is what makes it so hard but i need to give my self every chance of making sure i have to deal with this beast again and lowering my estrogen levels looks like the only way i can do this glad to see everyone doing well hi ladies just to let you all know developped oral thrush thanks to bloody t if you get a white coating on your tongue and it feels fat and flabby then get to your gp and get them to prescribe nyastin just picked mine up so i hope it works he recommended a natural remedy as well in the form of pineapple as apparently pineapple strips your tongue of coatings so it should strip it of the thrush apologies to share as thursh is grim but i wanted you all to know it was a possibility in case you get similar symptoms jelly xx marjorie i am so sorry to hear you are having to go through this too it stinks just when i was feeling pretty good and thinking about going back to work not sure if i can use my tumor markers as a guide as they had been normal when i was diagnosed and at last recheck the only abnormality on bloodwork was my circulating tumor cell count which was 46 but that too went down to 2 although that was about 6 weeks ago is arimidex known to cause bone joint pain i have perused the hormonal boards and i see alot of women complaining about bone joint pain with the ais not sure if any were worse than another i wonder if your oncologist would consider switching you to another just in case are you taking anything for the pain been using advil and tramadol but lately have had to resort to hydrocodone i just want to become resistant by having to use it so much i also take trigosamine as well as calcium and a lot of vit d as for doing anything out of the ordinary no i have been religious about walking and riding my bike everyday the problem is that it just one place my upper back neck which is most affected but also recently my femurs by my knees and occasionally hips and shoulders kind of all over nagging and sometimes stabbing pain i see my oncologist again in march and have a zometa infusion in a few weeks so mention it to the nurse then unless it continues to get worse i guess i was a little concerned that this could be a sign that my tamoxifen working anymore cat i had an oophorectomy last march initially i had planned to switch to arimidex however the tamoxifen side effects are quite tolerable and read several recent studies that say that the 2 yrs of tamox 3 years of ai regimen was as good as 5 years on an ai when i had my 6 month check up with my onc last april the first thing she said was like to keep you on tamoxifen for the next year and a half before switching you to arimidex so we both came to the same decision independently i wanted to delay taking the ais because of the bone aches bone loss and how it affects hair growth mine is still growing back from chemo thanks outfield you must have been thrilled to have the level 10 nausea gone on the taxol i think my biggest mistake in my first round was just not eating enough i gave into misery and ginger ale i was religious with my meds but it was a suffer fest a lifetime endurance athlete and can handle and invite tons of misery for hours but the a c was unmanageable how were your other ses on taxol been taking tamoxifen for a week now and i could swear the neuropathy i acquired during chemo is getting worse even though 10 weeks pfc figured revive this thread in case anyone else is experiencing this i see any indications for neuropathy w tamoxifen but for me the tamox is the only thing new maureen are you still doing well post taxotere i read a post one day this week that said taxotere was horrible and she would gladly exchange ac for taxotere she was talking about the flu like effects of taxotere and how she able to get out of bed for 3 days i sat down and cried my eyes out i hope and pray you are still doing well my last ac was and about a week after chemo i developed thrush for the first time the onc called me in keto something or other and it cleared right up after it cleared up i was supposed to switch to taking the antibiotic every other day three days ago i spiked a fever and the thrush and mouth sores are back with a vengence it is so unbelievable painful definitely the worst se i have had i eaten in three days i can barely swallow my throat and tongue are so swollen that my neck is swollen and i am still running a low grade fever on and off of course my onc is closed for the holidays and the onc has not called me back although i called him at 30 this morning i know it is christmas but i am miserable my dh and i are debating on whether to go the er to see if they can give me anything else to start healing my mouth when iwas wishing earlier this week to lose some weight this is not what i had in mind does anyone have any ideas for me i can only hope that this time next year this journey is a distant memory for all of us merry christmas susan not sure if the absence of hot flashes is scientifically proven issues i know at one time the thought was if you have them with tamoxifen you were not getting the best use of it in your body and they did a cyp 2d6 test to see if you were metabolizing the tamoxifen properly what they found is the lack of side effects indicate that you were not metabolizing it well so not sure if lack of side effects for aromasin is a predicter if i had time i would try to look at the research since changing to greenstone manufacterer for my aromasin was seeing a decrease in side effects but today the arm aches and finger joint pain is back nothing unmanageable but it is there just taking aleve to see if that will help i wonder if it is just a thing that comes and goes some days not so bad other days ouch renee i was on effexor while on tamoxifen in hopes that it would help with hot flashes and as a replacement for the wellbutrin i had to stop taking during that time i was only on it for 8 months 4 years ago but it was of no help for the hot flashes and work seamlessly in the background for depression the way wellbutrin did i always felt a bit anxious on it my doctor switched me to an ai to see if i would have fewer problem ses and i followed the tapering off schedule provided by my shrink to go off of effexor but it include the idea of removing a few grains at a time from the capsule i did not fare well on my schedule even though it took about a month i did feel ill in many ways while i tapered off but the worst was a very odd sensation of an electric current zapping across my brain and back again i could feel it and hear it zap inside my head it was truly frightening even though they only happened 2 or 3 times a day for a couple of weeks i started up with my wellbutrin again as soon as the doctor allowed and i began to feel better immediately i know if i would have had lingering problems from the effexor but very grateful i have to find out it really suit my physiology at all this is from the adverse events section of the prescribing info on very tiny print sheet that comes with the bottle that the doctors supposedly use for info about a drug patients receiving arimidex had an increase in joint disorders including arthritis arthrosis and arthralgia compared with patients receving tamoxifen arthritis is inflammation of one or more joints which results in pain swelling stiffness and limited movement there are over 100 different types of arthritis medline plus medical encyclopedia arthrosis is a degenerative disease of a joint medline plus medical dictionary arthralgia is pain in one or more joints medline plus medical dictionary parasthesia is also a listed side effect of arimidex this is a sensation of pricking tingling or creeping on the skin having no objective cause and usually associated with injury or irritation of a sensory nerve or nerve root medline plus medical dictionary if these describe carpal tunnel syndrome a condition caused by compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel and characterized especially by weakness pain and disturbances of sensation in the hand and fingers abbreviation plus medical dictionary i know what does the carpal tunnel is a bony structure where several bone come together in the wrist joint with nerves running right through the middle of it arimidex affects both the bones and the nerves so tell your doctor to read his homework hi lisa 2012 i have finished my a c treatments and am on my 4th of 12 treatments of taxol and herceptin then i will have 40 more weeks of herceptin and 6 weeks of radiation after my 12th taxol is finished i noticed about 2 days ago when i looked in the mirror that i have new hair growing on my head i was so excited like you said a 5 shadow on my head the hair is really soft dark like my hair used to be before i started to go grey 0 i remember all the tears i had when i got my head shaved because of not wanting to deal with the clumps coming out once it started coming out i had it shaved my eyebrows are thinning nothing happening yet with my eye lashes it is so weird that when your on taxol your eye brows may thin or come completely out may lose your eye lashes but the hair on your head will start coming back hair is hair makes no sense to me but i am very happy that i am getting some hair to start coming back i am in no way ready to stop wearing my wig when i go out i untll i have enough short hair to have a hair style my oncologist said that it will grow out slowly you heard me when i went to work after i noticed that i had new hair growing i was telling everyone and they all said wow i heard you this happy in a long time 0 i had the shot the day after my four rounds of ac and the day of my three rounds of taxol my dr give us a choice i had mild bone pain and major muscle aches with the ac and major bone pain with the taxol but not sure if it was the taxol causing some of it too i would do it again becuase my white cell fell very low from day one of chemo i only ended up in the hospital once and that was my last chemo i did have home antibotics three times though anyone out there with early stage cancer hormone negative node negative but her 2 positive tumorstarting their treatment with the taxol herceptin for 12 week then after herceptin every 3 weeks for 9 months pretreat with tagamet pepcid and benadryl but me and decadron even mg good together felt underwater like pressure in head which started moment of infusion for 3 days which intensified during taxol and 1st day they switched or reduced not sure my iv steroid to one they injected in iv and add additional injection of benadryl right before taxol i also take 1 25mg benadryl every 4 hours after i get home starting in afternoon for swelling symptoms benadryl generally knock me out after 2nd day this week i started on zyrtec daily this week pre treat adjustment helped a lot wish i need the steroid i want swollen face or other side effects of that i had the nosebleed start this week 3rd treatment fatigue at predictable times and my hair is starting to come out in the shower filled up styrofoam cup when a breeze hits i feel like a dandelion lol hoping they keep reducing steroid meds i do well on them but 3 down 9 to go ready to get this done without a stop really not as bad as i expected though so far hi oaktownmom been on letrozole femara for a little over a year i have very little joint pain but i also take glucosamine and chondroitin daily i have muscle pain in my thighs but as long as i stay away from allergens it is manageable i have not experienced vaginal dryness i had some problem with my hair falling out and my nails breaking but started taking biotin and that problem has gone away on the other hand i have to get a pedicure more often as my nails and hair grow faster when i take biotin constipation can be a problem so be sure to drink a lot of water and eat vegies and fruit overall my digestion is much more sensitive than it used to be i get indigestion easily when i used to have a cast iron stomach so i make sure to take probiotics and always have something like tums or rolaids on hand i also take ginger capsules daily i always take the medicine in the evening as i get fatigued from it both the fatigue and achiness is made more manageable by daily exercise i also try to get a massage every other week as that also helps my muscles stay more fluid experience can be different though for example tamoxifen almost killed me so what i experience may not bear any resemblance to yours cocobean there have been times when i feel like little old lady and can barely move after sitting laying down if i sit down too long or wheni get up in the morningand then stand up my feet hurt initially i have to wait a second or two to get steady on my feet since afraid just fall down or my legs will collapse from under me i know the chemo muscles aches pains are no fun and make it difficult to want to move i know that i became more easily winded after the 4thround which moving around or walkingup stairs easy however onceyou are pfc the aches pains and winded feeling subside thebeing out of breathmay be from having low red blood counts anemia i tried to prevent a further drop in the red blood counts by eating more red meat and green leafy veggies i did a little research by going to the website and put in a search of foods toincrease red blood counts i still have someminor aches pains which i believe is from the tamoxifen that i started in september 2012 my feet do sometimes ache first thing in the morning before i get out of bed i try to wiggle those toes and rotate my ankles while sitting on the side of the bed before i actually stand up you do have so much to look forward to being pfc getting to move more easily will just make you feel better emotionally and physically just remember that the first few weeks after your last chemo will be like the weeks you have after chemo so try not to get disappointed that you feel immediately better after your last chemo there will one day that you wake up and you suddenly realize that you feel good and you have come through to the other side wow i believe how differently this effects everyone my hair started coming out before my second ac treatment but the day after my second treatment i put the brush through my hair and all the hair just came right out in the brush it was awful i switched to a comb and shaved the rest off that night i lost all the rest of my hair everywhere too then on taxotere it started coming back except for the eyelashes and eyebrows which came out after the second treatment everything is coming back now but very slowly still only 17 days pfc and on herceptin so i guess this is just i have to deal with all the pics are so encouraging and beautiful i wait to get there too and post a pic lago glad to see you back looking forward to seeing your latest pic taxotere caused my nails esp on my toes to lift and come off what was left underneath is hard to describe atough growth my onc saidnails would regrow but i have yet to see any signs of that my last chemo was 2 mos ago has anyone experienced this is there anything to put on the nails that will help i live in a warm climate where everyone wears sandals would love to think i can stop hiding my feet eventually sure appreciate any help you could give on this hi very tough time for you and so many decisions to make i was 39 when diagnoised last year and had 4 cycles of ac chemo followed by radiotherapy and now tamoxifen for 5 years i continued to have a period during chemo but at the end of my chemo the blood test showed i was in menopause status but could not tell if it was permanent of not 2 months later i did another blood test and was back ovulating my periods continued and even now that i am on tamoxifen zoladex and lupron as far as i know shut down the ovary function so these drugs would stop you getting pregnant i was warned about betting pregnant on tamoxifen so i got the copper coil inserted as a contraceptive what i was told is that the closer you are to your natural menopausal age when you have chemo the greater the chance of going into permanent menopause the good news is that you are only in your 30 s so that is in your favour the best of luck to you mw93 and lindee on the same regimen as you are but a few weeks behind have my 2nd taxol this friday i felt like i had been hit by a truck on the 3rd day after with the same bone joint pain as you had really worried about the neuropathy after this next treatment lindee sorry you feel so lousy i hope you feel better soon so you can finish on schedule mw93 i hope i have your taxol experience for the remainder of my treatments i will handle the bone joint pain better this time by taking pain meds sooner burley and writer i have noticed a drop off in people checking in too at first it was a flurry of cards emails phone calls but now that old news people have moved on i wish people were still offering to bring us dinner i have learned a lot through this about how i will treat others who have had surgery or are in treatment i know what appreciated and what i all the best to everyone who is having treatment this week gina i felt anywhere remotely near fantastic since i was still walking around with untreated stage iv ibc i believe i had such a serious disease at the time i was diagnosed i felt too healthy my mind was sharp i was living my life the way i wanted to ate well slept well and the only pain i had was the occasional twinge in my right breast the sensation was just like the sensitive breasts at menstrual time and once in awhile my left hip would hurt not constantly or unbearably just enough to notice it and wince for a moment or two being 47 years old at the time i attributed the occasional hip pain to approaching old age until after the staging scans showed i had a met on my left iliac bone and i was still doing everything i wanted to be doing i start feeling like total crap until i began treatment which i had to be talked into i was going to decline originally and in some respects sorry i convinced the treatment that sent my qol straight into the toilet sooo for the time being and since about a month ago finally feeling ok at least also true that right now is the best ever felt since i started treatment chemo then hormonals but be a liar if i told you i was feeling fantastic though a long way off from that and quite frankly i expect to ever feel fantastic again as long as i have to be on some sort of treatment just to forestall progression stay alive i still have residual chemo brain and all my creative sparks are totally gone also i have too many regular daily hot flashes stiff joints painful feet and neuropathy in my arms from aromasin i also had severe depression and insomnia from aromasin but an antidepressant wellbutrin seems to have fixed the depression i still feel off anda little too sad too often but i cry all the time for no reason anymore and i got back my energy and just enough drive to do what i need to do the combination of a supplement called alteril and the prescription med lunesta has sufficiently alleviated the insomnia my sleep is still not as good as it used to be before treatment but better than been so for now ok and unless some way to just instantly zap the cancer out of my body with no ses at all have to say that given the circumstances at my best lena stephanie i do abraxane 3 weeks on 1 week off so my side effects are surely milder than what you can expect that being said the main problems i have with it are bone joint pain and neuropathy in my toes feet my hair hung on probably longer than usual and i have had a little bit of regrowth in some places even while the hair is falling in others i get zofran in the iv along with decadron not necessary with abraxane but my onc still orders it because i reacted to taxol and the decadron helps me with the bone pain i have kytril tablets to take every 12 hours for a day or two after the infusion i apparently have quite a sensitive stomach as all these things make me nauseated the most troublesome s e i have is intense we know that comes with just about every tx out there the good news is that i started having relief from the pain of my bone only mets within a couple of weeks of starting the pain relief was greater than when i had rads or when i was taking lots of pain meds obviously onc and i are encouraged that the pain and lowering tm test numbers although not completely reliable for me mean the abraxane is kicking butt i also get avastin every two weeks be praying for you stephanie hugs diane almost 11 weeks pfc and shedding like mad i have very fine hair a fair bit of it i guess and all i can say is i had better wait to commit a major crime until i leave dna every single place i go i really worry going to go bald new hair is coming in in the places of total loss around my face so even if i did i would be sort of ok with it i had a real terror of being one of the depending on who you ask who have permanent hair loss i really wonder if 100 of taxotere treated women used caps whether that percentage would drop to zero in other words can the caps prevent taxol induced permanent hair loss to me that is the biggie yea it would suck to be bald but i would have gotten through it we all would it does grow back except when it there is simply no excuse for the medical community to refuse to explore this issue by insisting that all women treated with a taxol be fully informed and offered this option oh wait there is an excuse it is just hair hopex congratulations on being done with chemo my last one new years eve yay toastiecat i have a fear that my hair will not grow back also i normally keep my head covered when i am home and i had chemo brain really bad and came out of my bedroom with no scarf or hat on my middle son did not say anything but i freaked out myself when i noticed it mariposa enjoy the lollipops glad they help with the nausea i am going to start taking biotin after last chemo and start using nioxin hair system which helps with thinning hair has anyone had the problem with hands feet and legs falling asleep with the taxol i have the finger toe numbness lately limbs are falling asleep too hope everyone had a wonderful christmas and all have no disappointed as diagnosed with mets to lungs and bones august 2012 and have been on femara since was all good last scan in december but the one last week showed lungs are improving which is wonderful but a tumor in lower spine is growing what a bummer i am having an mri tuesday and will start rads and abraxane for 4 months and hopefully after those will get back to another ai has anyone had similar and were able to get back on hormone treatment am dreading chemo again and losing my hair i have been feeling achy and tired but was not expecting this news i felt sick on hearing the news but coming to terms with it and feeling more positive now well as much as i can love gail log in to post a reply gwenie 56 welcome to this board i hope you will find it awesome many of us find this to be our ultimate solace place where we openly talk about everything and nobody judges us my as well as the present one have said to me that i will be cured if there is no recurrence by 2015 i guess they believe in the 5 year mark but i love to hear aboutthe 3 year mark although it depends on when you want to start counting from the diagnosis or treatment i finished chemo on december 30 2010 and i started radiation march 1 march 31 so there was a gap of 2 months in between chemo and rads for me i did taxol every two weeks dose dense i did have some neuropathy but not so bad it was very doable i think for me taxol was very easy compared to ac i would like to add that i have been thinking of leah also and hope we hear from her soon sending positive energy to you leah to all the last ones this week congratulations it is a difficult road and you made the journey terry i have those same fears about rads i struggled through one last week of work before i finally said i could not do it anymore just so i would have that week during rads i have saved two weeks off i am blonde and have larger breasts and worry about the skin effects i am already stressing about not wearing a bra and trying to figure that out and still going to work my vision has worsened a bit but i think my hearing has changed at least not that the kids are yelling at me to turn the tv down yet marsha i was wondering too about what to do the last day the nurse already told me they have a party for me cake i switched drs after round five but have had the same nurse now for an apt and two chemos and she has been awesome i was thinking of something special for her and then cookies from a nice specialty store for everyone else did you come up with anything new you are so creative by the way i imagine going on to rads without you and your wonderful humor either we stay on two boards or you become an honorary member of the rads group i have an apt with the rads onc yet should i no one has said anything but i want to keep things rolling my last abraxane has not been too bad right now imodium is my friend but then i will take that over throwing up any day having some pain and so far advil is working but i have also stayed pretty close to the couch the last two days tomorrow i get my henna tattoo i will try to take a pix and post i sure wish this was my last tx i believe i have to do this one more time karen hello nancy and maxgirl so nice to hear from you nancy sorry about your long drive but if you have a therapist you like you would probably drive even farther i bet how often do you have to go maxgirl always been more of a lurker than a poster too i just had the my fourth infusion of 12 yesterday 7 more days of oral cytoxin before my next 2 weeks of rest as for side effects i can honestly say this is easier than the ac t that i had last year but making myself take the 4 pills of cytoxin every day is hard remember when we would ask the chemo nurse to slow down the cytoxin drip to avoid the excruciating headaches well i have to take the pills all together and so been having 2 week long headaches ouch also stomach distress as with the other drugs and fatigue but at least i have that killer taste of dead rotting meat that i had with ac t hooray for small blessings also pondering about whether i should get a port placed again i just had it taken out in november and the idea of another surgery is distressing to me but yesterday it took 3 people to get my iv in my veins are deep and tend to blow as soon as they stick em i think i will at least try again on the next treatment i still think i can stand that discomfort more than another surgery see what my onc thinks too anyway so nice to hear from you let us know going on in your lives marsha hi i need help i am 67 and just started tamoxifen i get small sweats but my problem is not being able to get to sleep i feel wired and i even stay in bed i can read no good i can watch tv but i continue to stay up till 3 or even 5 am i am taking meds to sleep and they do not work i exercise i am gaining weight glad to know i am not alone i figure i will deal with that after i get some sleep i have the last surgery for reconstruction in 2 wks really not worried about it need help with sleep please found lump stage 2 a estrogen lumpectomy redone no clean margins 12 chemo 13 mastectomy both reconstruction radiation coming finish reconstruction currently taking taxol weekly had ac every three weeks for four txs first round for me taxol is much milder and the easier to live with tomorrow i will have 6 and so far had some tingling in hands and feet digestive sensitivity off and on bad taste in my mouth tiredness seems to be cumulative some aches in legs and lower backoff and on probably rate all these a on a scale of 10 being the most severe except for taste that would be a6 at least talked the doctor into cutting my steroid from 20 mg to 4 that helped a lot i like the from the steroid biotene moisturizing mouth spray helps the bad taste advil helps with the aches tums and prevacid help the digestive problem nothing helps the tiredness hope this helps you a bit oh on a really good note my hair has started growing slowly janina get those nioxin products use them faithfully and most people even know that shedding a little as for the cmf side effects done pretty well been two years now for me since i finished the treatments and noticed no side effects except for the chemo brain that seems to be getting better with time i have joint issues but that is from the arimidex and not the cmf i know lisa has some liver problems from the cmf that is why it is so important to drink lots of water after your treatments to flush those chemicals out of your system overall i think find cmf pretty doable good luck with 1 i continued to bowl on 2 leagues while doing cmf chemo and golfed when the weather cooperated my golf game was a little off because my strength was not the same but i was out there anyway and back to normal now sure be able to do pretty much whatever you want to do in fact i felt better when i was doing some type of exercise instead of just sitting around waiting for something to develop thinking of you as you start this part of your journey rita sanddogger hello i was diagnosed with ilc back on 22 july 08 i am 56 i am both estrogen and progesterone positive and her 2 positive my tumor was very very large 10 cm and highly vascular this thing grew very fast i was given neoadjunct chemo and it did shrink my tumor a lot after chemo it was about a fourth the size no hard areas left with most of the swelling gone i had 12 weeks of chemo taxol and herceptin and then another 12 weeks of cytoxon epirubicin 5 fu and herceptin once every 3 weeks i just had a modified radical mastectomy and will find out in about 8 days exactly how much cancer was left chemo was tough taxol gave me really bad muscle and joint pain but i took it one treatment at a time doctors gave me medication which worked wonders and i took it at the first sign of nausea that way it get its ugly foot in the door i will find out next week if i will have any more chemo hang tough sometimes it seems like it is endless just take it one step at a time some who develop neuropathy have it at a permanent and debilitating level that would be my argument since there is no way to know in advance who this will affect there is also no guarantee that the supplements will help i had mild neuropathy even though i took these supplements with my permission but it did resolve within months after the end of chemo i had fingertip and tongue tingling and numbness that resolved prior to each infusion but the longer lasting issues were the soles of my feet i will never know if it would have been worse without supplementation and i know others who were not as fortunate good luck just wanted to add the c in my tch was carboplatin i developed ringing in my ears after the first dose but mine was not low dose this appears to be a permanent issue for me i have any side effects really from the adriamycin or cytoxan aside from my hair falling out 13 days after my first round of ac and my heartrate went up which happen to everyone adriamycin can damage heart valves but it happen to everyone be monitored cytoxan gave me a funky fizzy feeling in my brain during the infusion sorta like if swimming and got water up your nose that burning feeling but that was just me ymmv drink drink drink take your meds too if gotten a scrip for emend a lifesaver no nausea for me at all good luck and be praying for you robin i had the ac t dose dense every 2 weeks thru the summer they gave me 2 kinds of meds to prevent any nausea which was great i also had to take the neulasta shots which really caused the fatique and bone pain with the ac i think i did better tolerating the ac better than the taxol it made me feel horrible just achy and very weak i also gained 7 lbs on it though i had lost 5 with the ac but my appetite was good on the ac just the extreme fatigue and body pain on the ac no nausea allformy 4 46 md i had my fiirst taxol last monday today is day 7 if you count infusion day i was good on day 2 and 3 felt like a million bucks the best i felt in 6 weeks day 4 body aches flu like symptoms no nausea i had to use my pain medication with aome tylenol and felt a bit better i have just been weak and achey for the last few days i would say i would take taxol anyday over the red devil rather have body aches then that severe fatigue where you get out of your own way rating has been good i have any reaction while the taxol infused but that doeant mean the second dose wont i also have tingling and numbness in both fingers and toes i have an appoint wed with dr szal radiology for radiation will get treatment schedule onc chemo and surgery is done hope all have minimal se hugs and love to all jenn good morning ladies last day of fec yesterday went smoothly had a great nurse this go around and my viens dont hurt like they did with the second nurse i had wont let her near me again 1 poor one out of 3 not bad and i think the second one was quite new onc added in some new meds for sickness taking ativan on top of 3 others and so far much better than round one and two but this is my first morning so we shall see i only have to take the steriod booster for today instead of 3 days like last time as it made me so weepy lying in a fetal postition crying eyes out allt he time i was pathetic anyone noticing their typing skills going to shit i definetly am more sensitive to the sun not that we have had much here in alberta but the two days we did i went on the deck for about 20 min and was starting to burn already will have to wear bit royal wedding hats all summer for sure i am so glad to be half way done moving on to docotaxoral for the next 3 nurses say it will be much easier on my veins so i am happy about that but geuss it brings along some bone pain poo oh well 3 more i can do this my parents are here first time i ahve seen them since diagnosis so was a bit akward at first but getting to have someone doing my laundry and cooking for few days for sure also i think they actually get what i am going through now they came with me to chemo and my dad broke out in cold sweat just from them putting in the iv so he had leave lol didnt need him passing out there mom and i talked a bit about our feelings just scratched the serfice but it was a start sorry about all the spelling mistakes brain doesnt connect to fingers as well right now i am off work now for the week then will return for the

watching that on and off today lol maybe i will just take a sleeping pillhugs to you all i am supposed to start tamoxifen in february after my clinical trial with chemo ends i hope i get side effects from it i did take arimidex for about a month and had some joint pain but i still have it so i really think it might be from the tac i had feb june and seemed a little tired but no other side effects i was actually supposed to be on tamoxifen but my oncologist forgot i was premenopausal pre chemo why i took the arimidex so if i have problems with tamox i may see about removing my ovaries and taking an ai although i would rather have a couple years on tamox and switch so i lose the bone density violet do not consider quitting chemo please 24 weeks away from chemo and i cannot belive how fast time has gone i thought chemo would never end but it did definitely not an old timer but i found my lump 1 year ago on and still here had lumpectomy 4 ac 4 taxol dose dense plus 25 rads plus 7 boosts they gave me everything they could for now i feel great joint pain from taxol is gone i walk 2 miles per day eat right sleep well but i turned into an organic vegan totally no alcohol type person i feel that moderation is the key had a mammo in nov everything was good see the chemo onc next month every 3 for 2 years have another mammo scheduled for may see the bs then too i like seeing the doctors the last time they told they were cutting me loose for 3 months that was just great to hear i skipped out of the center but looking forward to going back again to hopefully hopefully hopefully hear the same thing see you in 3 months hi dkelly you say what sort of treatment you had but even if recoving from surgey that can take its toll and if you add chemo and or radiation and then tamoxifen to the mix the combinatino can wipe you out i started experiencing fatigue a few months after starting tamoxifen as well i had started tamoxifen about a month after finishing radiation and i was never sure if it was lingering effects of radiation which too hard on me or tamoxifen i was able to exercise and work fine but i was wiped out at the end of the day always been horrible about going to bed on time and suddenly i was going to bed early after another month or so i started feeling more energetic again clinical trialsresearchers compare overall survival in women undergoing chemotherapyby mary alice hartsock lbbc staff reviewed by linda t vahdat mdphase iii trial for women with advanced metastatic or locally recurrent cancer will compare the new chemotherapy eribulin mesylate e7389 with standard chemotherapiestrial starts 2006sponsored by eisai medical research inc a trial from eisai medical research inc will compare the new chemotherapy medicine eribulin mesylate e7389 to various standard chemotherapies in women with advanced metastatic or locally recurrent breast cancer this phase iii trial called a multi center study of e7389 versus treatment of choice in locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer or embrace will examine which chemotherapy better improves overall survival in women previously treated with two to five chemotherapy regimens about e7389e7389 is an investigational medication developed from halichondrin b which comes from a marine sponge the medication suppresses the growth of compounds called microtubules that promote cell division and tumor progression by stopping cell division e7389 may prevent the formation of new cancer cells a previous trial confirmed the safety of e7389 side effects included low white blood cell counts and mild or moderate nausea dehydration fatigue neuropathy tingling in the hands and feet joint pain and breathing problems this trial will be the first to compare the effectiveness of e7389 to other chemotherapies structure of the trialresearchers will randomly assign participants to one of two treatment arms participants in one arm will receive a standard treatment chosen by their physician participants in the other arm will receive e7389 the study treatment this study is meaning the doctor and participants will know which medicine the participant is receiving two out of every three participants will receive the study medication after comparing the effectiveness of the two arms in terms of overall survival or the number of participants who live during a length of time researchers will examine each group for signs of disease progression tumor response and safety of e7389 who can participate researchers are seeking 630 participants for this trial you can participate if you are 18 years or older are female and for more information on eligibility speak with your healthcare provider for more information contact hi joy and lori your cases do sound similar to my again for info i forwarded your posts and she was encouraged i am so glad your tumors are makes it all worthwhile she is meeting with oncologist i think taxotere is in the taxol family if so the side bad word choice right sal effects were not so bad i did have the one allergic reaction but i first time when the drip went slower it takes longer to administer the ac heard i have to take the steroids 3 days and i also take the emend this time i took no other once i was through with the emend 3 pack i also am ravenous and can eat anything i get a little flushed feverish the first 2 days though the 2nd time not as much just feel out of it low energy for 3 days i really notice any water weight my knuckles are a little swollen especially when i walk alot but my energy is good as i am still with friends so hopefully taxol will be go okay joy was chihuahua puppies the plan kmk mardibra my mo recommended 3 senecot s tablets after each meal followed by 5 oz of prune juice oh and fluids fluids fluids this is more than the dose recommended on the box but working for me as long as i miss a dose i also try to get 28 grams of fiber a day but some days i have trouble getting that down not sure if my constipation was from the taxol or from the zofran for nausea but it sounds like yours good luck ladies i just need to vent a little i have been onanastrozole since august the joint pains started with taxol was too dificult to deal with lately the aches whether joint or muscle seen to be happening more often this evening for instance top center of my back knees lower back at night i ache on my right onco says it may be a bursa sp i forgot to mention it to my pcp for a recommendation i think also the med may bedepressing my mood as typing i can feel tears that are trying to seep out i only gained about 7 lbs so far since starting the meds butit could be from the month of predisone that i was on for a dry persistent cough that lasted two months andrefused to go away until i started taking the predisone at night i go between the sweats and chills and being uncomfortable because of the aches i will have first bone scan in march good for the achesand how often i know that exercise helps and staying hydrated and i hope to resume that soon thanks for reading and listening to me wanda ok folks starting taxotere tomorrow the plan is to check my right arm good arm see how the inflammation is doing talk with my surgeon who will be right there as well and make a decision about whether it would be ok to use good arm or need to use the surgery side options would be i know delay again or find a vein somewhere else not on bad arm i keel finding things that say the most recent thinking is that punctures cause lymphedema but can exacerbate it if already present anyway the whole arm thing distracts me from my anxiety over strartkng feel like back at the beginning all over again not knowing how my body will react to new drug but the good news is i am halfway done woohoo got two great cancer cookbooks out of the patient library full of really yum sounding recipes appropriate for every side effect and easy hoping i will have some interest in trying them after tomorrow have a great day ladies hi onc said the same thing yours did tamoxifen until sure definitely in menopause right now my period makes an appearance maybe 3x year then one of the ais reading about the ai ses on this board make excited about taking them but my onc said that if possible when menopause starts during the 5 yr tamox period that results are better for women who have been on a combo of drugs vs just tamox i just turned 52 if i never see my period again be too soon done my time 40 years is quite enough thank you btw does anybody know why everything i post has that edit delete message underneath feeling like a citizen no stomach problems for me w the big t i take it in the morning after breakfast flushes are manageable at this point but i feel like my hair is thinning maybe i have such fine straight hair cut very short that hard to tell may be just another bad cut sigh i need thinner hair but sure there are some ladies on this board who would gladly change places with me so no complaints take care all lynn chattipatti whether having discharge or becoming extra dry while on tamoxifen or other therapy seems to be an individual thing highly recommend you see another doctor gyn pcp if your onco culture your discharge the only way to know for certain if you have something that needs to be treated bv yeast etc or not rather than suffering for a long time as i had mentioned in an earlier post even my pcp said that she want to wait until the culture came back before starting some type of treatment for relief at the very least if your tissues are irritated from extra discharge or yeast see the many suggestions from the above posts for some relief in the meantime hard to believe that y out from my diagnosis my cancer journey is going smoothly and still dancing w ned i am on a gi detour as i call it w after effects from chemo and rads according to my pcp and 2 osteos my med rad oncos disagree as i did not have any gi issues during active treatment and they started and or got worse 2y after chemo ended i agree w my pcp and osteos as my mild fructose malabsorption before cancer has become quite severe afterwards anyway in that time been on tamoxifen switched after i started getting out of control diarrhea that be linked back to anything other than possibly the tamoxifen and my onco swore up and down my hormonal assays indicated i was definitely postmenopausal unfortunately switching away from tamoxifen do the trick as it was mostly due to sibo we later discovered and fructose malabsorption back to tamoxifen again when my ovaries suddenly woke up y later and now currently back to anastrozole again as i am supposedly postmenopausal again my fingers eyes and toes are crossed that i am finally and truly postmenopausal it was a nightmare when my ovaries woke up and i want to ever have to go through that again my gyn got switched to an ob gyn and i even had to do an endometrial biopsy which thankfully came back negative during my first time on tamoxifen i did my research and found out that of the 3 types of estrogen estradial estrone estriol in our bodies estriol is the one least implicated in breast cancer btw here in ca estriol has to be compounded when applied topically to your vaginal urethral area you get the most impact to tissues that need it w the least amount being absorbed into your body i ran this info by my med rad surgical oncos as well as my pcp and like n6tmax doctor they all for me to use it while on tamoxifen since it is a serm some doctors will allow estring but mine felt estriol would be much safer in my case since i had er pr late stage bc y later my body had adjusted and i was rarely using the estriol anymore when i got switched to anastrozole the 1st time around just in case i did double check about using it if needed while on anastrozole but was told not to since an ai and not a serm when i was back on tamoxifen the 2nd time around i did not need the help of estriol anymore i do still get the occasional itchies sometimes quite intense whether from hormonal changes or maybe even as side effect of frequent loose stools i know what i do know is that 100 virgin coconut oil and oatmeal cream i only rarely add this are extremely soothing and stops the itchies in their tracks both are much safer imho than using crisco shortening which some on this board talk about crisco contains hydrogenated vegetable trans soybean oil take pure natural coconut oil any day over crisco coconut oil is a saturated fat consisting mostly of medium chain triglycerides and full of lauric and caprylic acids coconut oil is and recent research reveals much healthier for us than we were misled to believe by the soybean vegetable oil industry as my pcp says coconut oil is very good for me and can be safely used internally and externally of course you do want to scoop out the external use portion into a separate container from the food use one very good for hair and skin too just be sure to use a very light barely there layers that are each allowed to soak in before applying another used on your face at my this past week my onco and i just discussed my therapy thanks to my meticulous record keeping we know exactly how long been on each drug since my side effects are tolerable stay on anastrozole for a full 5y altogether depending on what the latest research is at that have 2y remaining out of the 10y and how my body is longstanding osteopenia progressed into osteoporosis last year and i have since developed endometrial polyps ovarian cysts and a uterine fibroid for which i have tvus to keep an eye on things down either stay on anastrozole or switch back to tamoxifen for the remaining 2y tamoxifen is better for your bones but can increase your risk of endometrial cancers blood clots stroke cataracts etc ais arimidex anastrozole femara letrozole aromasin exemestane have lower gyn effects but are harder on your bones and cause more joint pain fatigue sleep disturbance etc this is not to say that get all or even any of those side effects those are the side effects most commonly attributed to the different therapies you and your onco need to discuss the risks and benefits of each to determine which is better for you good luck hope some of this info helps and you feel better soon tami i had cisplatin gemzar as first line tx for lung mets cisplatin is a cousin to carboplatin both drugs are the platinum family and they are apparently a very good option for soft tissue mets in my case the cisplatin was a little tough nausea fatigue but the gemzar was easy hair loss was minimal my blood counts would drop and i needed a dose reduction but otherwise very tolerable i had an excellent initial response partial to this combo for my lung mets and then they stayed stable for another couple months then it stopped workingcompletely then it was on to another chemo i also had numerous spots so surgery or rfa was not possible many people have an even better result than i did i think you will find you have success with this combo i just hope it is brutal onthose spots and that it keeps them away for a long long time joanne s i tolerate taxol am on abraxane now not bad but do have neuropathy and bone pain although neulasta might be part of the pain too anyway a shorter infusion hour vs 3 or more and tolerable side effects just finished 4 and this has been the best one just pain and fatigue no nausea which was my worst issue 47 was 34 at my first dx i just had my first tc chemo yesterday i pretreated with 4 mg of dexamethasone in the a m and p m on wednesday and on thursday in the a m took my 4mg of zofran for nausea and went for the treatment the nurse premedicated me with another 8 mg of dexamethasone and 8 mg of zofran within nine minutes of taxotere infusion i had a reaction i felt intense pressure in my chest i became very short of breath i could feel my face and neck getting flushed my husband looked a little panicked because i was bright red then i got extreme pain in my low back like a doctor was performing multiple bone marrow biopsies on each hip bone in the back i started seeing bright spots of light in my visual field i actually momentarily thought i was going to pass out and after that i had no idea what was going to happen to me it was extremely terrifiying they had to stop the taxotere and give me and give me 50 mg of benadryl and hydrocotosone we waited five or ten minutes then they ran the cytoxan which went in fine the nurse restarted the taxotere and needless to say i was extremely concerned have another reaction thank you god that i did not spend the night voiding my bladder every three hours or less last night uggh anyway one else have a reaction to the taxotere like this if so did you ever again have that reaction not a good sign when it takes 10 minutes to remember how to start a new topic also fumbling for words which is not typical for me my head is hurting so much i just keep whispering to myself stay calm stay calm i have been having really tough i thought were starting fareston on june 19th i took fareston at half dose for one week then full dose for five days before stopping because of an allergic reaction i had expected headaches with this new drug since a common side effect and that they would resolve because that had been my experience with tamoxifen these headaches have been much worse overall and have continued to worsen over the last eight days that i have been off fareston i think its half life is 5 days now i am wondering if the story i have been telling myself about the headaches and had helped me to be patient and hope for off track my head pain has been significant since friday night and i have had erratic and inadequate sleep since then the visual disturbances are vision gaps in vision occasional auras had occasional periods when i could not understand what i was reading and i could not speak my words correctly i feel like i am moving in slow motion not had any specific muscle weakness or tingling any slurring of speech any falls i talked to my rn and i have an appointment with him tomorrow i be able to see my mo until the 17th i assume i will need to get a brain mri i had one in about a year been taking tylenol 650 mg around the clock not exceeding the dosage recommended and i discovered that ativan just makes me feel worse i have thought about going to the local er but i have no faith in that process and i am trying to wait until i see my internist tomorrow i am trying not to think in catastrophic terms not to let fear get out of control i am trying to stay calm andi am hoping for support while i persevere i started on anastrozole about 2 months after mx that lasted for 6 months started on this thread on p 82 had huge food cravings especially late at night no surprise i gained 20 pounds quickly and take any of it off i have been off about weeks no cravings and weight loss of 5 pounds in the last couple weeks and activity has been relatively low since revision surgery beginning of july i go back to mo on monday have my list of questions but i feel like stepping into the unknown where have you others gone after taken off of anastrozole and what are some of the also what are some of the questions i should ask that not aware of yet thanks so much really appreciate all your insights and advice hi sylvia all the gang just popping in to say hello all good here thank god 10th of 12 taxol tx tomorrow thank goodness i still feel practically normal on it not as fatigued as i was either as i have started walking again and the fresh air is wonderful although it is so cold today that i be taking emma out in it the fog is on the ground i am so looking forward to finishing chemo be so great to not be pumped with drugs every week reading a lot of posts about vit d metformin wonder should i speak to my onc about this in a few wks time i take my anastrozole just before bed it has not affected my sleep but then i had problems withsleep anyways even before bc it gotten any worse 2 advil work my are still minimal and not much different than from before going on anastrozole joint pains are the same as before and ruthbru is correct to say keep moving i hurt more when i just on the couch for a long time ratherthan when moving around only se noticed is my hair thinning my dil is a hair dresser and she said she noticed it also so she has been making sure i take better care of it for now with the right shampoo conditioners she also does a deep conditioner every time she cuts or colors my hair

now that i have started eating better no junk food and lost weight since august rads one of the selisted isweight gain but had just the opposite i really complain and hope that we are not scaring any newbies that this drug is all doom and gloom it does havesisters like me that are doing well and any se are out weighed by the benefits not trying to minimize se out there just wanted to let the lurkers know that there arewomen like methat have problems with this drug i reallyhope everyone with problems onanastrozole can find a balance with the meds and improve their daily lives kitty on taxol and avasin and had a little bit of neuropathy in my feet it started out with the burning and tingling but actually has gotten better and bother me much now i am also in a church choir and have had some issues with my voice my voice is usually hoarse for a few days following chemo but gets better after that i thought it was the avastin because hoarseness was listed as a possible side effect but maybe the taxol i guess find out when i go on avastin w o taxol i do love singing and i want to have to give that up just yet i can deal with these side effects so far because as you say it sure beats the alternative beth hi maureen and welcome i had ac too but not t lost my hair like everyone does but it came back just fine kytril and emend kept the nausea away and i was weak emotional and sleepy most of the time i was on chemo i guess it affects us all differently i hope you will let us help where we can hugs g susan i hope the 9th comes quickly so you can get some good news hug emily i flew home to ny for xmas and all the crazy italian food made me your swelling be all the rich food over the holidays ann i swear the last three taxols were exhausting the steroids just bloated me beyond belief i take 2 advil for pain when my legs hurt some days i tire so easily and some days i can go all day long its just hit or miss i believe i made it to midnight on nye my fatigue is from radiation i just finished the miaderm works great so far no redness i had my appointment with the hair extension lady and everything is on schedule for may my eyebrows literally just showed up yesterday eyelashes are coming in too the hair on my head is long on the sides and shorter on top i should post a pic almost ready to kick the wigs to the curb peace and health to all in 2013 exhaustion fatigue does not hit everyone doing rads i felt better every day while doing rads 12 weekly taxol had me dealing with complete utter exhaustion fatigue i started rads a week after last taxol and only felt better every day by the time i was done with rads i was very close to being back to myself energy wise as i have said after rads i burned very bad but i never experienced fatigue during those healing months there is no one set of rules that all of our bodies follow or that we follow winyan the power within susan i had a parathyroidectomy also which is probably what caused my osteoporosis as well i quit fosamax after 3 years due to the fact that i had had a hip fracture and was beginning to get jaw pain i did not want to take aromasin due to possible further damage but did give it try for a few months the osteoporosis got worse since i had many other sez from aromasin eg constant diarrrhea severe bone and muscle pain some days i literally could not walk i quit the drug the parathyroid was diagnosed thru high calcium level on a blood test a 24 hour urine test and then a scan of the parathyroid gland prior to the diagnosis i had no idea i was losing calcium but had had some bone ache thought it was just old age thanks so much for all the encouragement ladies means so much to me and i feel better today we might even go out for breakfast brunch crazy jenn i chuckled when i read your post not because funny in the least but because i can relate so much last year on this date i was watching my oldest graduate from college i was so proud so happy now i feel like sh t most days and look like uncle fester with a case of leprosy but yes right we can do this damn it angie been on ativan for a while now i tend to have bouts of anxiety anyway and this has just quadrupled it the bonus is it typically helps with my nausea not the ac nausea come to find out but i still take it every day for the effects nancy i just want to give you a hug and right there with you i live in yoga pants for all the reasons you mentioned i am surprised that the surgeon mark where where your bra straps hit though mine did so i have that problem only one out of how many happy day hugs to all games yes they can be enticing i occasionally dabble in freecell card game what kind of painting do you do the bursitis they now tell me is actually frozen shoulder or was it bursitis that progressed to frozen shoulder all i know is i am in constant pain and it is making my life miserable the hot flashes from arimidex lupron are the frosting on the cake they gave me a steroid shot the other day and it has helped somewhat but i still have a long way to go what kind of neuropathy do you have when i did taxol it gave me lots of pain in my ankles and lower legs i see you were diagnosed in 2007 have you had the neuropathy ever since then is there any treatment for it lisa i am also an ilc survivor the waiting for the results is always the worst i ended up with 6 biopsies because the mri finds a lot of stuff 3 of the 6 were cancer i had a partial mastectomy my oncotype was low so no chemo here but i did have 7 nodes removed i just read about a new term post mastectomy pain syndrome yes that is me no lymphadema but other stuff that was described exactly as i have experienced it i was just diagnosed in february surgery in april rads in summer i feel good now i think i would ever feel good again but i do and you will too i am on tamoxifen and it has been pretty easy too willl be happy to talk to you anytime hang in there i also agree with some meds for the anxiety it does help i have a 10 year old daughter too i had 4 rounds of a c and 6 of taxol triple negative so just radiation taxol was really tough for me but i was warned about most possibilities i was wiped out my hands and feet and other parts hurt i did not shower and brush my teeth some days too fatigued so i bugged my doctor and made some er trips but we did get me on a good pain protocol for bone pain neurontin for neuropathy and i took meals from my church group and cleaning for a reason housekeepers came to clean my house every other week what a relief to not have to look at a crummy kitchen while feeling like crap bless them the day after my last taxol i was still tired but i was not hurting so i had my boyfriend take me sledding it took forever to walk up the hill but it hurt the slow walk up was worth the fast and exhilerating ride down and the laughter it was my way of reclaiming my life i had doxorubicin cyclophosphamide and avastin in a clinical trial the avastin may turn out to be a placebo know until the end of treatment in january every 2 weeks for 4 treatments weeks the nausea meds i had helped a lot especially emend which is a onceday pill i also had zofran and compazine for nausea the zofran gave me headaches the first treatment so i stopped taking that and the emend and compazine took care ofthe nausea diarrhea was pretty constant but when it got too bad i took immodium and that helped bad sore throat most of the time but i felt pretty good other than that just tired but no big problems i hope your mom feels better soon oh i hear you they only added 1 extra session to mine 21 instead of 20 and i wanted to cry i ended up doing 2 in one day to make up so i could still finish on the same day because we were moving the very next day my skin is so fried 8 days out and still it is painful weeping and raw my underarm is better this is such a nightmare i fully did not understand the amount of burn damage i would have after rads were over cry i do feel like i am on the up swing and things are slowly getting better my ro said to wait a month after rads before starting tamoxifen not sure why but not complaining i am starting to feel depression about this whole thing like now that treatment is over and so badly burned i feel like all of this is real and starting to stress about my future health a little i feel bloated and fat and need to work out but i hurt so bad that happening until all of this sucks venting here help we just moved across country have no furniture until monday are are sleeping on air mattresses on the floor so sorry feeling down edi i hope everything will go well tomorrow and that things will look brighter again it was so sweet that your gd came to wake you up so you could begin your day together and sounds like you had a lovely time btw i never realized a scouse was a stew but right what i made was essentially a scouse plus red wine good thread morwenna re life after treatment oh and beautiful tree too like you and others have expressed every pain and twinge causes me to panic the discomfort in my buttock that comes and goes my major worry a recent stitch in my side that lasted about a week last week nausea while at the gym feeling more out of puff than usual while walking sudden bruising on my foot and legs and on it goes seems something new every week i work myself up into a compulsive frenzy with consulting dr google and reading threads on here but then get to the point where i just have to let it go because it wears me out my mum is always very good re helping me adjust my attitude also trying to follow advice from nihahi and those on other threads to along the lines of what you were saying find some things to look forward to in the near term like making plans to do things with dh i know enjoy establish some goals re diet exercise well being and keep the anxiety re what the future might hold in check websister i hope your stamina builds and that you continue to make progress re your work schedule my fatigue seems to operate at a larger scale more like good weeks and bad weeks in early november i actually felt at least as good as i did a year ago prior to diagnosis last week all i wanted to do when i got home from work was crawl into bed and wondered how i was possibly going to last until friday evening well ladies i hope this week is a good one for all of us time for some sleep if i can manage to cool off from this internal heat wave sorry you are struggling with this it fun is it not tn either i found that it so much the taxol that gave me bone pain it was the neulasta shot i get the shot until 48 hours after the taxol and for those 48 hours i was fine no side effects whatsoever then get the shot and within 24 hours be for days it felt like my bones were made of napalm nothing helped i had to grit my teeth hang on for dear life and wait for day 4 when i knew the pain would start to scale back and i could feel somewhat normal again as for the neuropathy i have too many issues with my hands but my feet toes were problematic and i lost a few toenails which have since grown back and today are painted screaming red my mo said that it could last for up to a year following treatment however i found that when i started hiking biking again the lingering neuropathy cleared very quickly within days i noticed that it has subsided completely when i broached the subject with the oncology nurse she said that it was possible that the exercise increased my circulation which in turn helped sweep out the drug deposits in my toes that were responsible for the neuropathy i think lou 10 has a good suggestion see if a lowered dose is an option for you and if so try it perhaps you will be able to see this through to the end just checking in congrats to the ladies who have finished chemo i started taxol monday so far no crazy nausea which has been a blessing mostly tired and i have some tingling in my fingers and toes eleven more hoping it goes by quickly hi everyone well round 3 really knocked me down i hate what the chemo does to us both physically and mentally emotionally i am lucky in that i have a great support system but there were times this last weekend that i was positive i going to do 4 then i remember how many of you have done much much more than this and i just need to suck it up and get through it with the feb fighters i will i had an episode of lymphedema a couple weeks ago i went for a massage and conveniently forgot to remind her not to touch my left arm i finally see a physical therapist tomorrow about this let you know what i learn gotten a lot better but today my arm is sore and tight grrr mad at myself for this the itching i asked about went away when i remember to take my final dose of steroids and i have been taking claritin or benedryl to help with the itching as i guess an allergic reaction to the taxotere my fingertips are really sore today and i noticed some discoloration along all the nail beds that are growing out like a bruise but in a line tonight i am going to the acs look good feel better class i am taking some scarves with me so i can learn how to tie them i do have some hair growing back but really sparse and sticks straight out since about of an inch long take care all hugs nolana i went on effexor to control hot flashes i was on celexa before i hated how it made me feel and it did nothing to help my hot flashes however it was a b h to get off of it i had the worst withdrawal effects i have ever had in my life i wanted to commit myself now off all after being on them for ten years add to that tamoxifen which also causes depression i have felt suicidal the last 3 days with some crazy family issues involved as well i have been taking 5 htp but not cutting the mustard how can i get off all this stuff and feel better mentally it seems crazy to go through all of this malignant melanoma followed by stage 3 bc only to feel like ending it all having such a tough time 6 months after treatment did you all feel worse as time went on how do i try to tell my family what feeling les ladies i been on since my surgery on the 7th not sure if i told this group but my te sprung a leak as i was at my full fill level the ps said just get you in for your exchange well the hospital get my ps an or for me for 3 weeks when he did the surgery the muscle had pulled the area back and he had to put another te in he was able to fill it to 420cc s so i will only need another fills to get it back to 650 but i have to wait 3 months for the next surgery due to insurance he did get the implant in on the left and did lots of fat grafting ouch today is 3 weeks so i was able to get the drain out although it is still quite productive 50 glad it is out box i love your hair i too have always had long but i decided when i turned 30 19 years ago that i wanted to see what short was like mine was very similar to yours it looks great mine is about 1 all over and black and white gray been dying it brown for 20 years and knew i was graying but was not expecting the black it totally throws my coloring off and since tamoxifen losing eyebrows and eye lashes i had to go buy black eyeliner brown look right but if i wear my wig which is brown i use the brown nancy i too like my short hair and grew it back now i have straight cancer hair i have never had straight hair in my life i have no idea what to do with it i either feel like a guy or like i stuck my finger in an outlet as it is straight and sticks straight up i find if very depressing so odd we have won the battle with cancer yet it is our haircoyote woo hoo on the pet the you need to enjoy your life talk as in get your things in order wow so glad you had an apt with your mo after i have a friend who just passed away from an intestinal issue so not bc and not kidneys who was on dialysis for years it cramped her style having to go all the time but she continued on with her life even went on a cruise who knew there were dialysis machines on cruise ships but like you the no tomato rule nearly did her in every so often she would just say gonna go one day might as well be from eating a tomato fortunately she diabetic so have that additional constraint to her diet as to sunny each day will get better but it is awful in the beginning sending loving hugs can they do dialysis through your chemo port also were your kidney numbers off during chemo so were you expecting this elaine so nice of you to think of me during my days off the boards puffin i did that cruise with my parents 15 years ago we went the last week of july and i think you had warmer temps glad the mammo was clean kidney issue what i thought that was coyote is it both of you hair how oh how are we supposed to shave these numb caverns called arm pits and except for loosing eyebrows eye lashes and maybe some hair above my upper lip all areas that need to be shaved need to be shaved that is the only reason glad still not allowed to swim no need to shave the bikini area and yes i did as i historically have done i opened a word file and composed my message while catching up with your posts from the last 4 weeks hope you guys all continue to improve btw i found my cancer 1 year and 5 days ago so odd my last chemo was march 13 last night while rubbing lotion on my hands i freaked out and noticed 3 nails were turning white one is white and the other 2 are white on the ends of the nail upon further investigation i found out it is a s e of our beloved taxotere and it means my nails will probably fall off the one that is white can be lifted what the heck my hair is growing back but now i will have bald fingers my fingers are sore and were sore on chemo did this happen to anyone else also saw a lymphedema pt and i loved going she gave me exercises to get rom back in my affected arm she massaged everything my chest and arm and it felt good i still have tightcording so i need to go back final chemo was yesterday with my taxotere reduced by 25 due to neuropathy concerns wondering if the reduction might make any difference with my other se anyone have any experience like this so vlad to be done going now to joyfully unpack my chemo bag i have lost almost 30 pounds i gained 35 during treatment due to swelling lack of activity etc so am just about 8 pounds form my norm on a very large frame i think its the metformin as been on tamoxifen and that causes weight gain i had barely any stomach discomfort sorry to ehar about your side effects hi all so happy to hear of all you women who are preserving your ability to have children later how wonderful to know that so many doctors are taking fertility into consideration unfortunately i was dx while pregnant with my first child so i was unable to do any fertility preservation my 3 y o daughter and i are both healthy now i am trying for another child the chemo did damage my fertility my cycles came back 7 months after stopping tamoxifen but it looks like i am not ovulating and my ovarian reserve is very very low this is my first month trying oral fertility meds fingers crossed want to overstep here and of course every situation is different but all current research shows that a pregnancy following breast cancer does not increase the chance of a recurrence let me know if you want a link to the papers that talk about it i know you have other things to take care of first good luck to you i did chemo herceptin for a 5 mm her 2 grade 1 tumor my onc was on the fence said chance of distant recurrence without the chemo herceptin the combination chemo herceptin and tamoxifen should reduce that risk to so i was game but if i have small children i probably would have passed on the chemo especially since i was grade 1 low ki 67 the thing i hate the most about chemo was the menopause if you are already in menopause from surgery then there are very few long term effects of chemo herceptin some small risk of neuropathy and heart damage but numbers are verylow good luck with your decision i must say i am very relieved that i went ahead and did it now that it is over it probably depends on whether you can get on with your life without worrying if you do the treatment noelle hello one and all thank you all for posting your experiences i started on tamoxifen at the first of this year and noticed any se until recently the fatigue has gotten really bad i have no energy or motivation to do much of anything i finally called my mo will be seeing her tomorrow i began searching for info on fatigue on this board and discovered so many others having similar symptoms that i realize could be se muscle cramps itching skin brain fog i even read posts on another thread about feeling the let down reflex in my breast years after breastfeeding completed i thought i was imagining it anyway after reading these posts i have written down all of these seemingly unrelated symptoms and will discuss them with my mo tomorrow morning thanks for sharing your experiences and encouragements it has been truly helpful to me i feel the same way i fhinished chemo oct 3rd 06 the started rads oct 16th finished them dec 4th then started tamoifen in feb 07 i think what happens is we are giving all are energy to getting through treatments and when they are done it finally hits us that we had breast cancer and our bodies are in shock after going through the treatments now we have the time to really think just what we went through also it is like you said everyone around us thinks hey you look great and your done with treatments 1 so you should be back to normal well we back to normal and never will be what we were before bc i have really started walking after treamtments but had set back from fatigue but found out my thyroid is not working i have been on synthroid for 6 days now and can already tell my energy is coming back i still have problems with my tamoxifen hot flashes leg cramp and muscle pain but they are bareable so far i still get depressed and i have a good cry once a week lol and i still have the fear of recurrance but all the ladies out there tell me that will decrease in time so i guess that is the main thing we have to do is give ourselves time to grieve for what we lost and try and start a new self hang in there and you can email me any time if you need to vent steph joan the steroidal and irreversible bit concerned me tooprior to starting aromasin i asked my good friend who is a bc onc in sweden and he told me that the chemical action of aromasin is steroidal it is not to be confused with being a steroid and the irreversible bit is something to do with the way in which the enzyme binds with the aromatase via the adrenals and prevents it from being converted into estrogen aromasin is therefore more properly called an aromatase inactivator rather than inhibitor if it were truly irreversible in its effect we would only need to take one pill and it would carry on its work as you probably know i have been very lucky in terms of lack of other than i have not experienced the usual aches and joint pains which so many of you suffer from unless you count osteoporosis which is definitely due to the ai but so far is an invisible side effect however my right wrist on the mast side of course has started giving me pain just recently i really hope this is not the beginning of cts i was supposed to finish aromasin in august as this together with tamoxifen which i took for the previous years brought me up to a total of 5 years of endocrine therapy but i was very scared to stop the onc said there was no evidence that any ai treatment beyond this point would be beneficial and wrote a letter to my pcp to this effect however either the letter did not get there or they have not bothered to read it since i am still able to get my repeat prescription for aromasin so far i have enough to last til february and plan on taking it as long as they continue to prescribe it i do wonder if i am being foolhardy since there may well be unknown late side effects of continuing beyond the five years this game is all a and we and the oncs too i suspect do not really know what the best course of action is sam like to join the train too been on tamoxifen since may 07 and noticed any major side effects i have hot flashes but had them while doing chemo taking effexor for anxiety and depression which does help with the hot flashes the only thing i have noticed but forgot to talk to my onc is that my fingertips on both hands get numb during the night while sleeping i thought it was taxol but have talked with another bc sister who do chemo and she has had the same side effect anybody else cathy twink i had hand foot syndrome with a c my feet hurt so much to just walk my hands hurt too they are now peeling my doctor say anything about hand foot syndrome with taxol in fact he said it should get better on taxol of course he said the nail thing and neuropathy would probably happen teresa mom 2acat i have finished my first month of 6 of cmf daily cytoxan pills and weekly infusions of mf been pretty lucky with side effects the worst has been stomach cramping on and off all the time i any of the watery eye thing yet i wanted to tell you that the first two weeks i felt so bloated and my stomach was so crampy that i found it difficult to eat we tried a couple of changes to my meds but the thing that got rid of the bloating i think was to stop taking my iron supplements i have very low feretin and was taking two iron pills every night along with 2 senna s to help with constipation issues that come from the iron and zofran my med dropping the iron seemed to help with the bloating and now trying soemthing other than senna s to get rid of the cramping my onc and his nurse have been very about trying to reduce the discomfort even though told them over and over again that totally tolerable i hate to even complain about it when i see what women taking other chemo meds have to go through i hope everyone has an enjoyable weekend hunkydory the fish test is the more conclusive test for the her 2 status the other is some dye or stain which i believe is quicker but may be less reliable kking my tx continues because i started with 4 dd of ac which i just finished now i move on to 12 wkly tx of taxol herceptin then herceptin continues til been on it for a year which is standard for anyone her 2 bonnie on the exact treatment plan that i am just a couple of months or so behind i just had my 4th final ac tx on tuesday scheduled to start taxol herceptin on june 10th for 12 wkly tx going for a muga scan on june 2nd this coming monday to make sure my heart is still ok for the herceptin since both adriamycin herceptin can damage the heart muscle be going for periodic muga scans while on the herceptin too ac can be very rough on some people but i was very fortunate with minimal had no nausea other than the emend decadron plus the aloxi they put in my iv on tx day rarely taken any other meds my digestive system has been pretty cooperative in other ways too i e minimal constipation or diarrhea my appetite has been pretty decent although my sense of taste is often dull or just off hopefully sail through this as smoothly as i have you get pregneant while on tamoxifen but it does not bring on early menopause it might make your periods irregular but the hormone stuff keeps going the drug just protects your breast cells from the effects of estrogen not to sound like your mother but if you want children you should be making plans to have them even absent a breast cancer risk fertility past 35 declines greatly just because most women go into menopause until 50 mean that they can easily concieve until then always free to not take your recommendations he she is just reading you the party line hi kinden with my primary dx i was on zoladex and tamoxifen at age 41 i had terrible hot flushes menopausal symptoms etc for the 1st 12 months at least then they eased off for the next 12 months i then stopped having zoladex as the recommended 2 years post dx treatment time was up but stayed on tam for the next 3 years i felt alot better when i had finished zoladex no where near as achey and definitely no noticeable hot flushes however my periods had returned so that surprising i have since developed secondaries and after chemo i definitely wanted to get rid of all this oestrogen and also tam had stopped working for me i was initially on zoladex for a few months whilst taking femara and then had ovary ablation as an operation general anaesthetic recommended for me at the time since then i have changed to a different ai but again only down to some complication with femara rather than anything else i certainly feel fine on arimidex no worse than when on tamoxifen and have not had any of the awful i had during my 1st menopause however i am now 48 so rather nearer my natural menopausal age than 1st time around i feel a bit creaky as can be expected losing oestrogen production but take starflower oil and glucosamine which help nicky hi gals these pages are moving really quick i have been on the tamoxtrain since may my biggest issues are dryness and insomnia one of the doctors told me that it was ok to take benadryl i take 50 mg each night and i sleep about 5 hours if i got to bed about minutes after taking it i usually go to sleep but there are times when i run into overdrive and up all night i am going to look into the glycine just wondering i thought i read something about benadryl working against tamoxifen any thoughts have a great saturday kathy hi i started tamoxifen in sept the only symptom had are joint pains mostly in my knees and menses two weeks apart the joint pain does not happen every day right now i have a cold so guessing this is making my knee pain worse i hope you all have a blessed holiday season hey jenc with taxol my gums and teeth got sore still having issues w hot food and been done w chemo for 6 weeks got some fluffy white hair sprouts i want the real hair to show up went to a lymphodema consult today i have to wear a compression sleeve for 3 months sucks because training for a century bike ride in october that sleeve is going to be hot out on the road gotta lose that six pounds one way or another 1 week after the bike ride going for the reconstruction decided to give up the other boob at least have a matched set hopefully i went to my doctor appointment today my chemo is now officially done unless the neuropathy i have reverses itself in the next week the doctor said my neuropathy would become permanent if we continued to push taxol currently my foot bottoms are numb i feel nothing on them my fingers are tingling and feel numb like they are covered by thin cloth i guess i am supposed to be happy but it scares me to end chemo early my doc says that my stats are a 100 certain the neuropathy will become worse and permanent vs a 2 chance of recurrance which could happen i am of course paraphrasing my tongue is still feeling burned and tastes are transformed into unpleasant tastes i actually lost 8 pounds in the last 2 weeks i wonder if this is part of neuropathy i also got a uti yesterday i thought i felt unwell and then i found out why the doc says i will get stronger feel better as i move farther away from chemo i can hardly walk across a rom withour feeling winded i will begin radiation in january my mind is just not settled around this i had been prepared to do anything they said to tough it out now i am told to stop that is a big shift of gearse verything has been about chemo and now it hugs to all of you ginger hi everyone a hardy that sucks my bitch for the day i started taking femara a couple of weeks ago after ditching arimidex took it for 2 years and quit arimidex because of joint aches pains maybe a coincidence but i think the femara is causing my insomnia to rear ugly head been a insomniac for years but recently got it under control with rozerem can i take anymore drugs for sake i am hoping the insomnia will work itself out and go away but ithas juststarted back up since the femara i was so sleepy yesterday after several nights of sleeping only a couple of hours i almost fell asleep driving home from work i actually drove off the road nothing like that to jolt you awake quickly shit the bed fred donna i am so glad to see that so many of you able to help eachother out with the chemo aspect although i did the tch and herceptin i really remember a lot of the details so i am fairly useless so see ladies this does all eventually fade to a distant memory munny some advice about the tamoxifen read the threads on here about it serious just do it lol i refused tam the first time because i had some miserable side effects within the first 6 days and then quit it after 9 days i had read all the threads about it and i was so scared of the side effects and so certain that i would get them i think i actually ended up manifesting those side effects this time around the tam is my only option for tx so i every time i take a pill i tell myself how good it is for me and how much i love taking it and how going to save my life corny but hey 6 wks in and have had no problems and i stear clear of the tam threads as for me headed back to surgery tomorrow i developed an infection in the left side just yesterday and my ps wants to have a look around and see if he can save my so discouraged and so sick of feeling sick my dad and step mom had to come over and clean for me today and now going to be stuck taking care of my boys for the good part of the week just so tired of being a burdon to people and not being able to do things on my own or get out and enjoy this beautiful weather sorry to be such a downer usually very optimistic but deemed today wallow in self pity day tomorrow i will pick myself up and dust myself off and carry on wtaylor i had both aloxi emend premeds for nausea also had a big old bag of dexamethasone before the taxotere started i have to say i never had any nausea killer indigestion though used prilosec for that also er pr her 2 candyb definitely get the 2nd opinion whether or not the 2nd onc recommends the same thing you will almost certainly get some new info that is somehow helpful my diagnosis was almost identical to yours not surprisingly the recommendation of 2 oncs was the same no chemo yes tamoxifen i had a single mx no radiation an interesting thing the 2nd onc told me is that regular chemos are better for fast growing tumors e g high proliferation scores while tamoxifen is better for slow growing tumors e g low proliferation scores only er ones obviously why you take regular chemos for a short period the actively growing and dies quickly when it hits the right stage of the and tamoxifen for a long period the cells are dividing only very slowly so you have to starve them of estrogen for a long time before they die made sense to me i have a biomed research background and made me more willing to take the tamox she was also the one who said look give it a try for a few months and see how you do and if miserable we reconsider made me realize that i could change my mind and that the docs were open to that too and that also made me more comfortable to try it i have and my ses lasted a couple three months and are now mostly gone 5 months in so do you have other choices well yes you no tamoxifen is the most obvious another that they usually push for premenopausal women unless tamoxses are intolerableis or removal plus an aromatase inhibitor e g essentially they make you and then suppress the rest of your estrogen production by the adrenals like they do for the postmeno women obviously this is pretty drastic in comparison to tamoxifen then evista as the other gal mentioned in addition you have choices in your lifestyle what you eat how much you exercise how social you are what you drink etc etc these do have real effects on recurrances of cancer see the book by for a scientifically based evaluation of the other ways we can affect our outcomes i should get commissions on that book for all the times recommended it just close by noting that many many women do fine on tamoxifen i know there are many on this thread with real issues and i want to deny that reality but also many who so be scared off by worry about what might happen do remember that while the list of potential ses is long the of people who get most of them is small to extremely small w the exception of hot flashes that is high for me the decision was a balance of possible benefit compared to potential but unknown at the time ses plus whether i could live w myself if i had a recurrance and taken it have to decide what factors are important to you best of luck with your decision cologal hopefully no other shoe will drop thanks for sharing your experience i also got the big vit d doses i get the boost you did though i think my fingernails are growing faster though cs been quite a while since posted an update been trying to keep up on reading this thread and a few others but just been very busy and kept putting off posting i finished chemo on thursday the 10th i like many others in june did dose dense ac t i gave myself neupogen injections on days i feel a bit guilty because i have had a relatively easy time of it much easier than many of you i have been able to keep on working housecleaning for others part time throughout my treatment i did have lots of side effects but none of them were debilitating all were more or less manageable i also found ac quite a bit harder than taxol i had no nausea with the taxol and other than the neupogen injections take any other medications after the infusions the benedryl they gave me for 50 mg each time for taxol really made me feel awful it made my head really fuzzy and i could hardly talk i usually had a nice nap for one to 2 hours during my 3 hour drip luckily by the time the taxol was done the effects from the benedryl had mostly worn off and i was ok to drive myself home dh was in another vehicle and usually driving behind me in case i had any trouble and dd was riding shotgun the steroids dexamethasone 20 mg did make it hard to sleep the first night but it was ok because i usually had the day after treatment off my worst side effect by far was one that been told very common for my chemo combo hand foot syndrome it first hit me after my 3rd ac my hands and feet mostly my feet on ac 3 got swollen my palms and the soles of my feet turned red like a sunburn and there was some tingling and quite a bit of pain i realize what the se was at first and so for a couple of days walking was quite painful the swelling made my shoes that are usually pretty roomy very tight luckily i wear slippers most of the day at home and while working and my feet were tolerable in slippers once i realized it was hand foot syndrome i started applying lotion to my hands and feet several times per day and it got better i also started icing my feet during ac 4 and they were much better during that cycle my hands got hit really hard with the se after taxol 1 even though i used the frozen gel mittens they had at the treatment centre part of the time the gel mitts were soooo cold that i had to take my hands out for a few minutes a couple of times at the beginning the cold however only lasted about 45 minutes during the rest of the infusion my hands were at room temperature it was hot outside during the drive home and i think having my hands on the hot steering wheel may have made things worse my hands got really painful and angry red then after a few days they started peeling mostly at my calloused areas there were a couple of iterations of peeling even though i was keeping up on the moisturizing lotion many times a day i made some modifications to try to keep things from getting as bad during the last 3 taxol infusions and they must have helped because my hands and feet have been much better i used a zippered cooler bag that as just big enough to fit my feet and packed it with blue ice and zipped my feet into it during the whole infusion i used the frozen gel mittens with some thin knit gloves under them for the first minutes then without the knit gloves until they were no longer cold after that i held a piece of blue ice from the cooler bag between my hands for the remainder of the treatment me during t 2 with my whole silly looking i also started wearing my bicycle gloves which have some padded leather in the palm area whenever i did anything that might put heat or pressure on my palms such as driving riding my bike vacuuming etc also i made sure to apply fresh lotion each time after getting my hands wet now the end of day 3 and my hands and feet are doing good i seem to have had quite a bit of energy today even though just a couple of days after my last treatment not sure whether a result of finally being done with chemo or whether the fatigue been feeling was mostly still residual fatigue from the ac and finally wearing off i did notice less fatigue from the taxol anyway i spent the day being quite productive i finished a batch of plum jam that i started yesterday i spent a couple hours picking pears i did a few loads of laundry some dishes and general cleaning and i made a tomato pie thanks march chemo thread i hope the energy continues and i get back to feeling mostly normal again soon in time for radiation which i start on october 7th i wish all of you who have treatments left minimal side effects and no complications i have been taking tamoxifen for two months after the first week it felt like i had a lump in my throat it does get to the point that i feel a bit hoarse they tell me it has nothing to do with the tamoxefen but after reading your article and others thinking it is a side effect my onc gave me anxiety pills but they have been no help anyone have an answer lizzyanne thanks for passing on what your rads onc good luck with the second opinion hope it works out for youre hair growth my hair continued to sprout during taxol so my fuzz is now about cm long but the taxol also made it continue to fall out so when i run a lint roller over my head it gets covered in quite long fuzz hairs still my eyelashes have also been growing back during taxol but they are almost white so even though they are quite long already you actually see them unless looking for them like i am now thinking about the next stage in this journey i have surgery scheduled for november 14 my bs wants to try to do a lumpectomy the tumor is right behind the nipple but if he get clean margins then have to get the nipple removed in an additional surgery what worries me apart from losing the nipple and having to have an additional surgery is that presumably rads will be postponed because of the second surgery anyone else been in this situation how important is it to start rads asap maybe i should just have the bigger surgery instead so i can go straight to rads debiann my mo nurse suggested i use tea tree oil for my hands taxotere has really done a number on my hands it makes me smell like a pine forest so i quit using it she also suggested udderly smooth and been using that on my hands and feet and working pretty well had trouble with my nails and hope i hi dawnv another michigander i live up north but a downstater born and raised i went to u ofm last month for a second opinion i too was ned for 7yrs in may i had extreme back pain had an mri and sure enough mets it was detected in bone marrow and i started on abraxane a gentler form of taxol and gemzar it was not to difficult and i lose all my hair just extremely thin unfortunately it failed then on to ixempra which corrected i am now on arimidex but know for how long as a dec pet ct scan showed progression to bones and liver the onc still prescribed the ai even knowing this anyways i think its progressed to abdomen as having some issues there guess know soon enough next appt is early feb the combo stated above really was quite tolerable mainly fatigue but i think whatever we are on fatigue is se good luck count me in on thelobular thread 30debbie how are you feeling today thinking of you mrsb i had a terrible time with ac vomiting taxol has been much better really the only s e experienced after 3 weeks is a sore tongue and some nose bleeding slight no nueropathy or muscle bone aches also a slightly altered taste for 2 days a week hope it goes as well for you i realize the neuropathy can come at any time but so far so so sorry having to face this again maybe this time around get it right hang in there you are so strong read many of your posts joni hi all thanks for the tips on the aquaphor and the balm i checked out the aquaphor at the cvs today and its only listed ingredient is petroleum 41 it list the rest of the ingredients i looked at vasoline and its 100 petrolem so sticking with the vasoline my hands are starting to heal between the vasoline topical antibiotics and lubriderm finally getting better so sticking with the routine been using altho i appreciate knowing what everyone else is using been taking preventative measures with my feet and dry but not cracked also stopped using the i think that was really drying out my hands had my second of 12 dose of taxol yesterday and asked the doc about the neuropathy the tingling hands and feet are the major concern and she also told me that they adjust the dosage if the neuropathy becomes a problem so hoping for little to no of this se because i want to be done asap as well i was also hoping for a steroid high today but get it i think because i am also moderately anemic blood count they gave me an bag of iron with the infusions yesterday to boost my iron count i went out today and bought liver chicken livers and liverwurst dark green leafy veggies like spinach and more eggs egg yolks have iron and what be eating all week yummy it just figures that it be cured by something like chocolate and red wine if i get down to 8 points severe anemia they will insist on a blood transfusion and not hoping for that any of you experiencing anema if so what are you doing about it my doc give me procrit because she says some research has shown it can work against the chemo and going for curative so anything that might impact a cure is out plus she leaked that she thought my research drug was not the placebo because my urines are showing proteins a sign of avastin that was happy news as much as i can throw against this cancer to prevent recurrence the better know in 5 more weeks when they unveil my study if been getting the avastin or a placebo avastin causes fatique and anemia as well although quite frankly i can no longer figure out coming from where i had the lumpectomy and not the mastectomy on the one hand glad that i have to think about reconstruction that you all have been discussin on the other hand now pretty worried about a recurrence in the other breast and going through all this again the reality right now is i have a left d cup boob and a boob feeling pretty lopsided and heard that radiation shrinks the boob even more my husband gave me a victoria secret gift card to go get new bras however figuring that secret exactly have the bras be needing see bald shrinking eyelashes and eyebrows dry hands and feet black fingernails and toenails mismatched boobs yes feeling quite sexy these days hugs to all pat i had my left breast removed on nov 8th 2012 had a heart attack when surgery was being done the attack is one that will repair it self with time thank goodness and mostly my creator then i had a awful time healing a hematoma for 9 weeks my oncolagist recommed 12 chemo treatment my cancer was the size of a 50 cent piece out of 11 nodes one came back positive refused chemo now the 12 week window has passed and chemo now would be no use my doctor then said my mortality rate within the next 10 years was 30 of the cancer recurring 68 do not want alot more pain would like some quality time so refusing letrazole to i have severe artheritis heard the letrazole is bad for joint pain blood clots weight gain and many more side effects what asking here is for other people opinions still trying to make up mind about antiestrogen blockers thanks for reading this god bless i hope this bad but i was overwhelmed with almost posts about hair starting in 2008 i scanned for about 30 min and find the answers i wanted if wrong in starting a new topic mods please move this post to the hair hair hair topic i am almost 2 mos out of chemo with my last having taxotere due to a reaction to the adriamycin my hair is starting to grow back but it looks really dark like dark brown hoping just due to the fact my scalp is so light but i really want dark hair i was a strawberry blonde prior to all this and want that color back i put up with he hair loss even the brazilian part but me with brown hair ickhas anyone else had a major hair color change if so did it go back to normal i hope i offend any brunettes pupcake i was worried about losing my job so i chose to work through it even though i could have had disability through my company now 4 years later i ended up laid off anyway i swore i would never make that mistake again putting my job ahead of my health i had terrible fatigue from the radiation which seemed to last far longer than it should have another woman at the same company was encouraged by her boss to go out for surgery and not return until she was finished all of her treatments i was so jealous my boss encouraged me to work and was even proud of the fact that i did now that job hunting i have other health problems after i quit tamoxifen i ended up with severe bleeding and am now comtemplating ablation or hysterectomy and the job issue figures into it again i struggle between wanting to go out and immediatley get another job but because almost impossible to leave the house some days and i want to tell a new employer that need to take time off for surgery recovery i also think worth noting that there are some common and prescription drugs that have been shown to make tamoxifen less effective including benadryl diphenhydramine tagamet cimetidine and some not all antidepressants from the acs before cancer i used to take benadryl occasionally if i had trouble sleeping now that on tamoxifen stopped doing that and i used to take tagamet sometimes for heartburn i switched to zantac traci leanna i did have one drink when i was on ac that was over the 4th of july weekend and because i got some extra days in between the infusions then since i have started taxotere every 21 days i have had more days of feeling regular that has allowed me to have some refreshing beverages and the whole time i was on ac i wanted to get stinking drunk because i felt so bad i also understood the whole medical marijuana thing since all these chemo drugs are bad for your liver and kidneys i drink a lot but when i get one i make sure its a good one and i do only have one i have almost no tolerance for the alcohol so one gives me a buzz i was like that before bc too cheep date i love my wine but since i started chemo i cant drink it i can only taste the alcohol in it it has no taste for me and my onc told me not to eat or drink any thing that i really like during chemo because i wont like it afterward so i have tried to keep that in mind when i was on ac i keep hearing everyone say how hungry they were i understand why gaining weight you have to be kidding me how can you eat now on taxotere i can understand why like someone that has been denied food and will eat what ever i can while i can when my taste bud will let me taste things its is so good i was wondering about the shrinking of the tumor because for myself i just wanted the dang thing out of my body when i was diagnosed i was wondering how shrinking worked or what the philosophy was on it it would have driven be crazy waiting to get it out yes second guessing myself and if anyone every came up to me and asked what i would do differently i would have an answer i want to scare anyone but i also only had one nod that was enlarged when i went into surgery then they found out the whole sack under my arm was diseased so they took the whole thing during the surgery they kept removing nods till they got clean ones sending then to be analyzed during the surgery wish i would have had the te put in right away then others times glad i i do believe the ps is the one that puts them in i would go to whippetmom on the exchange page and ask get yourself into that page so you can start looking at the options i have started lurking the page but i really need to write so they will let me see the results picture page oh yea sometihing i wish someone would have told me before i had my mx is take a picture of your breasts before you have surgery so you remember what they looked like for the ps and for reconstruction just thought of something else about feeling my head before i had surgrey i would catch my self feeling my breast rubbing them like trying to make my self remember what they feel like after rads i will need some time to recoup i will do a complete search of what my options are for reconstruction i have learn a lot already on the exchange site things to look up and pages to bookmark oh yea for your tongue try sucking on some ice cubes i think freezing my tongue helps a lot this taxotere has kicked my but this time i have been really tired no new ses and the nepogen cause any new pains it was a better round but at the same time it i was more tired i was having some heart racing feeling sat but some deep breathing and relaxation techniques helped i also noticed something this time since i have been being good with my lymphedema exercises and message i noticed that not as bloated i feel as puffy but they are a pain to do twice a day but now that see results pretty excited about it wow being wordy today its think its time showered hope everyone is having a nice holiday weekend ugh been battling severe ankle leg thigh abdomen edema too i had rads to my left hip so i think that has added to the situation it was so bad i could barely walk and was very painful i think i developed cellulitis after the edema because of the pooled lymph in the lower limbs we had to drop the taxotere i was on but i think the gemzar can cause swelling too definitely ask about lasix or other diuretic pill has anyone had blood in their urine as a se from cytoxan sunday night thursday was treatment i started running a slight fever and saw a little blood in my urine it started getting worse so i called the emergency line and the mo on call prescribed me antibiotics monday morning my normal nurse saw that i called the day before and told me to come in for a urine sample i went in peed in a cup went back to work never heard anything back so i kept on taking the antibiotics luckily my hospital chain has a patient portal online and you can see all of your lab results appointments bills etc and i got a notification that my test results were up it clearly meant nothing to me but it did confirm that there was blood in my urine so i called the mo the next day tuesday and another nurse called me back to tell me that not an infection and to stop taking the antibiotics hmm ok so i asked why blood in my urine i stumped her she kept saying what i was seeing was from the adriamyacin which i knew right b c the red stuff last 3 days she then told me probably just my period um no i know not so she put me on hold and then came back saying she talked to the nurse practitioner and it seems to be from the cytoxan it can cause sepsis like symptoms including blood in the urine and to just stay hydrated still not a fan of the answer but bring it up again with my mo when i see her next week the blood has gone away completely today it seems so at least that is over with anyone else deal with this of course i googled sepsis and yeah that sound fun either only been on femara letrozole for the last 4 yrs with no issues from it i was told that its only for women who are post memopausal for a long time not ones with it during chemo i was 44 when i went through natural menopause in 1990 so i was definately a candidate for it there are potential ses with every thing but that does not mean that any of us will experience all or even any possible ones we are each unique but for myself after all i did to fight the monster all of which had potential nasty ses there is no way that i keep fighting with everything i can just how i see it not how all do winyan the power within susan i started back on tamoxifen 2 weeks ago yesterday i got so dizzy i thought i would faint never thought about that being a se of tamoxifen so if someone could elaborate on it that would be very helpful i have as much joint pain on tamoxifen as i did on arimidex so that changed hoping that my bp will drop back to normal on a regular basis and that my cholesterol will go down both of arimidex i ache from my hips down my knees hurt feel like i have shin splints i just hurt i was on tamoxifen before and switched over because of all of the aches but arimidex help that go away i am now just counting down until i can get off of it years to go hey all this just came into my inbox i signed up for oncology newsletters yes a geek i wanted to share it in case it helps someone who is not responding to antinausea meds looks like there is a new option you could ask your onc about olanzapine overcomes vomiting and nausea elsevier global medical news 2012 may 23 k wachterthe antipsychotic olanzapine trounced standard therapy for breakthrough nausea and vomiting in a clinical trial that could change the way some cancer patients are treated in the phase iii study 30 71 of 42 patients who received olanzapine zyprexa had no emesis compared with 12 32 of 38 patients who received metoclopramide p less than 01 during a 72 hour observation period after highly emetic chemotherapy in addition 28 67 patients on olanzapine had no nausea compared with nine 24 of those patients on metoclopramide p less than 01 said dr rudolph m navari who presented the study during a press briefing in advance of the annual meeting of american society of clinical oncology june in chicago dr navari is the director of the harper cancer institute at indiana university in south bend asco dr sandra m swain medical director of the cancer institute at washington hospital center called the findings a great step forward for quality of life for our patients this is a huge advance said dr swain a breast cancer expert who the teleconference come a long way to really treat and cure these patients these side effects can be intolerable to patients sometimes patients will opt out of curative treatment and we certainly want that when we know made advances the researchers included patients who received highly emetogenic chemotherapy more than 70 mg m2 cisplatin or more than 50 mg m2 doxorubicin and more than 600 mg m2 cyclophosphamide patients who developed breakthrough emesis or nausea despite prophylaxis were randomized to receive olanzapine or metoclopramide prophylaxis included intravenous dexamethasone 12 mg intravenous palonosetron mg and intravenous fosaprepitant 150 mg prophylaxis was daily oral dexamethasone mg days patients received 10 mg oral olanzapine for three days or 10 mg oral metoclopramide three times daily for three days patients were monitored for emesis and nausea for the 72 hours after the initiation of therapy in addition nausea was measured by patients on a visual analog scale with 0 being no nausea and 10 being maximal nausea patients in the two groups were similar for age sex eastern cooperative oncology group ecog performance status and diagnosis five bladder cancers 40 breast cancers eight lymphomas and 27 lung cancers both olanzapine and metoclopramide were well tolerated with no grade 3 or 4 toxicities said dr navari no central nervous system toxicities were observed in either group olanzapine is indicated for treatment of psychosis and is associated with weight gain but the side effect should not be a problem for cancer patients the side effect of weight gain occurs in patients who receive the drug for three to six to nine months dr ravari noted so using it for a short period of three to four days once a month we did not see that in the current study nor did we see that in previous studies dr navari had previously reported that patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy were about twice as likely not to experience any delayed nausea with an olanzapine regimen compared with a standard aprepitant emend regimen 68 vs 37 in a phase iii clinical trial the two regimens worked similarly well for preventing acute nausea and for preventing both acute and delayed vomiting that study found hi again sorry about the misfire earlier what i was saying was close to your age my husband and i have been trying to have a baby for several years had four miscarriages the last one in 2008 this last one sent me into the most overwhelming depression and despair i truly know if i would survive this summer i was finally starting to see light at the end of the tunnel and pulling myself out of my depression and was even looking forward to trying a new fertility treatment then the bomb hit i was told by three different doctors that i had cancer and that it was most likely invasive i knew from friends having gone through invasive cancer that this meant chemo radiation tamoxifen five years worth of induced menopause and therefore no hope of ever even trying again to have a baby thankfully my third biopsy showed that my cancer was not invasive that it was dcis so ironically i was thrilled beyond belief to be diagnosed with only dcis this meant no doctor was going to force me to do chemo targeted radiation i can handle since that affect fertility just a 6 week detour on the road to mommydom a far cry from having to wait years and that i can handle as for tamoxifen of course a personal choice but i strongly urge you do it my dcis is fueled by estrogen er so i know my doctor will try to put me on it and with your fertility history i suspect you will turn out to be er too but there are better safer ways to bring your hormones back into balance without a drug that complete shuts off all estrogen not to mention the side effects increased risk of uterine cancer etc have you checked out the alternative complementary board here yet there are some great threads about balancing hormones naturally btw conventional medicine failed me for two full years while my husband and i were ttc what worked for me was not a drug it was using natural diet lifestyle means to bring my hormones into balance i know from that experience that natural means are so much better than throwing chemical drugs at the problem interestingly find that most of the diet lifestyle change recommendations for improving fertility are the very same recommendations for fighting cancer things like drinking cups of green tea every day sleeping every night in total darkness not even a nightlight or clock radio light showing getting minutes of sunshine exposure every day when possible doing some kind of exercise every day amazing how several small changes can make you more fertile and fight cancer annnnd help with depression weight management add and who knows what else at this point as terrified as i was when i was newly diagnosed as you are i actually see this diagnosis as a blessing i was going down a road after the last miscarriage i sort of gave up and started eating junk food drinking way too much caffeine etc this was a call to get back on track with the very lifestyle changes i had to make if i ever want to become a mother so for that i am grateful this is a completely different post from the one i wrote initially but i remember what all i had typed earlier so i may add more as i think of things in short though you are going to be okay i feel so certain both of us have motherhood ahead of us what an amazing story we will have to tell later how we faced infertility and cancer and came through it with flying colors please feel free to pm me if you have any questions at all in the meantime keep your chin up dcis is really the best case scenario kind of cancer for us future moms oh i had mentioned a book that gave me a lot of encouragement called you can get pregnant over 40 naturally by sandy robertson she and her husband started ttc when she was in her late 30 s she was only able to conceive with ivf and it ended in miscarriage 6 miscarriages total then she decided to cast off modern medicine and use natural means diet lifestyle to conceive naturally she did and had her beautiful healthy daughter at age 44 see why i think hope for us marcy 4 and saralmom i too am sorry both having problems marcy i really hope they can find something that you are not allergic to that must be so frustrating i have a couple of questions for you ladies today and hoping someone can help me out is anyone taking zometa for osteoporosis prevention yet i had requested it but not sure of the side effects if any also i am suffering from annoying hot flashes and have them every hour in the night that can last up to 15 mins consequently my sleep is being disrupted constantly and i can be up for hours throwing the covers off and then putting them back on again once the heat subsides is anyone else experiencing these i am hoping that they end with the end of chemo but i hear that tamoxifen causes hot flashes too so not happy about that hi d4hope i have been on tamox for almost 3 years it will be 3 years in july i used to get charlie horses during the night in my calves but they stopped after a few months or so lately the last few months i have been having a lot of hip pain discomfort i have not really experienced any joint pain at all since being on tamox until recently i have a new memory foam mattress and still have problems with my hips bothering me during the night and being uncomfortable not sure if it is the tamoxifen causing the problems but maybe it is i see my onc in july so maybe i will bring it up to her when i see her to see what she thinks my guess is she will say it is not the tamoxifen but see i hope cutting the dose helps good luck so true lisa and for me just turned 77 aromasin was really debilitating as said before it is not natural to be drained of every drop of estrogen and i think my body actually went into a kind of shock with the horrible bone and muscle pains depression constant diarrhea dizziness increased atrial fibrillation etc so after reading the study about women over 70 not needing an ai i was convinced to drop it since then i have broken another bone my arm not saying the ai i was on for half a year caused the bone weakening but it certainly help as some of you know i have very severe osteoporosis and have broken many bones before during and now after the aromasin this scares me more than anything mybee i hope you have a good day today those first few days can be rough take care camillegal taking the claritin to help reduce inflammation i had forgotten about it but i was told by my nurse navigator to take it when i had taxol if i got joint pain beau mentioned it here so i decided to try it fondak taking the 24 hour claritin so just one a day shayne maybe you can just try taking aromasin for awhile if worried about the steroidal part of aromasin maybe your doctor could put you on femara or arimidex instead maryny my hot flashes were exactly the opposite on tamoxifen i called them my tsunami hot flashes because they were drenching they were super intense and lasted about 5 minutes each when i started the aromasin i had a lot more flashes but they were milder and short it still amazes me how differently we all react to these drugs i do think things change with time on this drug i say it all settled down after six weeks but at least i knew by then that i could handle it for anyone dealing with joint pain i was told motion is lotion for the joints so even when they hurt a lot i still did easy exercises like walking and stretching and it did help relieve the stiffness all kind of trial and error to find what works for you jdpeaches hi sorry you had to join but welcome to the group club have they told you what your treatment protocol will be i know how specific i can or should be since i know what chemo be on but i can at least share with you my experience so far i was diagnosed in had surgery wide lumpectomy with axillary node dissection immediate margins were clear but my surgeon had taken a couple of extra samples they found islands of cancer cells in one of those samples so i went back early april for a wider lumpectomy my original tumor was approx 4cm x cm by 3cm give or take i remember but fell somewhere within stage 2 and i had enlarged lymph nodes in my armpit my surgeon was leaning towards a sentinel node biopsy at the time of the original lumpectomy but the oncologist radiation oncologist both of whom already met with both seemed to feel that i should just have the lymph nodes removed given the size of the tumor that the biopsy indicated my cancer is was grade 3 refers to level of cell differentiation aggressiveness with grade 3 being the poorest differentiation most aggressive plus a good friend an oncology nurse also suggested removal so what we did i had a port inserted during my 1st surgery and i strongly recommend getting one if be getting chemo for more than 4 or 6 treatments or so especially if you have weak or skinny veins my port turned out to be picky it will accept infusions without any problems but it like to give blood so had to revert to drawing blood from my arm or hand to run the labs use the port for the infusions since the needle they use to draw blood is slimmer than what have to use to place an iv working out ok most ports so picky are used both for the blood draws infusions i started chemo in 11 days after the 2nd surgery i began with 4 dd treatments of adriamycin cytoxan ac dose dense for ac anyway means treatments every 2 weeks instead of every 3 weeks it can be tougher on your body since you have less time to rebound feel better between treatments but you finish up sooner believed that dd treatments give the cancer cells less time to rebound grow back too ac is reported to be one of the toughest protocols to be on although the various drugs to deal with side effects are amazing one important note about adriamycin it can cause mouth sores many people suggest sucking on ice chips or popsicles or similar while actually getting the infusion this was recommended to me i did it for all of my adriamycin infusions i never had any mouth sores many places will provide ice chips for you some oncologists will say no conclusive evidence my advice would be that it works for so many people so do it anyway while on ac i took emend at home before treatment again the next 2 mornings i was given decadron dexamethasone a steroid plus aloxi another med by iv right before treatment i took decadron by tablet the next 3 days at home i also had prescriptions for atavan and compazine but i only took atavan once compazine only a few times during the first two cycles both can make you drowsy the atavan pretty much knocked me out left me feeling drugged for a day or so afterwards and i even need it but took it the night after my first treatment at my suggestion plus put it in the iv that morning before treatment which i requested they not do again it turned out i never needed it i was very fortunate in that i never had nausea only some moderate indigestion from time to time that were taken care of by otc meds ac as well as some of the other chemos can cause significant drops in your white blood cell wbc counts so typically patients either go back generally the day after treatment for a shot of neulasta or neupogen at home for a number of days between treatments both neulasta neupogen cause your body to produce more and both can cause bone or joint pain anywhere from severe to moderate or even i had to inject myself with neupogen for 8 days out of each 14 day cycle cycle length of time from one treatment to the next i need to tell you that i am a total wimp wuss very squeamish i did not expect to be able to give myself the shots so you can imagine how surprised more like shocked i was when i gave myself the 1st shot and not only find it painful or difficult but i hardly even felt it i was also fortunate in that i had no bone pain to speak of only 2 times when i had minor achiness which was easily managed with one dose of tylenol or aleve i finished the ac in late may was scheduled to start on taxol herceptin 2 wks later but postponed it due to my death her funeral out of town postponing it was one of my better decisions since side effects can be cumulative my worst side effect with ac was fatigue i crashed for about 10 days starting the day i returned home after my funeral that was my lowest point physically mentally emotionally at least for that length of time since this whole ordeal began so i had my first of 12 weekly treatments of taxol plus herceptin on june 9 either or both of these can cause allergic reactions so they give you benadryl by iv before they start keep in mind though that procedures vary from doctor to doctor they also had me take 20mg of decadron the night before plus another 20mg of decadron as well as zofran i forget the strength 2 hrs before my appt when everything went well they told me to drop the decadron to 8 mg each time nighttime i did that for the next couple of lowered it further to 4mg each time which is only one tablet each time so not going any lower even though i still have no reactions they also gave me 50 mg of benadryl the 1st tx in 2 increments of 25mg each once before the taxol once before the herceptin but have only given me one 25 mg dose since this is partly because on this protocol the first herceptin tx is much larger than for subsequent and partly because i had no allergic reaction taxol generally causes much less nausea than ac had no nausea only rare indigestion taxol can also cause bone or joint pain again anywhere from mild to severe and again been fortunate that so far at least had none today was my 7th tx out of 12 my worst problem continues to be fatigue but not as bad or disabling as the fatigue i felt while on ac other potential side effects include neuropathy and or hand foot syndrome neither of which have gotten me at least not yet once i finish the current 12 tx program of taxol herceptin the herceptin will drop down to once every 3 wks til been on it for a year est 09 also have radiation 33 treatments 5 days wk for almost 7 wks during which continue to get herceptin once done start on some therapy to be determined at this point which is generally taken at home for 5 yrs both adriamycin herceptin can cause heart damage so they like to give them together typically someone who gets both of these will be sent for periodic scans either an eeg or a muga scan which is more involved but is supposed to show more detail than the eeg i had a muga scan before i started chemo a 2nd muga scan after finished my ac before i started the herceptin due to have another one soon herceptin is only given to people whose cancer is her 2 positive therapies are only given to people whose cancers are estrogen or progesterone positive i happen to be which i guess is fairly unusual one very important thing to keep in mind is that each experience is different even with the same chemo same drugs to handle side effects i was terrified before i started it seemed to me that i saw so many horror stories so few reports of tolerable manageable side effects let alone reports of none that left me quite anxious find tons of support understanding encouragement here on these boards be afraid to ask questions also check out some of the other threads the road to hell and whining among them for some relief well gone on alot longer than i anticipated i hope that at least some of what rambled about is helpful to you please feel free to ask more questions either here or by private message if like take care let us know how things go for you susan laurai had 6 months on xeloda w v few side effects but progression so switched in february to gemcitabine and cisplatin main side effect is to knock my blood counts particularly platelets so i get fatigued easily i also currently take avastin for brain zometa for bones and keytruda which is an immunotherapy drug see other drugs below i know that for the next stage my onc is already considering possibly another go with cmf or enzulatimide or ibrance although not changing drugs yet hope you have a good discussion i would like to know if anyone on tamoxifen has experienced spinal joint pain iget it between the shoulder blades and also in the lower back if i press the area it is sore any comments i also have very painful thumb joints i started tamoxifen in march and although i get hours sleep a night i am tired not sure if i am heading into a depression or not as i have awful thoughts all the time that the cancer is back in some part of my body especially when i have aches and pains i would like to hear more about the se s you ladies have had on tamoxifen then maybe i can get rid of my phobia am living in west central florida anyway i was dx in aug 06 also dcis stage 0 started tamox in oct 06 i have had loads of problems with the meds over that time to present eventually i take my 20mg in half doses 10mg in the am and 10 mg in the pm one of my biggest side effects after the whole i want to jump off the roof thing that happened when i was taking the full dose at one time has been tremors we have had variations to my med cocktail since i started the tamox now i take lexapro for depression minimal dose 10mg 2x day xanax and atenolol for the tremors clonidine 2x day for the hot flashes also heard that 800 mg of vitamin e redices the hot flashes just my experience good luck cali so glad to hear you are on the mend after your nightmare of last week hang in there get lots of rest like you have a choice right you are in my thoughts and prayers this taxol really knocked me off my feet this week way more fatigue than i ever got from the a c i know if just cumulative or the taxol is just harder on me my eyes are driving me crazy always dry and burning and teary this dry cold ne weather help been doing the eyedrops but it seem to help deb i hear ya about the prying apart in the morning half the time i know if sleepy or if my eyes are just burning and making me think sleepy about the menopause i was two years into meno when i was diagnosed i was told it so bad if you were already thru meno which i think is true and my menopause was relatively symptom free no hot flashes or extreme emotions the worst of it was lack of focus and the memory thing chemo has definitely made me more and impatient more emotional and more confused so yeah some of the meno stuff i should have had has reared its ugly head and people around me are quick to let me know how much changed that sweet of them actually that kinda hurts i think i have a good excuse i did get out to dinner with my friend last night which was nice thinking it may be better to force ourselves out as much as we can tolerate just to get away from our thoughts going to try to take a walk today on the beach since the temp is up to 34 instead of 15 with a wind chill of 2 kristi and cali wish i could transport myself to san diego for a while although the snow is pretty take care judy i am staying tuned for at least some good news to come in from all the people waiting for scan results the worst is when they have you go through the diagnostic test and still end up stumped so hope that 1 b c is not involved in anyway and 2 that something does get determined and they can start easing the pain back pain is i think you have tried effexor you but you like it neurontin is another for neuropathy but chemically it is in the class of effexor works for my neuropathy as well as the cymbalta did effexor o k with tamoxifen worst side effect is dry mouth i could buy biotene mouthwash by the gallon effexor is going to be hard to do the withdrawl i can tell since i still get tingles of my neuropathy now and then i know that is still there so i will just be addicted to effexor for life all the drug treatments are nasty some barely better than the conditions they treat medicine has a lot to learn about neuropathy and chronic pain how long until there are pharmaceuticals without side effects anybody holding their breath barbe you really must expand your base of loathing my dear to include younger women and men of all ages like i do when it comes to denying you your healthcare information rules rules and more dumb rules hello ladies had my 6th taxol treatment on friday which means halfway done with 6 more to go i was so happy to have reached that milestone when my doctor said let me do a breast exam he found a ridge in the left breast the one i call the other one that he wants me to have checked out with the breast surgeon now had a weird spot in that breast always during my mammograms i have to have the left breast imaged 2 different ways i actually have to lean over the machine and dangle my breast into the plates pretty sure this is the same ridge the onc felt on friday but i have been scared to death ever since i know all my scans came back clear and the liklihood of a cancerous tumor creating itself and growing to the point where it can be felt in months while on chemo is pretty damn slim but i still had to take 1mg of lorazepam to sleep last night my appointment is at 3pm today other than that the taxol ses are the same old same old one toe on my right foot has gone numb but not painfull or annoying so i really care if that starts going on with my fingers mention it to the doctor hair is definitely growing back darkening up and really really soft my eyebrows are back eyelashes are coming in please pray for me today that the ridge the oncologist felt is just my regular fibrous breast tissue and not another form of cancer i just think i could take it if another cancer hi for those on tamoxifen the onc pa told me yesterday that she wants me to go a few more months without a period before she will switch me to femara i think it will end up being 16 to 18 months since the end of chemo without a period just fyi ginger my feet hurt when i first walk on them after sitting or being in bed and i told the onc pa about and she responded like that could be due to leftovers from the neuropathy do you have that i still have some numbness too do you belle the first taxol i woke the next day with bad tummy pain no nausea and had some constipation for a couple of days the next time i took senna when i got home and in the morning and did not have any trouble i have had heartburn so i just took prilosec 1 a day i am going to vegas for a franchise confernece for the store i own we are getting an award for having one of the highest percentage increases over last yrs sales won the same award last yr we moved to a large location in may and are doing really well good timing as my husband is in construction and his work is non existant my son has taken over the helm while i am out have not worked since diagnosis too much yucky stuff in there and sick kiddos i really miss it really excited to get that award with all that has happened this year maggie good morning i hope everyone is feeling ok i just wanted to pop in before going to rads to see how its going i had a runny nose throughout chemo once the nose hairs go there is nothing to protect the inside of your nose so it will run and not stop but it does go away after you finish chemo i also had issues with bloody nose in the evening i added a humidifier and it seemed to help if you are not feeling well take the nausea meds i would start them the morning after chemo and kept taking them as prescribed for the next 4 days you heal if you feel sick and once it starts it is hard to control so get ahead of it drink lots of water and keep drinking it everyday i still drink about 4 to 5 bottles of water a day it helps with rads also good news my hair started to grow back after the first taxol infusion i lost the eyebrows and eyelashes but they are now back and are thicker than before i take biotin for my hair and nails and seems to work for me ask the mo for the bic c i always had a big dinner the night before chemo and i took sennokot the morning of chemo again stay ahead of it the descriptions of cement and rocks very true and not so pleasant pain meds will cause it also eat lots of fresh fruit drink water and stay ahead of it once i figured it out it was fine for all the ac ladies watch the side effects shortness of breath and cough can be from the chemo heart damage a small percent of women have heart problems from it tell the mo or nurses of anything different i won the heart damage from the side effect contest i hope you all have a great weekend no appointments and time to relax and get well take care i am off to rads but i think of all of you often you got this i am so sorry for how down you are right now never been on carboplatin but sure remember that during the first bc dx adriamycin kicked my a naseau and constipation and pain from neupogen shots until i was finally done that was what kept me going it was finite of course as metsters we have that to keep us going i think you need to have time to grieve for what bc does to us whether it be been there done that too or indulging yourself as heather suggested i too wish i could come over to your home and hang out with you and help you with whatever you needed never apologize for venting what we are hear for to support our bc sisters just know everyone on this board understands exactly how you feel and hopes you can climb out of this funk soon also do ask your onc about lowering your dose sounds like it really helped other people i pray that you feel better physically and emotionally very soon hope you can feel my good vibes coming your way robin keep in mind everyone is different hopefully you experience ses and if you do they may be mild i have been on tamoxifen now for over 3 years and have learned to manage ses depending on the manufacturer my preferences are 1 mylan little or not joint pain but more hot flashes i drink a lot of ice water and use cool wraps on my neck 2 watson fewer hot flashes for me but more joint pain need to take supplements to manage this 3 teva really really bad joint pain muscle cramps and hot flashes thankfully my pharmacists has been really good at obtaining supplies from the other two so i had to take teva for quite some time if i had to take this brand for an extended period of time i would have to consider other options judi i would love the challenge am up 20 lbs also since diagnosis one year ago i have gone on a hike two days in a row now major step for me having trouble with the eating though staying with my sister and she loves the sweets well i stop dang outta control she has more self control i can eat myself silly tamoxifen makes me nauseas but all be darned if i keep munching right on through the nausea hi all my muga scan ef before chemo was very high in high 70s or low 80s i had a c neoadjuvant chemo then surgery then taxol and herceptin after taxol and radiation ended while still taking herceptin my legs and ankles swelled next muga scan showed 46ef after stopping treatment for 6 wks my next muga scan had not changed my oncologist says that i may never be able to take any chemo again my oncologist now says that i should just go back to life meanwhile i have congestive heart failure shortness of breath fatigue sleep disorders etc i also have peripheral neuropathy from the taxol that has not abated since taxol treatment stopped in march i stopped herceptin treatment the first week of june anyone know of any stats on patients that have only had 4 months of herceptin sjensen 29 i am also doing tamoxifen and zoladex i procrastinated starting both i started t in december and waited 2 months to start zoladex i had an infection and felt the last thing i needed was to begin menopause simultaneously so the first zoladex shot was a bit intimidating because the needle gauge is a bit large they numb you first and honestly i feel a thing if your skittish about needles look they told me it might take a few weeks to feel the effects 2 weeks later i noticed i felt a little dizzy lightheaded i expecting that as the nurses only warned of hot flashes my eyes feel a little dry and i started my period a little odd nice supposed to inhibit menstruation i guess the ovaries are fighting i see the onc on tues and will see what they have to say good luck to you hi divas been sitting here catching up on posts there has been a lot of activity since my last visit i had taxol 3 today only 1 more to go carie and simvog do not worry yourself too much about starting the taxol so far the worst se for me has been the body aches and they do get pretty bad at least for me but after 2 txs i think i know how i will handle it this time my onc sugguested taking advil or motrin right before the pain normally starts and take it around the clock so for me that is around day 3 the aches usually last for days i had too many issues with neuropathy i have some slight numbness in one of my toes and my tingers tingle occasionally i hope you will notice a great improvement with your taste buds and appetite i have for sure and there is no nausea which is great i started working out again too so please get too stressed out about starting i agree with everyone this cancer and chemo this really sucks really ready for it to be over too i think being able to get back into my normal routine is helping me to feel better it feels good to workout again and to be in control of things a bit more zuffa that is fantastic news i hope your news just continues to get better and better have a good evening everyone elaine menopausedoes indeed result in hair thinning for some menopause and tamoxifen therapy which may make natural thinning more noticable i know that it make it easier when leaving hair on the bathroom floor thanks rosebud sorry about the tiredness heard a problem with taxotere so tired now hard to imagine being even more so the neulasta and neupogen shots are awful they i was still having bone pain and palpitations a week after my last injection last time glad to hear that your feet and hands are okay every se we can avoid the better congratulations on being half way through the taxotere cynthia melia ditto for me on what tina said unbelievable i hope it all resolves quickly and easily for you viddie i know i have gained weight since this whole bc process began 2 years before my diagnosis i was down about 20 lbs from eating well mostly low carbs south beachish diet and exercising 4 5 x weekly at a curves type club i felt really good i mean i did not expect to be the same size as when i was newly married but then who does once you hit your late 40s i am in the same boat as you on tamoxifen and the effexor quitting the tamoxifen is out for me my onc wants me on it for 5 years then will switch me to an ai and i think i could give up the effexor as not only does it calm my anxiety it basically cleared up my hot flashes night sweats more like night drenches i am easily up 7 or 8 lbs since the summer added to the 15 i needed to lose anyways so i am hovering in the 25 lb area to lose i am really trying but this has been a difficult fall between my 50th dinners from everyone the jewish high holidays and now it seems i have a bar or bat mitzvah every weekend from now dec 7th just going to try to do the best i can and try to knock off the 7 or 8 lbs so i can go to aruba and fit into my summer clothes otherwise a big problem mary i admire you for working out 2 hours day i could never do that i have been trying to walk on my treadmill 45 minutes day at least 4x week just not fair my sil has the opposite problem she is 5 2 and maybe weighs 100lbs soaking wet she can eat whatever whenever and barely gain an ounce tina oh your jaclyn reminds me of my cassie when she was younger funny but tough as nails andbold just keep up being strict now with both her and pauly if you control them now wait until 13 14 the crap that these kids have to deal with today such peer pressure we had wet flurries here last night and again today the dh is going to put the snow tires on the cars this week catching up on that computer work tired boring stuff but somebody has to do it justwhy does it have to be me oy lrm 216 i am so sorry you are having the bone pains and numbness i have gone through 2 of my 12 taxol treatments and have been taking b6 b complex and claritin and aleve also using powder hoping to stop the neuropathy so far a few nights ago i had a little numbness and tingling starting in my hands but not since just wanted to give you a few things to possibly try if you would like to see if they help you out i know it must have really been tough to have to have your treatment delayed cannot wait to get back on a treadmill as i am now starting to gain weight since i am not nauseated on the taxol my problem is that my treadmill is at my fitness club have one at home oh yeah the dusty old nordic track that is manual i suppose i could get desparate enough to get that out for now i just see going to the gym witha scarf or my wig would be sweating like crazy again it must be so great to be done and looking forward to your exchange surgery unfortunately i have to have radiation and be a candidate for the exchange they told me my only choice was the tram flap i had such problems in the hospital with not being able to urinate after the mastectomy that i really cannot even begin to think about the tram flap surgery and what i would go through but i have another year to think about it and check it out since it is not recommended until 4 to 6 months after radiation anyhow i believe again great to be done and congrats i have gained about 6 pounds in the past year only 4 11 so on me those pounds show before tamox if i put on a few pounds just increase my excercise and decrease my eating and lose the weight but now despite the fact that i have increased the excercise and decreased the eating considerably the damned scale budge almost like my metabolisim has shut down had my thyroid checked and that is fine mo said that this is a side effect of tamox so great in addition to all the other stupid side effects i have to deal with i have to be fat while dealing with them grrrrrrrrrr just about 7 or 8 weeks out of hair is starting to fuzz my eyes seems to be back to normal and my fingernails seem the neuropathy seem to be improving my feet feel like chunks of meat attached to my legs i am taking a morning and night is there anything else i can do will it ever resolve log in to post a reply hi all since i have been posting on here i find myself feeling much better when reading some of your posts i started a trial about a month ago with femara and bkm 120 experimental drug hoping to knock down some of my mets i posted a month or more ago with the latest diagnosis of diffused liver mets not to mention my skin bones spleen peritoneal and omentum think i got them all at any rate i have my appt at dana farber tomorrow to see nurse and do blood work a couple of weeks ago my liver function tests came down which i am not sure how that happens when i have so much cancer there i have been having up and down days like most of you it is hard for me to believe that i have this much cancer and do not look sick at all on the outside but sure have a lot of cancer to fight i have been doing this for almost five years stage iv from the start i watch many of my friends die of this disease i have stayed positive through this whole time but tonight i guess i am just down a bit i have a scan on november 1st to see if femara and drug is working with the trial i am on my right and left sides ache from time to time maybe that is the liver and spleen i have not vomitted since i started the trial and am happy i can keep food down only se so far just started was diarrhea and is that a fun time over all other than the aches as usual i am okay i am just wondering how you all deal with so much cancer to fight and how you get through your days always wondering what the next scan will say this will be my last hormonal with the experimental drug i had to try i failed on all others and have failed on xeloda and taxol recently within the last two years taxol was last that is when we found liver stuff i guess i am just hoping trial is doing something but not so sure femara and this other drug can kick all this cancer back on a positive note i am having dinner with patrick dempsey on saturday night for the last three years i have raised money for the cancer center he started in maine i am good friends with his sister and mom they recently took me out for my birthday dinner i be the only one at dinner but i will be happy to see and talk to him again he is a wonderful person and keeps me grounded when hes home to visit so for all you mcdreamy fans i will be rubbing shoulders with him this weekend let me know your thoughts on how you cope expspecially knowing that the chemos will eventually not work or run out of options art neulasta is a sub cutaneous injection and can be given in the arm leg hips belly or back typically most nurses will do it in the arm i gave myself mine in the belly audra if you read the literature enough everything we do can cause cancer i am healthy weight eat healthy exercise daily drink once or twice per year if that breastfed 3 kids for a full year and here i am here we all are after this mess is done i am not going to stress about whether or not every little thing could cause cancer because i will drive myself crazy doing so i will try again to be generally healthy and see how things go i do not want the stress of trying to avoid cancer to give me a heart attack after 4 taxoteres one toenail is history hooray for it not being flipflop season the other 19 nails on the fingers and toes are holding their own so far knightzoo i hope your headache has subsided i am so sorry about your trip that just plain sucks i hope when this is all done that you can plan a special celebration trip somewhere somewhere warm and sunny with a beach hi bridget i was diagnosed with stage 1 mucinous carcinoma in 2004 had a bilateral mast with recon 4 rounds of a c chemo and a total all in 2005 i took tamoxifen from may 05 until nov 06 when i switched to arimidex i took it for a grand total of 7 months whereupon i became nearly crippled with joint pain and weakness i have since returned to taking tamoxifen and continue on it until 2010 i will not take arimidex again the plan for me was to take tamoxifen for 3 yrs and then take arimidex for 5 years giving me 8 years of post chemo treatment that will not be happening for me when done with the tamoxifen i am done i feel i was as aggressive as i could be at the time many people have said it was overkill but i wanted to do all that i could when it first happened my oncologist feels that with the bilat chemo hyst and now tamoxifen i have an 8 chance of recurrence who knows crap shoot in my opinion just my 2 cents as far as arimidex is concerned although by the way i know 3 women who have little to no side effects from it and a couple of cripples like me best wishes tina i was just to the eye doctor last week because my eyes never did stop tearing after i finished taxotere 17 months ago i thought the constant tearing might be because of a blocked tear duct or something turns out it is dry eye due to the and my oil glands are getting clogged so i am now doing the baby shampoo and the compresses too also using lubricating eye drops morning and night and rewetting drops with the contacts hopefully this will help because the constant tearing is very annoying and disruptive to my vision i had a diagnosis of lupus sle 25 years ago and an autoimmune thyroid disease about 10 years ago there is a connection between lupus and breast cancer in that estrogen drives the development of lupus as well as er breast cancer scroll down on the link below to see the relevant section hormones bind estrogen so when i became hypothyroid as a result of a hemithyroidectomy that probably left a lot of estrogen unbound in my system paving the way for cancer again i take femara similar to arimidex which causes joint pain from my lupus days i know that exercise helped me manage the pain and eventually get in remission from lupus i exercise like crazy these days in hopes that i will stay in remission from any autoimmnue disorders as well as manage my side effects for those with active lupus estrogen deprivation could improve symptoms there is also an autoimmune aspect to cancer in that cancer tricks our macrophages to helping it as opposed to killing it so hoping that exercise helps me stay in remission from cancer as well i had 12 tx of weekly taxol after four every other week ac my hair fell out on ac and then after about week seven began to grow back on taxol it grew back curly i still have a bit of a wave and maybe because taking biotin it grows an inch a month and is super thick better than before i had little c taking biotin might help you an inexpensive supplement found at natural food stores but your hair will grow back sandyloveslucy i am in the same boat as you are and self employed also and did the panic how am i going to do this with no work and no pay have you decided on chemo yet my onc and several research abstracts online had compelling arguments to go ahead with it so i am on tch way through and right each time i have a cumulative response to the big doses i get dosed every week tch every 3 weeks and herceptin alone the weeks in between i had a big dose on the 4th and spent the week in nausea barely controlled by meds i feel like the party i supposedly went to was really great because still hung over my mouth also tastes like i ate the contents out of all the ashtrays i would be interested to hear what you decide with chemo good luck in your decision hi jan i had 4 rounds of ac followed by 4 rounds of taxol with 7 days of neupogen after each round all i can say is ouch starting the evening of my first shot i felt like someone was squeezing me from within my oncologist told me that while my bones were producing white cells my bones would ache no kidding my jaw neck and shoulders would hurt terribly my ribs felt like i was being crushed and my chest would ache from breathing from the taxol i would get shooting pains down my legs and only my pain meds would take the edge off i now have neuropathy in my feet from the taxol and two weeks ago i was diagnosed with lymphedema to top it off my lymphedema specialist told me that since my left side was compromised from my mastectomy that i have given myself the neupogen shots in the left side of my stomach ummmmm a little late needless to say alive today and i plan to stay that way linda thanks everyone that reaction yesterday was a real shock and scary fine today but since they gave me extra steroids this time up early and full of energy i expect to be this way for a day or two so trying to get some extra work done sure be queasy this weekend itchy next week and tired the week that be too concerned everyone is different very sorry that my story added to your anxiety been having reactions to taxotere since my 2nd treatment and been getting increasingly worse my docs and i were expecting that get these skin rashes again probably at their worst after this last treatment but the reaction i had during the infusion was a surprise to everyone and i wish had an indication as soon as the taxotere started flowing that something was wrong but the reaction start until after the bag was empty valerie good luck today i know exactly how you feel chin up in the home stretch lottie hi did 2 of taxol yesterday still pretty good aches and pains little sleep think because of the steroids in but all in all nothing unbearable yet waiting for the hair loss thinning or whatever comes with the taxol know when that will start but be ready i hope on tch since dec 08 where the t is taxol had diarrhea for what seems like forever from the carbo been very dizzy sometimes when i stand up the room swimsand my hands have tremors so much so that my arms wave around twice i collapsed to the floor had a brain scan to see if i had mets there but clear my cats are getting better should have only 2 more infusions has anyone else had such extreme dizziness usually it is regular dizziness this extreme stuff is about once or twice a week other than this the poops and acid reflux thatare tormenting me oh yeah chemo brain has been making it a real joy as i go on job interviews elizabeth adding insult to injury what cancer is all about girls corkscrew hair big foreheads pointy ears liquid farts swollen guts black fingernails invisible eyebrows very messy homes very very tidy ginas and no sex wtf told all my friends do not do cancer it is shite i had my last blood test today by 12pm tomorrow aus time i will be off the for the last three days i have been preparing secret recipe barrier cream for the fan irritation we call the gina a fanny here in australia biotene toothpaste flat out for the mouth lining slippery elm bark for the digestive tract drinking yoghurt for the gut ground linseed for the colon and sachets of some fizzy shite for the expected cystitis no wonder i feel bloated with all that crap in my system oh well according to what i read here i can also look forward to some tickly and peeing in many directions chemo ses are just so much fun think oh and then i have to do the bf tamoxifen thing and lose 20 lbs feck xxxkerry i just thought i would post the results of my eye exam this morning since i am not only having problems with vision far away now that i have before but my close focus abilities have diminished also first off sweatyspice thanks for the information i printed it out and gave it to the optomologist today he was going to give it back to me and i told him keep it it is useful information because of what you posted he ran some additional test that normally he done in the past my vision problem he said is related to the tamoxifen what is happening is that my eyes are not dilating like they should the medication is causing my pupils to dialate so when i get into bright light my pupils should constrict and get smaller but they that is why i have a very difficult time in any type of bright light or flourescent type lighting so just wanted to get that information out there i never really look at my pupils to begin with but now i can just imagine being pulled over by the cops them looking at my eyes and thinking i am on some illegal narcotics hope you mind if i pop in i started chemo last tuesday i went thru abraxane chemo in feb mar then bilat surgery and now 4 cycles of carbo taxol avastin i have a 10 month old and feeling rough got mouth sores and yeast infection the bone pain from the taxol has gone but feeling like i know how going to do this hi sylvia first of all i must apologise for taking so long to reply i hope you are well and my thoughts are with all the people on this forum and i wish them all well with their treatment i have been sitting down after the kids are in bed then not being able to face whats going on thank you so much for replying to my post and all the information and support you have given me i have spoken with my sister about the information you have given me on the scans and she is going to raise it with my mums chemotheraphy doctor at their next meeting i unfortunatley dont live close to my mum so hopefully things will be clearer and we will get some answers regarding the scans my cancer is stage 2 after being wrongly told it was stage 3 currently undergoing chemo and has just had her second dose of fec she has 1 more of fec to go and then 3 doses of doxetaxel followed by radiotheraphy managing well with the chemo except her hair is falling out now which is very upsetting for us all i am not sure which node was positive for cancer only that it was just the one and she had an axuillary node clearence my heart goes out to mumtobe and i wish you all the best for you and your family xxx here is the link to the important threads for chemo newbies you will find the list of tips and other helpful threads dealing with the you are planning to ice your nails during the taxotere or taxol portion of your infusions let me know i will post some instructions ideas on how to do this the icing is to help prevent nail damage from that family of chemo drugs i know some of you started yet and the anxiety is high the reading of others chemo experiences and the list of possible side effects help but the reality is you are preparing and educating yourselves so you can handle whatever comes your way that is taking control and a very positive thing to do while in chemoland i am 10 months pfc with 6 rounds of cytoxan taxotere i was very fortunate and had minimal side effects i iced my toe nails and finger nails and hadslightnail coloration and somehorizontal nail indentions each indention seemed appear after with every round of chemo i kept a food diary and drug diary so i forget to take my meds and also to keep track of what foods i ateseemed to work the best i also ate small mealsso that i always had a little something in my tummy it is also better to take your with food since those drugs on their own can cause nausea ifyouexperience side effectssuch as nausea constipation or diarrhea and those effects seem to linger wait to call your onco infusion nurse and think you can ride it out you just need to call to get some help so that the onco can adjust your meds and help you get through this chemoland time the truth is no one really knows what side effects you will experience since body reacts different to chemo that you are botheringyour onco because it is thejob of the onco to help you matter what time of day or what day of the week it is there is always an onco on call to handle these times wishing each of the bestand just know there arethose whohave travelled before you here so you alone andyour group here is gathering to help carryand support each of you through i want to intrude on your group but if you have questions happy to help joni taxol mainly just made me tired but not sick hair loss a give w it either just googled the other drug and the good news gemcitabine represents an advance in pancreatic cancer care it is also not as debilitating as other forms of chemotherapy i was more scared of the cancer returning versus taking tamoxifen i took tamoxifen for 2 years and then switched to arimidex ai with monthly faslodex shots i was premenopausal and i was put into chemo pause and in order to take an ai i have to be in memopause so the faslodex insures my body stays in menopause i had gained almost 30 lbs from chemo and yes the fact that tamoxifen could cause weight gain ticked me off because before this all started i was lean and a size 4 i switched from tamoxifen to arimidex because of the depression i had on the tamoxifen i became a raving biatch at times i thought my husband would leave me zoloft and tamoxifen do not mix now i am on arimidex and zoloft and doing very well i switched over to keep my marriage going like some others have said take it and if you deal with it ask your onco if you can switch it up to something else everyone has different side effects with all of the treatments some people have major side effects and others have pretty much none tocomplain about you know until you try it btw i have lost 25 lbs in less than 4 months by maintaining a very strick calorie per day intake and lots of exercise exercise alone do it for me even though i tried for 2 years to lose the weight that way so i cut out all sugar in my diet and started reading labels not everyone gains weight on tamoxifen it is just a se that is listed like many others joann i never get any side effects of herceptin the week after tch i am weakened and it seems to bother more but outside of that i have no problems with the h by itself blue sorry to hear but glad you are learning it does help to know what to expect it did me anyway next time you can look at your calendar if you have kept record of your days and know when you will come out of it your almost out now day 10 you will be the lowest of your immune count so be careful not to get around anyone sick then day 11 your body will start to repair itself again and you will begin to feel normal nothing you can do but ride it out you can try to eat more of a normal diet for me and carolyn we found that a light diet worked best for us but everyone is different as far as the next time it will be easier cause they will know how to adjust your dose also they may change the nausea meds i first began with zofran that works for most people to emend that worked better for me i hated that feeling of slight nausea now i have none at all just the tiredness as they tweek your dose and new meds you will feel better be sure to tell them all your s e so they can do that for you one thing i can say that the tiredness will not go away your body is taking a big hit and that is a common s e for all of us i just ride it out til its done and keep saying to myself that i am tired but those cancer cells are worse cause they are getting zapped if we gain weight as a side effect of one of the drugs we are on i think there is a durn thing we can do about it i gained on the hormonal treatments and tried and tried to lose weight but every month at i would be up two lbs and since i did those for many years it added up i weighed about 125 when wasdiagnosed stage lv and went alll the way up to 160something which was an alltime high for me eventually i did lose the weight but i am gaining again now on abraxane and i think it is because of the steroids and the fact my sense of taste is all messed up and i am always eating things trying to find something that tastes good or that i can taste at all now that it is in my liver i am more worried about now about the chemo working and the other side effects than the lbs but i remember how i used to obsess over the weight i would take off my shoes and anything heavy still do actually before getting weighed and it was mostly with tamoxifen and i recall when the tamoxifen stopped working and he changed me to something else adn then i went to the pharmacy with the new rx and was almost unable to choke out the words the tamoxifen working any more when i gave it to the phamacist cuz i was crying so hard but of course i did the same thing with the next drug griped about the weight gain just part of being a woman we are brainwashed into thinking being slim is good instead of appreciating our health the good news is that after treatment the weight will come off how are you doing with the abraxane i know menopause has a lot to do with weight gain once the body adjusts to menopause i think you stop gaining my entire shape changed never had a stomach but sure did get one whereas before it always went right to my hips amazing how much effect estrogen has on our body this whole thing is a big adventure not a fun one sounds like there is a lot going on with everyone had my 3 taxol today done i wait for chemo to be done i guess i thought all be easier somehow although i complain much about taxol 2 still pain and numbness but not nearly as bad as my experience with taxol 1 had my first herceptin treatment today too i have stopped wearing my wig and just goe along with the scarf hat look just more comfortable and sorry about the constipation i have had a really rough time with that too i tried taking ducolase 2 times per day and that helped a little but seem to upset my stomach so even though i was told not to eat salad and raw vegetable unless they are peeled i went ahead and took the chance i wash them all really well on only prepare them at home i don t eat salads etc for a restaurant i also found some prunes which i have always hated that are infused with and orange flavor they also have lemon those actually taste okay and i have been eating one servinga day regularly in addition i purchased some cottonelle wipes and use them soley on my behind i used regular toilet paper in weeks plus i follow up with a tucks pad after each bowel movement this all had really helped me manage my constipation and help with the painful side effects too i have also used sitz baths when needed but since my following my new routine had to use those much i know 8 chemos much compared to other cancer victims i have run into during my sessions but 8 is enough and they end soon enough hope treatments this week have gone or are going better than your last ones hang in there everyone i wait for hair anyone have any idea on how long it take to grow back in my little brother 15 years my junior is getting married in november did taxotere i get any growth until the three month mark i was sure i was one of those who would never get it back i will be honest with you not what it was i have a theory that tax is extremely hard on fine hair like eyelashes and the temple i have receding and hardly any lashes or brows i am grateful for full coverage but it is thinner i would say that 6 might not get it back but probably a lot more have their hair change i am very happy with himalaya herbal hair loss oil biotin and fish oil i also adore tarte waterproof brow liner might do some permanent makeup there is a master here in chicago who works with cancer survivors good morning ladies bright and sunny here this morning but still cold i think more than ready for warm weather robin hope you slept well last night cy glad to hear been having nice weather at least i just saw some beautiful hydrangeas for sale at the grocery store of all places purple white and blue i think they are my favorite flower after daisies tracey i get it either why you take a job that sounds like a promotion with a pay raise would you be the manager of your former i know that can be tough sometimes but is doable if everyone acts professionally and there any who feel like they deserved the position etc i agree you need to ask a lot of questions about what would be different and absolutely go for it if you think a good idea hey ginney glad to hear that you are feeling positive and strong i understand what you mean about having mixed emotions about spending time here so supportive and empowering yet can sometimes feel like it keeps cancer in the forefront of your mind i can only imagine that the second dx is just more of everything more scared more strong more everything i always love your posts your contributions to this board are always positive thoughtful and kind i want to speak for anyone else but my guess is the general reaction will be read when you can post when you feel good about it be well and know that we love you too iris glad to see you back and glad that the alarm system is working i think they pretty much expect to come out for a least one false alarm whenever they install one of those you made me laugh about the cell phone i got mine 3 years ago now i think and i am holding onto it i told the guy i just wanted a phone that was a phone i need it to take pictures send be a calendar or access the internet i just needed to be able to reached if my son was throwing up a school and needed to be picked up he thought i was crazy but i love my simple little phone nicki ooohhhh i love really good licorice totally get the freaking out since the ee thing sorry that having a tough time hope your onc is nice about it one of the things i really hate about bc is that we are responsible for dx a recurrence or mets up to us to determine if an ache or pain is just an ache or pain or if it needs to be brought to the attention of the onc about one year out of treatment i started having serious pain along my spine and both sides of my rib cage cancer and after it had been going on for 3 weeks i called my onc and was shocked to find myself having a bone scan the very next day well of course it came back negative and i swear she kind of gave me the every little ache and pain cancer look lecture so of course now i hesitate to say anything hurts because i want to be accused of crying wolf frustrating anyway if it comforts you at all had hip and femur the thigh bone right pain off and on for a year now i think we had the same chemo dd ac t and i had a really bad reaction to the taxol and sometimes think it just permanently messed up my bones it certainly permanently messed up my nails stay strong and try to enjoy the weekend and speak up for yourself on monday you know all be right there with you vicki i might just copy you and light myself a fire too alone this weekend warren is at his and i have any plans today except cleaning bills and those darn taxes a fire a cup of tea and a good book sounds really good to me right now cheri ok i need something to do with my free time since not doing the things supposed to be doing like exercising cleaning etc so i think i will check out this knifty knitter situation this weekend now i am able to knit a square or rectangle using regular knitting needles i just make mistakes along the way have to check out the thread about the afghan and see if i can get involved assuming that even the squares that are made with more love than skill are welcomed lol sheri first of all glad to hear feeling even a little bit better every little bit counts i know nothing about backs or spines but i do know that when i hurt my muscles in my back on my right side my left side hurt worse after a time it was something about the bad muscles pushing the good muscles out of shape as well and me holding myself in a weird way to protect the bad muscles that actually strained the good muscles does that make sense at all not sure it would relate to discs or bones though you can see how it kind of make sense with muscles i guess i am so sick of ins co not paying for stuff i hope you are able to work it out on mail order so not too expensive now i have a question for you girls it has been pointed out to me that when someone tells me soomething i respond with a similar story of my own and that this is annoying i my post and i definitely do this in my head i think trying to say to the person not alone i can relate to what saying etc really trying to take this criticism in the spirit in which it was intended cause i would never want anyone to feel that i listening empathetic or that i was trying to them what do you girls think do you think it makes me come across as only thinking about myself no matter what going to be conscious of it now but truly interested in your honest feedback one of the things i try to make sure i do is to really live in each moment or whatever that expression is not to be sitting there thinking about everything i have to do if my son is taking 10 minutes to tell me about a scene from a movie that already seen a hundred times lol the suggestion was that instead of talking about a similar experience i just say that a similar thing happened to me once so i can really understand how you feel i know even as i write this out realizing all a matter of degree i guess anyway thanks for listening enjoy the weekend colleen was hoping someone might be able to share their experience or make me feel a little less on my own since my oncs areon vacation and the thought of going another week or two with this uncertainty feels like it may push me over the brink i just need to be able to share with people who who appreciate how difficult the waiting is afew weeks ago i was in for my herceptin infusion been having a lot of trouble breathing for about 6 weeks or so but by that point it was worse still is not like when i have bronchitis or pneumonia but like there was is a weight on my chest and i feel like i can never get enough air or take a deep breath after examining meand sayingmy labs very good they me the herceptinand sent me down to the er instead they saidi needed blood and that might help but that it seemed like there was something else going ape since i just had surgery last month and on tamoxifen they did a chest ct in the er and quickly ruled out a pe but said that the scanshowed some things and they wanted to admit me i was taken off guard declined in retrospect i probably should have stayed but sure you all understand not wanting to plus mylittle boys were upset that i home want me to have another hospital sleepover they said that it appeared that i may have a partially collapsed left lung and that i either had pneumonia in that lung or there was some other process going on in there or maybe both they also said there was a small nodule in the lung forthe rest of the details the dr said have to follow up with my oncologist sothey kept me there onoxygen monitors for another 5 or 6 hours of observation sent mehome with anantibiotic in casepneumonia was contributing to my issues and told me to follow up with my onc asap myprimary oncologist at the hospital was still is away so i see her that left my cancer center i even sure i wanted to tell him i had been in the er so i waited a week to see if things improved with the antibiotics they decided topick the ct disc and report up to share with him of course i read the ct report in the car and saw that in addition to what they said in the er there was also a cm mass that could be of lymph node origin in the anteriormediastinum when i was in with my onc he said that since the er report said unchanged after it described the mass and lung nodule that they wereprobably ok one word made it all ok when i got home i googled it and thought maybe he have been his usual dismissive self especially since i had chest wall invasion and a 10cm area of involvement with multiple tumors at that seem to make the anterior mediastinum not that uncommon a site for mets but i figured that since it was unchanged maybe it wasok but i just feel right about it so i thought get my reportsto set my mind at ease i got a copy of the er report which says that my last chest ct was in so this should be what the unchanged relates to but when i got the report from a few weeks after diagnosis it says my lungs are clear and there is no mention of the mediastinum i also had a chest ct in aug 2010 different hospital to see if chemo made me operable and a planning ct for radiation this january so i decided to get those too say anything and the 2010 report clearly states that my lungs and mediastinum were clear and free of lymphadenopathy so maybe the unchanged on the er report was a mistake or maybe it really was there on the ct and they failed to mention it in the it disappeared with chemo last year is back now i called my nurse to relay what the reports saidon monday when i got the lastone but she said on vacation for the holidays now and my hospital onc is still gone until the middle of jan i generally speak up with my doctors so being persistent with something like this is fairly uncharacteristic for me but part of the reason why here should i let this go and not worry about it i want to seem like a hypochondriac but i am concerned especially because still having trouble breathing and get winded from just walking around the house has anyone had any experience with an anterior mediastinal mass that turned out to be something orthe samefor a lung nodule thanks sorry for the loooong post it the quick one i intended all your rants help to put mine in perspective some families are in denial as they are so busy with their own lives that we need to tell them regularly how we well janice jteach if you read this i would like to know more about your neuropathy improvement i finished taxol in september 2010 and still have balance problems and neuopathy in my fingers and toes your post on the neuorpathy site did give me hope though hope everyone is having a better day have only just found this thread and have read all the posts with interest as when i went to rm 18th dec the lovely registrar informed me scan results were not good seems letrozole stopped working bone mets progressed and now sign of mets in the liver i have been given exemestane and they have applied for funding for should get an answer in 2 weeks time interested in your side effects cough and tiredness as i already have those sruggled to get through christmas day but gave in yesterday and spent most of it sleeping i have not told my family about the recent dx yet i really see the point until after the next scan when hopefully it will become clearer as to progression i have a bone scan 7th january as i have been having a lot more bone pain i had expected an mri but onc said they needed a baseline for comparison when starting the new treatment just wondered if any of you have bone mets and if so have you noticed any improvement i am also on zometa but recently the pain has got know i have partial vertebrae collapse i am not really worried about the i never really had any with letrozole which pleased onc as she thought this might prove the case with new treatment so fingers crossed really pleased to see this treatment seems to be working for you and am really hoping pct will fund worried about options if they as chemo has never worked for me happy new year to all xx hi i am almost done 2 boosts to go the nurse practioner said she was amazed at how well my skin did since so light with plenty of freckles i got pink and itchy about week 3 red and itchy about week 4 i started out with cream then a few weeks into it got some alra and emu oil i alternated those 3 until i got a sample of my girls cream i kept the alra in the car and put it on as soon as i got out of rads the emu oil i put on at night no one at dana farber ever said to air it out but i did because of all the advice i got here i also swam during the whole rads time some oncs tell you not to swim because the chlorine can bother your skin but my rads onc knew it was important to me and said go ahead and see how your skin does he recommended the hydrocortisone cream for itching but it really help i put it on a few times before bed i bought some benadryl but never used it fatigue was never an issue with me i exercised a lot i like the my girls cream the best nice smell and very light diane i felt the same way you did i had a hard time believing i had bc i feel like i sailed through the surgery chemo and radsand know if it was because i was so about preventing side effects or just dumb luck but almost everyone says never seen anyone go through breast cancer treatment like i did that probably means be the one with the recurrence i believe i will look back once done afraid of hormone therapy and will not take arimidex due to the side effect of high cholesterol i already have diabetes high cholesterol and high blood pressure as well as fibromyalgia and hypothyroidism the oncs are interested in survival but i am interested in overall survival perhaps my risk of having a heart attack would be higher on arimidex than my risk of returning breast cancer without it so i need to talk to my primary care dr as well i am leaning toward tamoxifen and am also starting several natural remedies if i can help anyone please feel free to pm me peeps dear mary before starting to use the port and between medicines they push small bagfuls of saline water through the port to clean flush and to minimize the effect of different drugs interacting with each other in a small space i know if the are standard across chemo centers but i think so my chemo center uses emend aloxi and decadron i have to take anything the day before but i know some women do they may give you a prescription for lidocaine prilocaine to apply on the port 30 minutes before and cover with glad wrap plastic sheet it will numb the skin over the port for the needle push so forget to do that if not they will probably spray it before pushing the needle the first time they infuse any drug into you they do it slowly to watch for reactions or other effects second dose of the same drug is faster and the future doses are all at the one fastestrate i only had problems with cytoxan sinus pressure even when they slowed it down to 60 minutes other than red color in pee and bloating right away i had no side effects on day 1 next morning is when it all started i was ok to drive back on my own but dh is driving me around if you are going back for a single shot then thats neulasta if you are getting daily shots then that is neupogen i am losing my hair rapidly starting today day 17 thank you for your post and for your detailed account about everything that is happening to you this will be of great help to anyone viewing this thread and going through chemotherapy i was sorry to know that you are experiencing pain i did not know that knee pain and muscle fatigue are classic side effects of taxotere i must have been very lucky as i did not experience any of this when i was on taxotere on its own and had four rounds of it every three weeks all i remember is losing my eyebrows and eyelashes and having a funny taste in my mouth do you think you are having more side effects because you are taking the taxotere together with cytoxan cyclophosphamide i had epirubicin ellence and cyclophosphamide together for four cycles every three weeks for the first three months of my treatment i must have been lucky with that too because i just suffered hair loss and fatigue i did not need any painkillers for the whole of my treatment and took only the medication given for a couple of days after treatment do you think that you might be overdoing things you are working full time and doing a lot of walking perhaps you might want to cut down and go for gentle short walks i can understand that you are not happy about putting on weight but as maria said you will probably lose it after treatment i am interested in this weight problem that seems to affect some women during treatment is there something in the steroids that makes people put on weight or is it the fact that steroids increase your appetite and so you overeat if there is some ingredient in the steroids why would you not have put on weight before since you have been taking prednisone before you developed breast cancer keep your positive attitude you have come this far and you can get through this and before you know you will be back to a more normal life and it will be behind you make sure that you get proper iv insertion you do not want to end up with damaged hands i remember how bruised i was a couple of times thinking of you and wishing you well sylvia xxx i started tamoxifen on day 3 of my cycle my periods have gone from being set your watch by it regular to anywhere from 3 to 6 weeks in between they have also gotten shorter and lighter that may well be as much a function of my age 51 as of tamoxifen also developed a fun new discharge that shows up occasionally in the year and a quarter since my diagnosis lost about 55 pounds about 35 of them since i started the tamoxifen i have increased my activity level and decreased the amount of food i eat i think that the tamoxifen caused the weight loss but i also think it has made it any harder the hot flashes were there last summer and seemed to be triggered more frequently when i was hot or exercising they tapered off during the cooler weather but they are getting more frequent again so i think that for me at least staying cool helps keep them less frequent and less severe most of us are in an age group where other health issues could be brewing so it is important to ask ourselves if a particular issue that we are dealing with is in fact a side effect of the tamoxifen or if it could be due to another cause this is particularly important because some of those other issues can be detrimental to our health if left unaddressed and or may be easily treated eliminating the issue that is causing us problems just completed my 12th taxol infusion yesterday i will begin my 4 ac dose dense treatments on march 2nd i was informed that i will need to take decadron twice a day for 3 days after my chemo treatment to prevent nausea so of course i googled the side effects of decadron and i am not planning on taking the drug i am meeting with my oncologist tomorrow and will ask if there is anything else i can take i had 2 nausea prescriptions filled and they remain at the bottom of purse untouched throughout my 12 taxol treatments the side effects of decadron that scared me swelling in the face moonface increased appetite e g eating every in the refrigerator including the refrigerator wild emotions which i already have imagine being any wilder i came this far into my treatment without having a puffy face and without gaining any weight i refuse to look any different this close to the end of my treatments maybe it is just vanity but so be it basically my question is this has anyone gone through 4 ac treatments without having nausea or what drug s did you take to prevent nausea the only thing i am noticing different about myself is that i now have heartburn but absolutely no nausea i drink water during my infusion after my infusion more water the following day until it is coming out of my ears i seem to think that this has helped me immensely thanks for any advice you can give me paula believe it or not i just had an appt with my onc yesterday to ask those same questions i am not going to have to go through radiation so i only have 4 weeks of treatment left i know every oncologist is different but my onc said that 2 weeks after chemo is over i will have a pet scan then he will see me one week after that do blood work and go over my scans he said for the first two years he will see me every 3 months to do blood work a tumor marker and the ovarian cancer marker as i am brca 2 i was having a lot of anxiety issues which i am not prone to at the thought of ending treatment and what would happen then talking to the onc yesterday helped to alleviate a lot of those fears also the onc said that as soon as chemo ends he is going to do a blood test to determine whether i am pre or if chemo has kicked me into permanent menopause he will put me on femara if i am i will go on tamoxifen i am 45 and have not had a period since i started chemo but was pretty regular before then susan i found out today my oncoytpe is 26 andi will need chemotherapy i opted for adriamycin cytoaxn x3 for 4 cycles i could have done a clinical trial but one of the drugs was taxol and i already have daily joint muscle pain so i opted for the more traditional therapy i would be interested in hearing how others did on adriamycin cytoxan regiment i have all my anti nausea drugs and i have a muga scan scheduled for monday my first infusion is this tuesday log in to post a reply no great answers sorry i started tamox years ago and the hot flashes came with a vengeance but not certain it was the tamox could have been natural as i also went through menopause during my 3 year course of treatment for me the very worst side effect was debillitating fatigue but the hot flashes were a close second very little sleep like you i had fans placed when i gave up on everything else i slept in the nude no sheets overhead fan air conditioning plus a tall fan blowing straight at me about 6 inches from the bed nothing helped i will say i got a respite when i switched to an ai i was so excited and thought stopped flashing let me tell you even worse when they come back after mentally prepared yourself my onc put me on what is it and to see if it would help i thought it did then i stopped it and when they came back but i went back on the and still frequent intense crazy so i know some doctors try that or she was just trying to get me on an who knows i know any sort of exertion any walking along and carrying a jacket for goodness sakes can bring on a big flash had to expose my fat bare arms to strangers because i was worried pass out so sorry i know any answers i had ice water everywhere too hey that reminds me that i do the fan at my bedor the ice water on my nightstandnow so the ai flashes are at least still better than the tamox flashes i guess be glad you can take them my friend took nothing and she just lost her battle so hang in there tough but worth it one more thing funny you post about freezing i see many people say this when i was younger i was never cold but for about years before diagnosis i simply could never get warm it was crazy now like you i sit at my desk all day turning my heat on and my fan off then my heat off and my fan on crazy to be sure have you talked to your doctor about tamoxifen while it has its own se joint pain is lessof an issue hot flashes can be controlled with effexor okay i know about flairs now i am going to have to go figure out the catbook bumperstickers and greenbucks linda i agree you can spend a lot of time on facebook i know that when i set up my myspace page i spent a lot of time there too a lot of my family is on myspace and that is how we keep in touch but here is where i feel more comfortable talking about the cancer crap glad that you are home and getting some rest meals for 2 i know that the women that gone to church with can really cook some good food go today for to see if the taxotere messes with my counts like the fec did also going to talk to her about the bone mixture of ibuprofen benadryl just cutting it had bursitis in my hips for years and the taxotere has exacerbated it mouth is sore making it difficult to eat no actual sores but tongue feels like it is on fire sleep well because of the hot flashes oldest grandson noticed that i have some hair asked him what color it was going to be and he said blonde that would be cool because never had blonde hair all of my siblings had blonde hair until they were years me hope that everyone has a great day hi ladies i started my chemo in september and just wanted to add some words of encouragement i get adriamycin cytoxan every 3 weeks for 4 treatments and then taxol herception for 12 weekly treatments last week was ac 3 i have been taking emend for nausea so far i have had no nausea my worse days are either 3 or 4 when the dexamethasone wears off on that day i feel llke coming down with the flu chills tired no appetite but then the next morning i wake up and feel 80 better i am very careful to drink 8 glasses of water jiuce every day and i irnse my mouth with either biotene or baking soda water so far no mouth sores the cytoxan provides me with a few days of miserable metal mouth but it seems to lessen during the following weeks my hair started falling out around day 18 after my first treatment so i had it buzzed to inch after the 3rd treatment my onc gave e a neulasta shot since my wbc kept going down so fa on day 3 and no bone pain taking claritin since i heard that it seems to help ward off or reduce any bone pain i was terrified of getting chemo and this website is a great support for helping ou get through the se i just wanted to say that not everyone gets every se hugs to all scrabblelady giving up on my hair growing properly anytime soon it actually started growing about 12 weeks ago in about week 3 of my weekly taxol herceptin but not all of my follicles have regrown hair so it is very thin but over 1 inch long i am almost 5 weeks out from last chemo and no sign of anymore hairs growing so i have the wig lady coming over on saturday wigs on wheels and i have told her i want to reorder the same one again and also now get another shorter one i got my centre to write me a referral letter which means i will be able to claim back against my health insurance as to eyelashes they fell out at the beginning of taxol and no sign of any growing back eyebrows they fell out at the beginning of taxol all except for about 4 on each side and no sign of any growing back jenn iamnancy i was having all kind of se with the flashes sweats joint and bone pain extreme exhaustion mental fog depression after about 9 months of this finally my mo allowed me to take a 3 week break while i sought an orthopedic for the joint pain and was given several other test although i was found to have osteoarthritis of the knees and osteopenia i was a changed woman at the end of the three week break depression lifted my libido came back i felt like someone coming out of a deep sleep i wanted to go out and have fun however the mo said i had to go back on an al i had the opportunity to try another med or go back on the anastrozole i chose to stick to something i but did start taking it at night i am still tired but not as much my night sweats and flashes are less and my lack of my pcp says is i am living with it i guess i was just surprise at what effects the al have on our bodies i am counting down the more to go hope you find one that works for you or that you can live with camille glad the mri went okay welcome to our club barb jazzy up too late again lol my quiet time after the kids go to bed silly i know plus the beautiful ses from tamoxifen hopefully the ai as insomnia inducing skittle be back next month oh well hope pt conferences go okay i know how you guys deal with those long days fl glad work is going okay your lunch sounds wonderful hi blondie curve teka hope all are well been a quiet board here recently i just completed th 9 on thursday it knocked me out i basically was down and on the sofa or in bed for three days my dear son decided saturday that i must need more vitamin d so he put his hammock up under some trees in yard and i spent hours in it just lounging and reading i felt so blessed to have him here i am almost back to normal but today is tuesday and chemo is thursday not much time to recover i am definitely feeling the cumulative effects of taxol these days last week i went for a followup echo and then saw the cardiologist yesterday great news my ejection fraction changed any since i started the herceptin i will still be every three months while on it but it looks like the 9 drop we saw was probably due to the adriamycin the cardiologist assured me that i be dropping dead anytime soon although that may sound funny i was really stressing out because i had a good friend die about a year ago of a massive heart attack curious how many here have regular echos or have had changes in their heart function since they started chemo ladies thanks for all of your feedback so sorry for those of youhaving se i was on tamoxifen for 2 yrs and just switched to aromasin a week ago i feel as if i just came out of a fog i just thought i was having normal depression but obviously it was the tamoxifen i was hungry all of the time and gained about 10 lbs i was depressed listless felt like i had add unmotivated tired hadjoint pain lose weight care about anything i know how long it takes but so far no major symptoms on aromasin i actually feel great all of the information seeing is saying about 15 of women will have thinning hair afraid of that and wondering just how much hair loss is involved grannydukes i know i would like my old life back too evening all jane i fell out of my chair got up off the floor and then fell down again lmaothinking about you and the water bottle phone love ya genia ihope all goes well for you i hope themd really listens to you and helps you if the tamox and prescribes best for you quality of life is a big big issue for me i had so much less discomfort and fatigue after my ac infusions that i thought it would be like that for a while more energy and less pain then came taxol and radiation not i feel well you guys know how it goes fatigue and increased joint pain lingers but hoping not for long my rheumy increased my neurontin gabapentin to 300 mgm per day and alreadyhitting those train steps with less pain fingers crossed i improve he says i did trigger a fms flare by doing those 38 days with 5 days off for burns that makes sense to me and if the case i have recovered from flares before and will again plus my first rheumy told me my fibromyalgia would flare again but never as much as the first time now tofigure out how to get to acupuncture chris i always pictured you with an accent too a good good thing we have this site and your addy to keep up with you juli follow advice takeyour med please love ya love the way you describe it spring i know you feel about treatments vein sticks and other medical procedures before i was dxed with these other pain in the neck diseases i was a pain wimp getting an iv in surgery or a blood drawmade me turn my head to the wall and grimace before the techs did the draw now i point out my one good arm vein wrist and hand veinsand i take multiple vein sticks who knew lol lollove everyone to pieces mina good morning ladies am here edi hope u mind me calling you that as i said before i feel like i know some of you already right i hope i do think joining here maybe one of the best things done in a while very much isolated as i suffer from social phobia due in most part to a past abusive relationship it got to a point where when i was originally diagnosed in 2010 i was unable to complete my radiation therapy as the stress of travelling 5 days a week for treatment became intolerable tamoxifen made my condition worse as it upped my anxiety levels so i came off of that too now here 4 years later with a recurrence and of course i blame myself though all of my doctors have assured me that no one can tell why the recurrence happened and to go easier on myself thankfully my anxiety meds have been tweaked over the years to the point where now much better able to cope with all the hoo hah happening now morwenna hope i got that right go back to check i lived in bognor regis for some years before moving along the coast to where i am now so yes i know worthing well all of sussex is beautiful i think originally from a town just north of london and i have to say i miss it one little bit anyway i hope in good spirits today my day is just beginning and hopefully at some point get to post my diagnosis gubbings and sort out an avatar we shall see hugsw xx a smallish person too at 5 and 120 lbs my weight shot up to 125 the day after chemo and i felt like the goodwill blimp but it was just temporary by the end of the week my weight was down to 116 a nice weight for me be afraid to drink the water the water will flush you out and will help the water retention really so sorry to hear you are feeling pukey i had that experience but not doing adriamycin which is the really tough stuff getting this even with the zofran have you tried taking pepcid although i have nausea i did have some acid reflux and found the pepcid really helped the tummy are you getting enough water down not easy when you feel shitty and are you constipated headache is associated with both dehydration and constipation hope this is of some help poor thing hi everyone i am ashley and a first time poster and wanted to jump into the april may chemo mixers i started my ac treatment april 3 and have had 4 rounds of that fun and am starting taxol next tuesday anyone else in this thread on taxol now or about to be the ac sure was a trip my side effects included nausea from days 3 8 after each treatment thrush in my mouth mood swings up the wazooo from all the drugs and some really uncomfortable constipation of course it wouldnt be complete without that i am hoping taxol will be easier but i hear it wipes us out a bit more anyways just wanted to join in to the message board community and figured this might be a good place to start peace x i was on cmf cytoxin methotrexate flouracil my first go round with cancer in 1993 it was quite tolerable if it is still given the same way the m and f are given in an iv push and the c are pills i had hair thinning but not loss i remember feeling the creepy crawlies but as i said it was tolerable good luck with your treatment hope its a breeze for you meima runner 4lifethanks the last few days have been better my husband had an interesting thought he thinks some of my anger is part of the healing process after the surgery and reconstruction i was so focused on healing and getting better i never grieved about the bc now that i am feeling well from the surgeries i have time to let my mind think about all that has happened somehow that helped me to feel more settled and normal the tamoxifen definitely takes all of my emotions to the extremes and the joint pain varies from day to day i laughed when you wrote you hated everything and everyone because that is how i have felt i have read on this site some women who stopped the tamoxifen started it during a different part of their cycles and did much better if you do decide to go back on it maybe this would give you some hope for a better tolerance to it i am so glad you are feeling better who should take aromatase inhibitors only postmenopausal women should take aromatase inhibitors aromatase inhibitor therapy may follow therapy with tamoxifen or it may be used as adjuvant therapy after primary cancer treatment in women who take tamoxifen the american society of clinical oncology asco recommends that adjuvant therapy for hormone receptor positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women include an aromatase inhibitor at some point either initially or after a course of tamoxifen to lower the risk of recurrence how long should you take aromatase inhibitors no clear guideline as exists for tamoxifen on how long to take an aromatase inhibitor current adjuvant therapy options include taking an aromatase inhibitor for five years after primary cancer treatment taking tamoxifen for two to three years and then switching to an aromatase inhibitor for the next two to three years or taking an aromatase inhibitor for five years after taking tamoxifen for five years what are the side effects and health risks of aromatase inhibitors side effects of aromatase inhibitors are generally mild in most women they include hot flashes joint pain muscle aches headache and fatigue the side effects especially joint pain can be quite prominent at times in some women because they lower your estrogen levels aromatase inhibitors could put you at greater risk of osteoporosis which increases your chances of bone fractures if you choose an aromatase inhibitor as adjuvant therapy your doctor may monitor your bone mineral density while taking the medication lower estrogen levels also may lead to vaginal dryness and irritation decreased estrogen levels also have an effect on your blood lipid levels some doctors are concerned that aromatase inhibitors might increase the risk of heart problems or cardiovascular disease some evidence that the different aromatase inhibitors may have different effects on lipid levels however research is ongoing and studies to date have provided conflicting results aromatase inhibitors encompass a rapidly changing area of research so ask your doctor about the latest information i will have 5 years in april 1 yr tamoxifen 4 yrs aromasin calling that the end oh i am so glad to find this thread seattle yay i was diagnosed with ibc on 09 i am divorced 34 i have a 17 year old son i am a nurse on medical leave during chemo my next chemo is tomorrow tues i do not tolerate chemo well on ac now but i was on tch for the first 2 doses then had a terrible rxn to the t so got switched to ac this will be my second ac i get so nauseated with ac i take emend aloxi zofran for nausea looks like a get together on the 17th be in bed with my zofran but i would love to meet others who are going through what going through been feeling so alone in this much love jessica fran i did monthly taxol and my hair fell out quite quickly but it may be different with the weekly dose the weekly taxol forum maybe very helpful to you had neuropathy from the taxol too i did not get neuropathic pain but tingling numbness and weakness in the hands and feet i still have that side effect but am now on abraxane which is similar to taxol wishing the best for you and your treatment plan jean i am diagnosed with ptsd and a panic disorder from childhood abuse i was very stable on meds for about a decade until after i had my first chemo i had a terrible reaction to the taxotere but i donot think that is all that was involved after chemo i was put on prednisone which sends me into orbit and into panic attacks but even off of the steroid i found i was having unusual panic for me at my stage of recovery in mental health i have been sober over 21 years not a brag and after the first chemo i felt as though i was brain damaged i only know the feeling because i had a lot of panic like thru the roof in early sobriety my brain simply couldnot function nor could it after the chemo i had very little impulse control and too much fatigue to deal with anything i found all of my emotions to be extremely raw and the anxiety was awful for me the chemo and its effects triggered old feelings and emotions and i could notmuster the emotional physical or spiritual resources to contend with the post chemo brain trauma i had to switch meds from klonopin to lorazepam therapy was of no use to me if i could not function well enough to get to my therapist i had to wait until i was a little more stable on the new medications tobegin to work on the ptsd again ptsd for meflairs up under stress and cancer is the most stressful event i can think of i thought i would be able tojumpright backintomy daily activities after the chemo becasue that is what the doctor toldme would happen boy was he ever wrong and six weeks after the first chemo he continues to be wrong i have to keep my day very simple i have to set time aside for rest i have tohave proper nutrition caffiene and sugar isa for me and i am having to use all of the tools i used in early sobriety to try and stabilize myself at a bio psycho social level in short no intense events going on for me in a perfect world and i truly have to vent a lot either here on the board or with trusted friends who have been thru cancer and are further down the road than i am lastly i had to learn how to breathe again and push myself to do daily exercise like a walk to the mail box on some i can do i also curb my activities and try not to set myself up for failure i do not know how women go back to work right after chemo grocery shopping may be alli can do one day with laundry the next my house still looks like a dumpster with windows on it today is the first day i manage to clean the house a bit but i am paying for it in very sore muscles tonight the one thing i am not doing well is getting enough i am posting on the board at 2 am or something like good luck my dear sv hello good to hear from all of you nails i had 4 x ac and 12 taxol and kept my nails moisturized and at the end of taxol they were so long but actually dead so broke off to nubs but never fell off completely i did loss two pinky toe nails i got what they call hand foot syndrome with ac and my feet peeled and we sore to walk on but after we baby smooth so guess that was a bonus after ahh the red devil i actually started to get neuropathy on my last few taxol treatments so my doc and i decided to stop them and it went away i do have a lot of body stiffness after and sitting still is bad for that for me i hope it gets better but those going through chemo i promise there is an end to it you can get through it i have been done since late june and almost forget the bad days you will too but for now do want you have to get through this shit i hate that you have to do it i went back to work today and god it was good i miss my job i manage about 30 plus men who do maintenance and it is a challenge every day but they are good hardworking kids i always say they make me look good and they have been great through out my journey a little weird today to conduct my morning meeting with all them but i made it through it sending big hugs i am starting my third month on anastrozole and i am doing fine so a bit of joint pain in my dominant hand i am thankful for being so fortunate hi i think everyone has to get benedryl with their herceptin i only have 5 treatments to go and about the halfway mark they let me take just 25 mg as opposed to the 50mgs that they started me with i feel perfectly fine the first few days after the herceptin but usually 4 or 5 days later i become exhausted and get very pale skin with my runny nose it usually gives me diarrhea the day after treatment and also had some issues with hair and nails i did not have chemo first just radiation i also am taking tamoxifen good luck to you not too bad at all julie hi diane join your thread i am also doing 4x of taxol every other week i finished 4x of a c and i think the taxol is easier already done 3 and the main se having from the taxol is body aches they usually hit me around the 3rd day after tx i take advil and ibuprofen for the pain and that helps a bit but still pretty intense for about days i start taking the ibuprofen before the pain gets too bad and continue to take it round the clock been taking to help prevent neuropathy and it seems to be doing ok but i do have one toe on my right foot that is slightly numb and my fingertips are a bit numb as well i run my hands under cold water frequently and that seems to relieve some of it the best part of taxol is that there is no nausea and i had any fatigue the bad part is that my appetite is back in full force and eating everything i am in my late 30 s did dd a c chemo last spring and have had only one menstrual period since then a few months ago since tamoxifen was not good for me i had my first luprun shot last month lo and behold today i am suddenly having a period complete with abdominal cramps i have a call in to my oncologist but is this something i should be very concerned about i ask especially because this oncologist is likely to be a few days in calling me back log in to post a reply i did 4 rounds of adriamycin and cytoxan and just finised 4 rounds of taxol last week i fought shaving my head too and finally when i did i had it shaved with clippers that had an attachment to leave the hair about an inch long after that no more fell out and i had a very very thin short hair for the rest of the time only worn scarves no wigs and never been itchy you need to do what you think be comfortable with it seems people do just about everything there is to deal with it taxol was better and worse overall taxol is easier i was less fatiqued and never felt nauseous it did have a few side effects that were worse i got terrible muscle and joint pain that was hard to control with regular pain stuff advil aleve etc but it only lasted a couple days i also got neuropathy in my fingers and feet and constant not disabling but it was annoying until i started getting used to it they tell me it will go away in time good luck with it a bear but got the strength to get through hi ladies i have a question for those of you who are well along or who have actually finished weekly taxol after having done a previous chemo and lost all your hair be having tx 6 of 12 tomorrow after 9 weeks of dose dense fec after taxol 4 my hair started to fuzz back in a bit mostly on the very top of my head my question is since taxol is cumulative and only barely halfway through can i expect it to continue growing or fall out again as the taxol builds up otherwise pleased to say that feeling better as the weeks go by mouth and throat are still dry as the sahara in august and many foods taste awful but the vicious mouth and throat sores have lightened up so afraid come back as the treatment progresses thanks for any input hi sandy and all my sisters on this journey i now have in my hand tamoxifen and effexor really been emotional this week i finished rads and have been up and down since honestly already having anxiety depression meltdown you name it the forum in now is why was i so much stronger during treatment 2 weeks ago the pharmacy have the ointment for my radiation burns in stock and i just lost it oh well when they have taken my journey they can then make comments now when i pull up to the drive thru they have my things ready so in listing my se from tamox i have to take into account i doing too good beforehand my plan of action is to exercise and get outside as i have not much the last few weeks of rads keep me posted how you guys are doing as you are leading me down tamoxifen road hoping for a smooth ride i was completely miserable with taxol the list of i had is very very long i am close to 4 weeks out from my last treatment i have no fingernails neuropathy loss of appetite daily bloody noses irritated eyes and of course no hair if you have no please please please count your blessings i miss a few days and pages and pages behind i have moved beyond my blues yay my son had to come home from college for a week and the doctors are having a hard time figuring out what is wrong with him i took him back this weekend because he has internship interviews tomorrow as a senior missing a week was already too much i took my daughter to new orleans to take her first of four cpa exams this all reminded me of why i have to pull it together lemon my hair is falling out too i blame it on tamoxifen because when i stop taking it for surgery 3 weeks before 3 weeks after the hair loss stops i start growing hair everywhere are you on tamoxifen goldie and georgie it sounds like we are all moving forward emotionally thank you both for the support sarah keep fighting for your weight loss goal we are all here cheering you on andrea happy you are still here teacher you are going to have to put on the grammar police hat for me thanks for the lie lay hints i live in alabama and work really hard to defy the stereotypes stage 2b is september 26th hello november ladies just checking in on everyone to see how their week went i just had my second taxol on tuesday and my neulasta shot today so based on last time i should be getting my bone pain either tonight or tomorrow tell ya the taxol really kills my taste buds looks like i have thrush again started using my bmx mouthwash again and have a prescription for diflucan hope everyone is doing well carrie got a call from my pcp yesterday saying that my blood sugar levels has risen and i am now at the prediabetic stage she wants to start me on a med that will prevent me from getting diabetes i am still waiting on her to send the medicine to the pharmacist but i believe the med is going to metformin will find out tomorrow i have had so many changes since i have been on anastrozole arimidex my blood pressure spiked depression exhaustion bone pain ibs issues have caused my pcp to try to get ahead by issuing me at least 5 new meds in the last 6 months i was shocked yesterday when i got the call about the new meds to prevent diabetes it is somewhat frightening to me to deal with diabetes as well as cancer will write back tomorrow to confirm her treatment plan would like to know more about metformin i am at least 70 lbs overweight florbo i am fattered that you like my handle leggy yes i had ac x 4 dose dense then 12 weekly t i know the proper shorthand for that yet anyway the hip pain started before i started tamox so i would think that has nothing to do with it except that so many on the tamox board seem to have it the pain and stiffness seem to be decraesing i started taking glutamine about a week ago and my neuropathy is much better i still have it all the time but not as intensely and without the difficult pain i was having at night the result are back on the brca 1 brca 2 test no mutations were found i am so glad that means my family members have to worry as much about carrying a cancer gene it also means no call for a hysterectomy i really would rather stop with the surgeries already hi everyone there are so many different threads here that you might check out the humor ones for a laugh or smile maxine has some priceless comments and i only wish there were some tshirts available i apologize if any on my posting were downers or offensive but having a sounding board to vent and rant and rave with those who know and understand is helpful for me after my husband died 5 years ago i found a grief discussion board and it also had up and down postings in a way it helped see that some of my issues were worse and some were not as bad as others one might call it a reality check and no offense meant and on that board there were some postings that made fun of death and grief and the administrators eventually deleted them but as in person there are jerks idiots and a holes out there who delight in upsetting others and love the attention they get by causing the upsets and i remember that there is a special place in hell for them gag i am not on morphine so no kicking lol luann a gentle hug and a smile for you today there is no way to avoid the negative people or comments they happen maybe we need to write a book comments to those with cancer for dummies one lady i know invited me to join her for dinner a few weeks ago not a good friend more an acquaintance and she went on and on about her husband son finances and hardly let me get a word in edgewise obviously she needed a sounding board and most of my comments were so sorry to hear it or wow you sure have a lot to deal with well i have caller id and avoided answering when she phoned ran into her recently and said i am dealing with a lot of issues myself and busy trying to get my life in order i will phone you when i have more time you are the one who can choose some things to change eliminate or avoid and there are other things that cannot be changed or avoided i could be called selfish or self centered but i choose to be good to and for myself of course along the way there are things that do upset or bother me but i try not to dwell on them and music is one way i can escape my ipod is recharged each night when i go to sleep i am sooo sorry to hear of your issues and sorry is not the best word it sucks i took my can cover with cancer sucks on it to chemo yesterday and everyone loved it 2 words that says it all speaking of chemo i had mega hot flashes with the taxol my first tx with it even my toe nails were sweating got a shot of steroid which then make the nether region burn like on fire which is what is supposed to do wtf sweat burn holy cow did not get the name of it but i told nurse no more of that shit and they were backed up big time started tx at ended at due to stop taxol give steroid wait and all vitals were good then slow drip of taxol to avoid more s e btw by the way i am 62 and thought hot flashes were a thing of the past will close with good news tumor is down 50 and if this keeps up i will have lump instead of mast once chemo is done in october hugs and blessings nancy ginagina so glad that i could help be sure to google abraxane there is a good patient information site from the pharm manufacturer the taxols are usually dissolved in cremophor which is the allergic stimuli and that is why everyone gets steroids and benedryl as a prep for treatment taxotere requires hours for administration and abraxane requires only 30 minutes followed by your other chemo agents it sounds like the 1st taxotere treatment sensitized you also mine went in really easy but i only managed to get a few drops the 2nd time before my reaction i received chemo every 3 weeks but after i had the allergic reaction and since i did not get taxotere that week they brought me in a few days later and gave me the abraxane so that i did not miss that part of the cycle you will still have all of the risk for that the taxols possess the hair loss neuropathy taste changes etc abraxane does not change that at all i actually remember all of the now that it is a year later but i still have the peripheral neuropathy in my fingers and feet be sure to tell your nurse and md if you start to feel tingling pains and or numbness in your hands feet they need to know that as it starts happening and sometimes they forget to ask hope you have a good weekend hang in there yesterday was bittersweet it was my last tc tx but not uneventful with gerd symptoms starting approx 15 minutes into taxotere no iv med on hand except for zantac which i am allergic to so had to resort to 4 melt away strips and a handful of tums symptoms subsided but kept twinging the rest of the day and came back full blown a few hrs after i left the center worst part is that they admitted my mom to the hospital in the middle of the night since she is not responding to the meds for salmonella and is getting progressively worse may i ask you to pray for her please thank you bon zjrosenthal i have the itching on the back of my left hand really odd as i get taxol every tuesday and every saturday night the itching drives me completely insane so weird hubby got mad at me because we went to dinner on a saturday night and i stop scratching lol dancingdiva i too get some blood in my nose with huge bloody sorry this is gonna be gross lol boogers disgusting thanks missingmercury i hope your neuropathy gets better quickly for you toby thanks for the good thoughts how is it going with the cmf skigirl i admire you if you can make it to the gym it seems that if i do anything extra that i pay for it with severe muscle pain a little later in the day i love to exercise and have my own little gym my normal routine was up at am to work out i have really missed that as done nothing since starting chemo well done a little yoga since being on taxol but even that seems to make my back hurt this week after been my worst week on taxol i have felt pretty bad all week but tomorrow is the last one i have an appointment with my ro on monday looking forward to getting a start and end date for this last leg of treatment hope everyone has a good day my sister is taking herceptin treatment after chemotherapy fec and she has severe headaches which are getting worse after more treatment she has had four treatments the headaches usually start the next day after a treatment and a painkiller the doctor gives her work she sometimes vomits the headache continues days and is eventually gone in 5 days after that she is basically fine her doctor is checking blood test everytime and the result is normal information from several websites says that that side effects such as headaches occur only after the first or second treatments my questions are 1 she seems one of the rare patients to have such severe headaches what is the possible cause of her severe headache 2 she is taking a japanese herbal medication for reducing hot flashes which seems to work well for the flashes do you think her severe headache is related to this herbal medication 3 does such a severe headache indicate that herception treatment is harmful for her could you please give any advice thank you in advance hi there i am so thankful for this online community and especially this thread i have bc but my mom is stage iv bones liver and since she is also new to the site but tired almost all the time i am her voice on the site and i thought share her story she was originally diagnosed 20 years ago in 1994 it came back in 2004 and more recently in 2011 you would think that after two times of making appearances that bc would leave her alone but as you know there is no rhyme or reason more often than not at the time of her iv diagnosis a few years ago we were in complete shock and devastated i am an only child very close to her and i just had my first daughter after the initial shock and the start of treatments she seemed to be in a good place thankfully with minimal side effects from hormonal treatment she is er that kept her bone liver mets stable and sometimes making them smaller her qol for the first three years after that was almost as good as before unfortunately a few months ago she was started experiencing some pain and changes to her body and her tumor markers went up after a new chemo her symptoms got worse and scans showed progression now she is on taxotere and will be starting her second treatment of it on thursday she is losing her hair for the first time and my husband and dad have shaved their heads as well for awhile she was having pain for months and we are thankful that the last week the pain has subsided for the first time in a long time whether or not that means that the tumors are shrinking only the scans will tell later on praying hoping fingers crossed that these tumors shrink i know i am only a bystander when it comes to bc my mom has faced this beast three times and when i think of the kind of person she is so incredibly kind patient generous and just an incredibly human being it really breaks my heart that she has had to go through this why so many of you have to but i am equally grateful that cancer take her the first time the second time and that after three years of this third time she is still here and that little newborn i had during her iv diagnosis will be turning four next month and my mom was also there for the births of our second third daughters and maybe even welcome a fourth in a year or two i know cancer is so unpredictable for her and she can go from the valley to the mountaintop back to the valley again i love this site and the support that you give each other because so contagious i am naturally a very anxious worrisome think the worst type of person and this website has pointed me in the direction of hope and to look at the bright side thank you all xo sarah kay 1963 any idea why the glucosamine condroiton would be bad for us 6 months into tamoxifen and in agony with joint hip and back i wake up every night from the pain already taking fish oil and exercising to keep the joints moving but awful still no periodx 1 yearso sure estrogen depletion is compounding the pain i was considering glucosamine condroitin but i want to if contraindicated i had a reaction about 4 weeks into the taxol herceptin combination which my oncologist attributed to the taxol after the taxol ended and herceptin continued the rash got worse and i itched from the top of my head to my feet we tried everything benadryl atarax he finally agreed that the itching was due to herceptin but of course i did not want to stop the medicine finally my primary care physician prescribed xyzal a once a day evening pill that stopped the itching within 24 hours it was amazing no side effects from it either i stayed on that for about 8 weeks and tolerated it extremely well finally the itching went away althought i am still on herceptin occasionally i feel a little itchy if i am out in the sun and physically active but it resolves with a shower and going inside if i need to i will not think twice about going back on the xyzal my recommendation to you is let them tell you that it be the herceptin doctors tend to point their fingers at other doctors frankly i care what the culprit was i just wanted relief it took a primary care physician someone out of the loop to just start prescribing until i found relief oh and also take zantac i know that most people consider it to be for stomach issues but it is an that will affect allergy like symptoms and it helped along with the xyzal one a day hope this helps hi alldexxy i went to that link and was really thinking about ordering it i know spirulina and several of the other ingredients are great for immune system but then i saw soybean lecithinand guessing for me being er i take anything with anyone tell me what essential oils are good for hair regrowth i am pretty sure someone mentioned rosemary was one anything else that is pretty good with helping the hair grow back anyone else get hair regrowth during taxol i have been on taxol for 6 weeks now and my hair is well over an inch very fuzzy like a new chickadee lol but my onco said about all get until completely done with txs 16 days to go and counting xoxo thanks for all your support ladies it took me all evening to catch up on posts but i think i finally managed to catch up through when i posted last but got a little lazy after that so have to the posts from today tomorrow since i need to get to bed i hope i can pop on again tomorrow before my first taxol treatment on tuesday but i do have to work so probably be evening before i log on wishing everyone hitting the chemo chair tomorrow an uneventful and s e free treatment rabbit surprised you got af this far into chemo i seen had mine since june 22nd sorry your 3rd round uneventful and that you suffered from a bad migraine my onc told me that zofran can cause bad headaches for some people they switched me to kytril after my first treatment because i had a bad migraine but it really prevent me from getting migraines in treatments 2 3 none in 4 so who knows as for speaking at your school i wonder if you can contact the american cancer society for some literature and congrats on the tumor shrinking great news as for getting our schedules posted on the first post of this thread i did pm em0909 a while back and never heard back should we start a new thread dexxy you sound quite busy with the painting and fixing of things i think you should be okay with the occasional beer if you feel up to it i really been drinking during chemo but every now and then take a sip of my glass of wine just to have the taste frankenboobs how did your 2nd round go mine was better than the first though i have a different regimen hope it was for you too i think for me it was just that i learned from mistakes i made during my first round hydration is key btw i also had light sensitivity and want to be touched in my first round along with a bunch of other side effects you experienced luebbsgurl congrats on the baby news i hope things work out this time for your son and dil hard enough with a miscarriage let alone losing a baby shortly after birth as for forgetting to put your cover on when your food was delivered that happened to me too recently our apartment complex had sent notices saying that maintenance would be coming in to check our smoke detectors they do this annually and i had pulled out my scarf to cover up and just completely forgot to put it on dh told me after they left and i was amazed i just feel so comfortable without any coverings did you ever get your trip to the mountains as for the neulasta surprised they cited age as the reason for not giving it to you 28 and have had to give myself the shot each time mavinbook i wish i read your post about eating the shaved ice before my last ac treatment i find that my tongue is numb starting the week after chemo all the way up to my next treatment ugh snoopy it does seem to take about 10 days to start feeling normal again after each treatment and then suddenly bam next treatment ana lol about the red wig and showing a different side of your personality i honestly thought be wearing my wig a lot but i have found that i feel quite comfortable in my head covers wraps scarves so grateful that my sil surprised me with that package in the mail i can mix them up with whatever wearing great as for that biking wax i am disappointed it was coming out like crazy and then just stopped i was so hoping for the brazilian sandy how did your second treatment go hopefully better than the first ellenquilt i have yet to have the runs from chemo i am constantly suffering from constipation dealing with hemorrhoids so every bm hurts your experience from your 4th taxol makes me nervous for my first dose dense one on tuesday i hope doing better now and thanks for the info on what your allergist said about taxol i have a number of allergies myself so it would not surprise me if i get a reaction this week have to ask about the stabilizing chemical glad that they gave you something else instead of the taxol after the problems had is it still weekly love the bald head picture by the way you have a nice shaped head like me the first wig pic you posted looks like real hair the 2nd does too but a little less natural amethyst 11 sorry i never responded to your post to me i have heard herceptin that bad except that you have to do it for a year but compared with the chemo supposed to be easier like you said everyone is different so sure there is at least one person out there who would disagree with that i found that the chemo weeks necessarily get harder each time but the time it takes for me to feel better in my off week is a bit longer each time misswim how is your fatigue hard to work and go through chemo at the same time i did that back in december 2010 february 2011 and it was brutal after i got the breast cancer diagnosis in april i decided not to push myself so much this time make sure you get the rest you need feel guilty about taking time off as you need it either and i agree with dexxy walks do help wow that wbc was high at i am lucky to have mine at but my neutrophils were just though had them hit before with the i received for the molar pregnancy so i know it could be worse i just barely made the cutoff for chemo last time i will see how it is this upcoming tuesday surprised still have you get the neulasta shot after such a high count maybe they could have given you a little break phillybird your the chair comment had me giggling pinkpalette i have had my snappy moments too since starting chemo and lack of sleep certainly contributes we are nearly on the same schedule i finished my last ac on the august 9th and go this tuesday for my first taxol not really looking forward to a different drug with who knows what symptoms i keep hearing about the excruciating bone pain the neuropathy some people losing their nails and eyebrows and the potential of an allergic reaction i hope it goes smoothly for both of us this week thanks for the latisse post i will check it out sorry about the overworking director clearly he recognize work home balance hope things get better this week with your manager back as for the palpitations i would measure your heart rate to see what it is i called the on call doctor late one night because i was scared and my heart rate was only barely over 100 though pretty high for me and made me uncomfortable he think i needed to go to the er or anything and told me 140s resting heart rate would be concerning but not low 100s and said our hearts can handle quite a bit still mention it to your onc though i plan on telling mine too honey i had a period in about 2 months last one was just before starting chemo whether it comes back varies from person to person only 28 and hoping to someday have children so praying it comes back for me i take it rather not have it back hope we both get our wishes as for your neutrophils sounds like the nuepogen did job maybe they want you to get the neulasta so it fall too low again as for avoiding soy i think so much an issue for you since er negative i think soy is something those of us with er tumors need to limit as for the receptors my understanding that the receptors are tumor specific if you had two tumors even in the same breast they could have different receptor statuses mommaof 4 i received a halo wig when i went to the wig bank put on by the american cancer society only worn it once though i ended up gravitating towards wearing scarves but i do like the idea if you like wearing hats and want to look like you have hair jamie had some bad luck with the chemo burns i wish you had a port would have been so much less painful in that regard i am really happy that ths of the way done kind of jealous actually i just hit the halfway mark 4 down 4 to go catron sorry been feeling so lousy and that it seems to be worse each time for you i hope the next 3 treatments fly by for the next treatment take the meds since harder to stop the nausea once it hits paintingmywaythru sorry you were feeling lousy last round i had never heard of lichen plantis but it sound fun hopefully the chemo does put it in remission as for your artwork very nice ybrooker 1 sorry your 2nd treatment go too smoothly 5kidsmom sorry your daughter has disease we know someone who has battled that as well i hope the fact that been diagnosed will help get her on the road to feeling better horrible not knowing why feeling so lousy as for the picc i had a picc line for 6 weeks earlier this year when i was getting chemo for my molar pregnancy crap it was awful i did learn to live with it but i had to cover it up every time i showered and in the middle of winter i was having trouble getting it under my sleeves so i had to wear only loose clothing the worst part of it was the dressings and having to get them changed weekly i ended up being allergic to tegaderm dressings which is what they use now too to cover ports when they access them i have to remind them each time i hope your daughter have the picc anymore and that it was just for her hospital stay and i also hope you need a picc line izzy sorry you had a crappy tc 2 how was 3 hoping you find out that the lump is just a cyst please keep us posted blessomel what were your counts when you were turned away for treatment if you mind me asking as for the hair i felt like you until i had dh buzz it off after that a sense of relief and actually enjoyed my bald well buzzed head the rest of my hair stopped falling out shortly after we buzzed it lol but much easier to maintain i know when done with the chemo going to want it back pronto but i have an excuse to have no hair and i have come to love the shape of my head memasue 56 i think if you want a shot or two of jose cuervo you should have it i really wanted alcohol since starting chemo but important to find enjoyment where you can what chemo regimen are you on so sorry about your dh leaving for vacation with someone else let alone another woman you deserve someone to be by your side all the time while we all know that bc just affect us but also our loved ones and caretakers not like any of us chose to go through this you definitely deserve better melissaw welcome i also had 4 rounds of ac and am now starting 4 rounds of dose dense taxol taken claritin for the bone pain and so far been fairly mild cathy_c hope doing well with your last ac how nice that you get a break between your ac and taxotere herceptin mohonda welcome to the group but so sorry here and that this your first go round with chemo i home the lxempra does the trick as for being short of breath and feeling the blood pounding i wonder if anemic that has caused these symptoms for me bcisnofun i have the exact same issue with bowel movements i know torn something and it cuts it back open every time i go i also want a break when you wipe do you get small amounts of blood on the tp too been using to help with the discomfort it does help even if just a little as for food restrictions i recall having any in particular that they told me about maybe they just assumed already pretty informed either that or my chemo brain just remember i did attend a chemo class after my 1st treatment and was told that the no eating unpeeled fruits or raw veggies thing is actually an older recommendation from the american cancer society but they have since removed the recommendation saying it need to be followed unless wbc counts are too low paulamati congrats on getting halfway through chemo i have had my ice cream moments too cool and non abrasive for my tongue my sil made me some blueberry frozen yogurt with very little sugar added makes me feel better about indulging from time to time linda welcome i also went on disability because i know important for my recovery i know we all have that option though i am now back to work part time with disability for the days i work and working from home but only because fmla only covered me for 12 weeks and i want to have to pay for cobra to keep my medical benefits mikamomof 3 welcome and congrats on finishing ac and moving on to taxotere good to be done with the nasty red stuff frances good luck with round 4 of chemo tomorrow you will pass the halfway hurdle cshell welcome to the group i also technically started in june june 28th shinypop interesting about the protein being necessary after a mastectomy i suppose i should up my protein intake to help in that department smrlvr i had the same treatment just before surgery ac made me feel a little sick like morning sickness even with the meds but once i got through a couple of treatments i knew there was a light at the end of the tunnel and could deal it debilitating for me taxol was painful for me i had bone pain with that one that was made worse by the neulasta shot it did have me curled up in a ball a few days of the week with both ac and taxol the symptoms started about a day or two after the treatment would peak at about 3 to 4 days and would steadily get better as the week went on the good news is you may not have any of these symptoms and if you do the meds may help you through even though i hated neulasta with a passion i got through cold and flu season with nary a sneeze so it worked everyone reacts differently it did shrink my large tumor i did not have a complete response but it did shrink significantly and i had clean margins at surgery kelli thanks for all the replies ladiespeblos 20 interesting that you are her 2 like me when i started smelling the sweet smell i was only on tamoxifen currently i am on herceptin and perjecta and faslodex and arimedex hmmm where are your are bone and liver perhaps it has to do with digestive issues this is definitely a possiblity i already checked for the sinus infection and it thanks for your help all i think this is a great combo and bravo for the onc that this was not sure if oncs were given chemo with herceptin and tykerb but glad to see someone is starting this from my experience if i was this this would be benign treatment meaning i would not know i was on anything besides my hair thinning ever so lightly however that is not experience my experience on these drugs not given in this combo however herceptin tell taking medication however your friend will need to get her heart checked every now and then to confirm that herceptin in not dropping her ejection fraction to low if it gets too low they take you off the herceptin for a while been on this drug for many years and my heart has never gotten low enough to go off navelbine mildest chemo ever been on that is not true for everyone but for me it was some folks have constipation issues w this chemo so she may need to take natural laxatives or whatever works for her the day of tx and for a few days after it worked the best so far at hitting my mets but only worked for 6 months had i known that other women like konakat got great results by also adding carboplatin to the navelbine i would have done that before going to a new tx tykerb i was only on this drug for 6 weeks but i had zero s that is rare most women get diahrrea zits and maybe a rash others that have been on this drug long term will post their s apparently an oil that you can get at whole foods called suki pure facial moisture nourishing that is very effective at making the rash go away if the rash appears i bought some just in case but never needed it i think this is a very humane combo and should be very effective hth kim ok so i am almost to my 5th bottle of tamoxifen i have done great up until the last few weeks does anyone else just feel weird i explain it really i just feel odd different sometimes its like a fog or drunk feeling sometimes the anxiety surfaces and sometimes the depression a lot more tired this is getting old does it get better over time please tell me it does hello everyone this is my first post ever on any discussion board a friend recently told me about this site and i thought i would check it out my journey officially began on december 22nd 2013 when i went for a routine mam got a call on january 3rd to go back for a second which i did on january 24th 2014 got a call a week later and scheduled my appointment with breast surgeon went for and biopsy and was diagnosed on day with breast cancer estrogen progesterone her 2 1 originally scheduled for left lumpectomy radiation and hormone drug therapy that plan quickly changed after the mri when my surgeon told me that she was not comfortable with margins and how my breast would look after the surgery after weighing the pros and cons i decided to not take any chances and went for the mastectomy had the surgeryin april alongwith sentinel node dissection the results on the nodes during surgery were negative so the plastic surgeon started the reconstruction process and inserted the expander got a call a week later from my bs and the final pathology indicated 1 out of the two nodes were positive back to surgery in may to remove the rest of the nodes left side total of 6 more and all were negative since i had one positive node i was now faced with having to go through chemotherapy which i was hoping would not happen i was devastated as you can well imagine i remember how numb i felt after meeting with the oncologist and oncologist nurse to discuss the treatment protocol and all the side effects everything that i had to consider 4 a c followed by 4 taxol i also remember telling my husband upon leaving the facility that i did not belong there this was not happening to me we were both depressed at that moment i was out of work for a total of six weeks during the surgery process and went back end of may i have a demanding job and i travel days a week started chemo on june 4th lost hair after 1st treatment andjust before 2nd treatment that was difficult only wear wig at work as i cannot stand having it on my head finished a c and had my first taxol treatment a week ago i am still working a full schedule and traveling except for the day of chemo it is getting harderand harderwith each treatment i feel grateful that my side effects have not been severe had nausea and fatigue with a c and after my first taxol have had significant pain in lower extremities and praying that does not continue through next 3 treatments i still have to finish reconstruction hopefully before year end and i will go on hormone therapy for 5 years so icontinue to be a work in progress still scared nervous and wondering how i will feel when this is all behind me i am turning 58 next week thanks for listening and feel free to offer any advice since i am new to this whole sharing concept are any of you ladies having problems with edema and inflammation of the brain mets during xelodai was in the hospital again yesterday for brain swelling edema and a massive headache was given fentanyl for the pain and dexamethasone for swelling headaches are a little better but taking a lot of pain meds the fentanyl they gave me in the hospital made me vomit up the dex so although it was helping i lost the dosage on the way home hoping its a tumour flare since all my cancer sites are aching anyone else experience this thanks karen mbf welcome sorry having problems with tamoxifen i do have lots of hot flashes they started as soon as i went off hrt but they as bad as they were when i first started menopause on good nights i wake up throw off the covers doze off get cold wake up and pull up the covers and go back to sleep it happens 2 or 3 times a night on the bad nights i have a hard time going back to sleep and stay awake for hours right now had 3 good nights in a row so i hope a for a couple years i completely stopped drinking in january but i like that too drastic for me i love a glass of wine with my dinner and yes i know drinking increases the risk of recurrence but i care not giving it up i take my pill in the am with my multivitamin joint pills the joys of middle age and milk seems to work for me i think gained or lost weight but i weighed myself recently love to think that losing but i think wishful thinking no lightheadedness for me i have my two month follow up with my mo next week michcon after my first tx with taxotere cytoxan and herceptin i did have a very funky sore and swollen throat i thought i was coming down with something and realize for a couple of days that it might be the chemo duh but that round was when i been fully hydrated and i had all sorts of ses the worst being the headache from hell as far as steroids go the mo said he gives everyone dexamethasone tablets to take bid the day before day of and day after taxotere plus with each tx i got dexamethasone iv to ward off inflammation i just had my 2nd muga this week have the results yet but think it is ok here they do a baseline muga and then one every 3 months while on herceptin was told that if the ejection fraction gets to 55 or below they will stop giving herceptin ps they sent mom home last night she is happy to be out of hospital prison and away from that dietitian who helping anything mom is still pretty weak but eager to get back to her routine working with her gi doc to give her a very restrictive and controlled diet until the diarrhea stops and the inflammation is down then we will slowly reintroduce certain foods grateful you allowed me to vent here about this for the last 8 days and am grateful for your prayers and concern when i was terrified for her and for me thank you and mom thanks you too you might find more interest in the her 2 threads maybe the mods can move this thread to the her board i chose herceptin without tamoxifen or chemo both strongly recommended i am sooo glad that i chose only herceptin had enough problems in adjusting to the herceptin infusions and imagine what it would had been like doing more my husband read in the paper this week that there is a study going on now for women doing herceptin only without chemo most have side effects with the herceptin infusions have had several side effects after the second infusion my ef went down 15 pts someone suggested coq 10 which has helped a lot it brought my ef up to 55 developed strong palpitations from the herceptin weird to hear your heart pounding not as bad as it was after the first 2 infusions read somewhere that taking weekly herceptin is easier on the heart for this reason trying the weekly infusions for the next 3 months the other side effects for me are fatigue slower wound healing eyes and lower immunity more mouth sores canker since starting herceptin hope it goes well with you eva doing cmf called chemo light because easier than adriamycin it used to be the main treatment before adrimycin came along the c is the same as in ac t had three treatments so far five left to go it used to be the main treatment before adriamycin came along so far had my bad days with nausea and fatigue a little bit of a problem with mouth sores but it gets a lot better after a few days one trick people taught me is to chew ice during the 5 fu to cut down on mouth sores but now whenever i look at ice cubes i start to get queasy glad doing so well on it mindy ann sorry having to go thru this again i lost my hair the first time three wks after my first chemo treatment it was the dead of winter and cold so i wore mostly winter hats i also had a wig but it was really hot and itchy so the hats were more comfortable six months later after my mastectomy my onc put me on taxotere and told me my hair would fall out again my hair had come back in salt and pepper for some reason only the dark hair fell out leaving me with thin gray hair but i still had hair my onc believe that it all come out when it came back in it was all gray if i were you i shave your head just yet it could be that all of your hair fall out even if too thin to go without a wig or your halo having even a thin layer of hair underneath should make it more comfortable i have a small head too so i can relate to your pinhead description when i was bald i looked like the little old man from the old benny hill shows one night i was sitting at my computer about 5 feet directlyin front of me was a window i hadhad the window openedearlier so the blind was raised suddenly ilooked at the window and sawwhat appeared to bean old man peering in the window at me i jumped back and started to scream for my husband then i realized it an old man it was me if i would lose my hair again i would try one of the halos too most of theheat and itching from my wig was right at the top i have a headband with bangs attached that i used to wear under caps and hats let us know how you like your halo when you get it jan hello ladies i am so glad that i have found this board like you i too am having difficulty sleeping or even staying asleep my first month on tamoxifen i slept great but now the pharmacy switched brands on me to mylen and i am exhausted last rx was the brand watson my sleep was very restful today i took the pill in the morning to see if that might help i will try some of the suggestions made on here it is really disappointing to hear that some drs are in disbelief that insomnia is not a side effect i have never had trouble sleeping until now hoping we all get rest some rest soon i never did buzz my hair but did cut it short the day it started to fall out i know a woman who just finished tch this summer and the only se she had was her hair fell out and i think a little taste change after tx 6 i did have some light hot flashes no sweats between am i slept through most of them they gradually disappeared even once i started anastrozole no moods swings either oh and although i did have some rare se nail lifting i never had any nausea other than the emend i never used any of the drugs they gave me for that everyone is different so assume the worst hi i started my chemo on may 21st my protocol isac x 4 every other week and then taxol every week for 12 wks i just found your group today after my first chemo i had severe nausea for 8 hours pretty bad but i had a good second day next came the neulasta and joint pain i also have a heartburn knot in the back of my throat have tried zantac with little relief on the up side i do yoga every day that i can restorative poses and walk about 30 minutes i also do deep relaxation with cd about healing all this helps but the journey is just beginning hello my name is pat and from the feb board and noticed in the same treatment schedule as several of you ladies here can i chime in every so often i had a rt mastectomy on 07 for a cm mass ilc triple neg nodes clear one close margin but dr says no indication for rads after chemo my oncologist is great and trust her with all my heart to do the right thing i just had 9 of 12 taxols this past wed and before that had the 4 ac the was he my main problem during this whole thing has been the fatigue although the taxol is much more tolerable yesterday the only thing i could muster was deciding where to lay down the sofa or bed i am the single mother of a 22yr old dd who has been fantastic during this ordeal thank goodness today i woke up feeling much more like myself been on disability since surgery and plan to return to work on 07 last chemo is 07 mel hope doing well kept up with your postings and no chemo always knock out positive nodes really something how everyones body reacts differently to chemo as heard of large 7 tumors dissappearing totally and smaller ones not having same results try not to second guess too much it will make you nuts thank you pat been on 20 mg tamoxifen for about 6 weeks now i get any hot flashes but i have insomnia which seems to be getting worse i sleep for about 3 or 4 hours and then it do any of you have this also i am no longer dreaming which is a bad sign for me the other symptom is occasional waves of mild pain around the sacral area hope nothing else for those of you taking effexor does it hep with sleep i had to go off prozac before i started tamoxifen thanksgerri also makes goves and slippers for chemo taxotere is hard on the nails i heard about the hats and gloves after my first treatment i had already started to loose my hair but decided to try to save my nails i have 2 pair of gloves and change them after 45 min my onc has a freezer so i carry my gloves on ice packs and put them in their freezer to keep them cold i have one white line across each nail from the one treatment when i have the gloves but otherwise my nails look great i keep ice in my mouth during the drip to save my taste buds i made half size ice cubes which fit in my mouth better than a full cube i start icing 15 min before and continue through the drip and 15 min after i have managed to save my taste buds when i use the ice with no mouth sores and no fuzzy tongue for my fourth treatment i decided to try to save what is left of my eyebrows i took sandwich bags and put 2 cubes of ice in each bag and rested it on my glasses so the ice was on my eyebrows and then i put a headband across my forehead to hold it on we will see if if works the ice lasted about minutes so they had to be changed often my daughter or husband go with me each time to help me with my icing i have ordered an sinus pac to see if that will work it would cover the eyebrows but also covers the eyes so might save eyelashes too i just wonder what it will be like to sit blindfolded for the 2 hours they are not expensive and would need to be changed out every 30 minutes noor you have a new avatar with two beautiful horses but again the pic is so small please post the enlarged picture i sure enjoyed when you did that before pmr please send your dh to teach my dh how to bbq my dh can only make hard boiled eggs and ham and cheese on wheat no kidding he can inspect a gorilla rig in the gulf of mexico and find a loose bolt but he find that butter hugs to your mom dstar yes i had 29 nodes removed 27 were in a cluster near my arm pit i was so glad to know they were negative but at first i was angry that they caused le i have since learned that i could get le from just the 2 nodes removed in my breast thanks cancer i hear your ready to start healing loud and clear i searched bco for others who had a reaction to taxol i think i found six several had a different reaction and actually restarted their infusions once they were stable i was told taxol was over and be sure to always list it as an allergy i think i have a little ptsd from this scare as i stop reliving it and questioning each step in my mind maybe it was the premed steroids doing it but i just concentrate on anything else still obsessing over the panic i felt when i thought i was losing consciecness sorry but it still brings on tears i think try yoga too hi susan arlene thanks for the compliments arlene so sorry you had to spend the day in the er thanks for sharing though i will increase my intake of foods rich in magnesium and potassium for sure your are so right about being your own advocate i had to battle my onc for weeks as to where i get my infusions he has his own center and the hospital has their own his center was not the ideal environment it was extremely crowded and very understaffed so i chose to go to the hospital where there were 10 chairs and 4 nurses we also had to battle over pre meds i wanted a benedryl drip and he did not but after 5 min on taxotere drip i started having heavy breathing and chest tightness then they gave me a benedryl drip after reading so many stories on the boards you learn that there is really on a few ways to skin this cat not a hundred like usually in life i hope you feel better and the se subside for you soon the unknown every three weeks is the scariest part for ne i started with acth i will be getting ac every other week x4 and taxol every other week x4 with herceptin weekly x12 then every three weeks completing one year the worst day for me was the friday i had body aches from the neulasta head congestion and a headache the headache lasted one week i took tylenol as advised no advil or aspirin and sudafed daily and rested which seem to help i was told by the nurse that the cytoxan causes head congestion the last five minutes of infusion the congestion lasted all week but i wonder if it was because i returned from honeymoon and it was related to the 12 hour plane ride and jet lag i returned to work the following week and have my next treatment i was told the drugs are cumulative and the effects after second treatment are worse have to see hi new to this site and have read through as much as i can its very reassuring to find out that like me others are suffering the side effects of tamoxifen been taking it for 3 months following lumpectomy chemo and radio fortunately i have hot flushes depression or headaches but do suffer badly from joint paint in my shoulders back hips and knees especially in the morning and after sitting i was unaware that tamoxifen was made by a variety of drug manufacturers and am interested in comments if they have changed from one manufacturer to another and shown improvement also does it make any difference to side effects if you take tamoxifen in the morning or during the day rather than at night i was initally told by my onc that my body would become acustomed to tamoxifen within 6 months from what read this does not seem to be the case tried paracetamol and ibuprofen but it makes no difference to the joint pain i have just started taking a daily dose of 50 mgs of diclofenac to see if that has any effect if you have been affected by any of the above or can offer any advice love to hear from you after first tx yesterday i was down my liver enzymes were sky high so they halved my dose of adriamycin left with a slight headache came home set my alarm to take the zofran when the nurse said too woke up to take it and went back to sleep then up 1 hours later full on headache want to take anything because of liver enzymes which could be from the hydrocodone that i have been taking since my surgery i have been weaning since last week and now that wearing ace bandage compression i have been able to almost stop it so the headache could be a rebound still have it but not near as last night hope today will be better i go for my neulasta shot today and mil is taking me next tx i will be the test study for the on body injector from what i understand is the hospital pharmacy have been dragging their feet because they think the will get paid by the ins companies which they will and if it is a case they the rep said that amgen company that makes it will pay it all so next tx i will be getting it and that makes me happy because one less trip since it is an hour away i think i am sleepy enough again so hoping to go back to sleep will catch up more later 16 hours ago mamajen 60 wrote i realize the anxiety yal feel my health is ibc idc brac 2 hers 2 pos er pr neg stage 3 b grade 3 due to heart problems thanks to chemo oct 2013 had

with a cough and it has progressed to a chronic cough and shortness of breath i am going to a pulmonologist and he has run tests to determine that the taxane drugs have caused my lungs and bronchoial airways to become inflammed so now he has recommened that i not take any more taxane drugs right now been on a 2 week chemo break so that i can recover and try to regain some strenght also lost about 40 pounds and am having trouble eating hard to eat when you can breathe been searching but seem to find anyone else who is experiencing what i have been experiencing if i have the shortness of breath cough i would be doing really good tink c hello all been on tamoxifen for less than a month and i have been getting pelvic pressure and lower back pain it also feels like the start of a bladder infection but it hurt when i pee i go from feeling like i might have to pee to omg get me to a bathroom i have to pee i get a terrible deep ache when i have to go thank goodness i found this thread i have an appointment with my onc next wednesday but wondering if i should just call the gyno warriorwoman 1 turtlenecks i personally think it would be an issue if you are careful putting them on taking them off try to pull out on the neck area with my hands while pulling it over my head 2 eye color change on latisse very small risk but it happens in certain cases usgdb 4uzkpgaccording to the fda lumigan which uses the same formulation as latisse may gradually change eye color increasing the amount of brown pigment in the iris a change that occurs slowly and may not be noticeable for several months to years doctors however say this side effect is associated exclusively with dropping medication directly into the eye as opposed to painting it along the upper lash line and that its extremely rare based on collective experience people with crystal clear blue eyes dont develop the iris pigmentation says dr arielle kauvar clinical associate professor of dermatology at new york university school of medicine the people who are susceptible to it are individuals with brown eyes or hazel eyes or eyes but the overall risk is less than 1 percent and thats with the medication going directly into the eye and directly from website marguerite mcdonald ophthalmologist this is one of the most common questions i get asked latisse use may cause increased brown iris pigmentation of the colored part of the eye which is likely to be permanent while very infrequent increased iris pigmentation has occurred when latisse solution was administered do not apply latisse in your eye or to the lower lid ask your doctor for complete application instructions i have blue eyes and just willing to take the risk despite the first doc above saying it happen to crystal blue eyes i do have some green in them now if i lost all my eyelashes and they grow back well consider taking the risk my lashes did thin and when they grew back i have one area that super thick but i can mask it with a certain mascara i lost half my brows 4 weeks post chemo but they grew back in super fast within a week or so 3 drinking warm water the whole time never heard that one i definitely would recommend chewing on ice during tax 15 min prior and post too so hours of ice chips i do this consistently after my first tch and developed a few mouth sores i was more religious about the ice chips my next 3 rounds and had no mouth sores thrush yes but that is different from mouth sores as for icing nails toes i did that too and let me tell you cold caps plus icing mouth and nails sucked for that hours it made cold caps alone a breeze seriously the cold caps seemed like nothing compared to icing the nails so you will have to decide for yourself on the icing of the nails toes it is pretty brutal imo to do all of that together still glad i did it b c of no nail issues but as jc254 said plenty of women ice nails and have nail issues impossible to predict if that will be an issue for you or not i did 3 weekly taxols before changing to doxil around week 4 or 5 my hair started coming out in small clumps i just had it cut really short it has already stopped coming out and iam just left with a really short bob i just tease the areas that are a little thin but i alreadyhad thin hair to begin with i am not sure what the doxil will do to my hair i get monthly doxil i have had one doxil treatment and i get the next on on may 12th hth its is day 6 post taxol and my bone pain has gone away completely i do not have any nausea or tingling in the fingers funny but the bottoms of my feet hurt i taste salt either i had the nail lifting etc big time on taxotere 6 rounds now a year pfc and i still have several lifted fingernails they are also a little tender nails are thick brittle with big vertical ridges top edges still have that smoker brown color my toes are brittle ridges too anyone know when this will get better or if it will get better i used to have such nice fingernails i never polished them before now i have to because they look so crappy too much maintenance log in to post a reply hi stargazerlilly i am also on tamoxifen herceptin i have been taking a supplement called biotin available from h b not expensive but was told by other ladies on the american bc website that it helps with your hair thinning due to the tamoxifen and so far my hair is growing back quite quickly and thicker than it was before also i use a natural product called himalayan herbal for hair loss its a natural product cream that you put on your hair before you go to bed at night and this is supposed to help the texture of your hair certainly something is working like i said my hair is thicker darker and stronger than it was before i lost it all hope this helps love and light sarahlousie xxx hi tac sisters i hope everyone is doing well mindy i can relate to the hot flashes i have about 4 or 5 a nite i guess i will have to ask my doc for different meds darlene hang in there today and know we are all

wednesday july 12 i start radiation for the next 33 days i will be on these boards cheering each one of you crossing the finish line you all have been so helpful to me thanks to all marcia hvv awesome i keep hoping to see some growth heard of women having hair growing back during taxol but maybe only on the weekly since a lower dose nothing on my head except baldness lol my eyebrows are really thinning out now too hi everyone just wanted to pop in to let you know that for now i will be continuing tamoxifen i saw the gyn onc today and nothing was really resolved the fsh lh test proves that i am indeed post menopausal but when i mentioned switching from tamoxifen to an ai i also said are bad for my bones he just said well i have no problem with you staying on tamoxifen well i told him that i do not want to have another d c so if these things grow back i will be mad anyway he said that he will call my onc to see what he thinks he also said that he would do a d c every six months whether i need it or not but i think he was kidding later in the week call my onc to see what to do next i will run out of tamoxifen in mid november but i see my onc til mid december are they always this stupid so have to get an rx for one month of tamoxifen or else an rx for an ai it seems like i am the only one who is concerned about any of this and it makes me so mad tif i read that effexor would cause hot flashes but maybe in some women it does the insomnia part is true when i was taking effexor i had trouble sleeping but tamoxifen also caused insomnia i think sleeping better now that i have stopped the effexor but i still have problems sleeping through the night virginia i hope your dad is doing ok i think of you often and hope you are ok sending hugs your way harley lynndeidre good luck

so i hope to get some scans and i have lots of questions for him good to hear from you gitane enjoy the nice weather thinking of you all xoxo hi there i was diagnosed with lobular early this year and had a lumpectomy followed by radiotherapy which finished about one month ago i have chemo because according to my oncologists the benefit be worth it as lobular respond as well to chemo as other breast cancers do my doctors wanted to put me on taxomifen but i refused due to a family history of blood clots and cancer of the cervix uterus they were quite insistent but i stood my ground and was put on femara 1 month ago as i yet gone through menopause which considering i am 53 is unfair they also put me on zoladex injections monthly which halt menopause or stop hormones or something along those lines i allowed to have my ovaries out because they said menopause be far away i too have read that tamoxifen as effective on lbc so am glad i am on femara so far no side effects but i do think i have put a little weight on around my middle and have had an occasional headache i live in auckland new zealand back to the gym this morning but without much enthusiasm have to remind myself all part of fighting oestrogen and not so unpleasant as tamoxifen was i seem to have lost a little weight at last i had a go on the i think the same as an elliptical anyway it really like me my knees were hurting within two minutes the rower is good though and i am visualising rowing around the scottish loch on holidays a few years ago no risk of getting upwinded or caught outin a storm inside the gym kk i get your viewabout owning the equipment but very short of space on the other hand now that i have paid my membership money going to make sure i get out there and use it nats the at trail sounds just delightful going to go look for some pictures a bit worried about all the gardeners and your heavy wheelbarrows so do mind your backs girls had my first tc treatment yesterday only getting 4 rounds so i get a port i had some pain at the iv site and in my arm but they are okay today i was given an iv shot of aloxi for nausea and then a bag of decadron i then had a bag of taxotere and then cytoxan it lasted about 3 hours i had a pretty bad headache all night and had to take a darvocet that i had leftover from mastectomy today my face is hot and flushed but no fever the chemo nurse said it is from the steriods so far no nausea at all taking zofran every 8 hours i had a neulasta shot this morning which is a little sore now i was very hungry and have been eating constantly for 2 days lol but at least not sick to my stomach the chemo nurse said days 3 and 4 are the worst so let everyone know how that goes supposed to see my plastic surgeon tomorrow to have fluid drained from my back lat flap procedure but she said i could wait a week if i want to so i called to push that back now going to eat my happy meal and lay down good luck to everyone and please keep me posted re senekot i kept a journal through my chemo journey i simply labeled blocks from 1 to 21 for days 1 to 21 of my 3 week cycle one column was for how i felt the second column was for what drugs i took after the first cycle i saw where i had problems for example i was painfully constipated the first 4 days so cycles i was on tch not ac i took one senekot nightly for the first 5 days starting the day before chemo after that it converted to major diarrhea my onc said to take 2 immodium if that happened take one more for each subsequent episode that worked for me thanks to the simple journal i knew what side effects were likely to hit and when for later cycles and my onc was delighted to see it it helped me not forget things good luck with your treatment my last chemo was dec 27 2006 and still getting over the side effects no worry the main side effects of my 6 cycles of taxotere were taste changes only started being able to drink coffee again about 2 weeks ago and i still regained my taste for chocolate from the time i started chemo and for the first time in my life m ms are safe in my house laugh but the taste changes were bad enough that my journal was my lifeline i knew that the bad taste in my mouth was normally days so i looked forward to day 11 like you believe yes what happens on each cycle does change a bit but this gives you some good guidelines janet aw you guys brightened my day and only 00am thanks for the messages of positivity patricia and day i made a speech a month ago where i actually admitted that kinda glad i got cancer it really forced me to wake up and realize what was important in life i was so busy working that i was missing out on my family and my friends to be honest it until i slowed down that i even felt the lump pretty hard to miss since it was roughly the size of a softball i say was because it has shrunk not sure of the diameters anymore as i had it measured by the onc but my bra even fits different so smiling something positive to say for this stinking chemo daiva picturing lola in my head and she is awesome have fun with her and your dh in sandiego sacphotomom i also had that dang shoulda got more life insurance conversation in fact i had applied just weeks before i found out matter though they turned me down because of disease anyway i guess just have to be around for a long time summer good luck with your treatment today leanna also nervous switching from ac to taxotere i had bad nausea with ac but i know that most people they have some great drugs like emend work for me which they called the cadillacof other ones gave me migraines for a week so really looking forward to being done with it a bit fearful of the pain with taxotere but lucky in that my counts have yet to tank so i had to have the shot that keeps getting mentioned to get your white count up the pharmacists said that the shot has a definite effect on bone pain as the white blood cells are created in your bone marrow and the shot speeds up the production yuck stay strong ladies just remember we are hero just by being here and fighting i am doing the abraxane because my onc thinks i have to in order to get the avastin paid for he is looking into getting just avastin approved it has been an easy chemo for me compared to taxotere which is basically the same drug sort of hard to sort out which are from which drugs but from talking with colon cancer people who get avastin figured out which are from abraxane i am in round four 3 weeks on one off and have had spectular results resolution of all lung mets and now ned they still give me decadron sort of that way but at least no benadryl which i hate in an iv the decadron bother me that much so i fight it worst nails lifting i started using the tea tree oil which seems to help slow it down and i take care to not get dirt under them and clean it out right away if i and neuropathy in hands and to a lesser extent feet using 20 grams a lot of glutamine in the morning mixed with v 8 or orange juice and it really helps if i skip it for a couple of days i can really tell also eyelashes went my head hair is growing back even on abraxane it came out totally with fec i hope you find this helpful best wishes for good results from your treatment keep at it until you find something that works i also believe that you were given a choice i discussed my chemo options with my mo but he made the decisions i told him i feared ac because of the heart issues and he told me i needed 6tx of tc because of the positive node i did lose my hair but it is back and when i asked him about cold caps he poo it due to the risk of scalp mets and i iced my finger and toe nails for every chemo and had no problems at all in addition i never had nausea and joint pain was minimal and probably more due to the neulasta shot which is given the day after chemo to wbc i had been wivering between taxotere and taxol but taxol can cause permanant neuropathy so i went with taxotere which is what he wanted in the first place hello adagio i was glad to know that your third infusion of taxol paclitaxel went smoothly i was glad to know they were vigilant this time because of your reaction to the second infusion i was not surprised to know that you were there for seven hours in total chemotherapy is time consuming and i remember being in the chemotherapy ward for hours we are dealing with dangerous drugs here so they cannot take any chances you will soon be out of this have you any idea why neulasta causes bone pain this drug was not around as far as i know when i had treatment in the uk but i had no problem with low white blood cell counts it is good that it is available if it makes the chemotherapy journey smoother but i am wondering why it causes bone pain i am not sure about the time sequence for neuropathy i first felt that the soles of my feet felt strange as i was nearing the end of radiotherapy but my oncologist told me it was definitely due to the taxotere docetaxel for years since my treatment it has not bothered me but it seems to bother me more now do you put an ice pack on your feet and hands during treatment and for how long how do you feel the b vitamins and help with the prevention of neuropathy i was so glad to know that you find all the different stories encouraging at least those on the thread know what it is like going through breast cancer treatment in a way that patients cannot know keep looking forward love sylvia xxxx i miss everyone just wondering how everyone is doing i have finished my chem waiting for surgery jan 5th feeling a little depressed today the side effects of the taxotere are hanging on my arms and legs feel like lead weights today i just want tofeel good again jackie hi everyone i am now 5 days out from my first treatment of a c maybe avastin day 1 was uneventful i felt really good day 2 i spent sleeping the entire day and feeling a bit of nausea but not unbearable day 3 just felt a bit blah all day but nothing major nagging headache since treatment since my treatment did not end until after 6 pm on thursday i could not get the neulasta shot until yesterday so far i am not feeling too bad from that when did most of you begin feeling the flu like symptoms from the shot i feel a tiny bit of it today but nothing major sweetpam i am also experiencing burning in my arm just below where my port was inserted not sure what that means not all the time just once in a while i get the burning i am going to go to work beginning tomorrow until my next treatment on the 22nd hoping that goes well i have not be on the past few days but tried to read most of the new entries welcome to our new members sorry you have to be here but glad you found us i will have 12 tx of taxol after this series is over that will be every week i am wondering how that will affect me hey banana love the user name 0 i just wanted to stop by to offer my support and encouragement i started out with multiple bone mets pretty much everywhere in my body i was placed on antihormonal drugs for about 1 yrs until it spread into my bone marrow andliver and the tumors continued to grow i did really really well on the antihormonal drugs with little to no ses other than the typical menopausal symptoms hot flashes achy etc i was started on tamoxifen and when my tumors became resistant i was switched to femara and then to aromasin if not for those pesky liver tumors which may have been there from the beginning i would likely still be on aromasin anyway on chemo now and still doing well my first scan is in august and feeling really good i can even envision ned stopping by woops ned is our acronym for no evidence of disease anyway come to a great sight where you will get a lot support knowledge encouragement and love i encourage your mom to join as i think she will also enjoy it best wishes to you and your mom cat warning vent post lost of self pity and whining when oh when will i start feeling better only been since last thursday that i had my last dd taxol but i still feel lousy i hate taxol and the side effects i had it much easier with adriamyacin sp the bone muscle cramps the fatigue the intestinal issues seems like going on forever help that winter a particularly cold one and just looking at the ice and snow make me tired going back to work part time monday and i dread it but i know i need to start getting back to my old life i was told weeks till i start feeling better and i should excersize and walk to recover better but i feel like moving at all i just want to sit around and feel bad and sorry for myself thanks for listening gg wow how on earth will you be away for 6 weeks that stinks my surgeons are all in dallas 3 hours away but luckily i have a cancer center 5 minutes from my house where i am doing chemo will have rads so a week after my first taxol and feeling pretty good saturday night through tuesday i was so exhausted like extreme fatigue never felt before and i had awful head to toe muscle and bone aches that my pain meds hardly touched that seems to be gone now though and maybe have a week of normal before my next one martha my hemoglobin is the same as yours i started out at and now after 5 rounds of chemo hovering right around where yours is my mo said if it gets below have to think transfusion booo i see him or have labs until next thurs which is supposed to be taxol 2 so see hi everyone i posted awhile back and finally finished reading the whole thread i feel like i know you all thank you for sharing your stories and for being here mine i am 34 was dx 2 days after this last christmas with tnbc was initially thought to be stage ii but since i found the lump in nov 2011 while breastfeeding my 1 month old son i just knew it was going to turn out to be bad i was right after ct scan and port placement on new years eve a few days later i was told it had spread to liver lungs and lymph nodes and i was stage iv i had been seeking consultation on the lump for nearly 1 year at that point and they had missed the cancer the entire time my cancer is very aggressive grade 3 and obviously with tnbc i have to tell you anymore about prognosis i am brca 1 my son is now 20 months old i had 4 rounds of a c which i did not handle well was very sick and when my mo wanted to do 2 more rounds i sought a second opinion at dana farber in boston i had initially met with the mo there at dx but had already started tx at the other hospital she disagreed with continuing ac as scans revealed no real change stable but no shrinkage and with the risk of heart damage she recommended going to 12 weekly taxol instead then we found a clinicial trial that i would qualify for began testing for that and started in april the study is for a parp inhibitor called velaparib and i take it for 7 days along with carboplatin taxol at each cycle which is every 3 weeks i handle this much better although the neuropathy pain from taxol and fatigue i do struggle with i have my first scan on friday the mo does not expect to see any shrinking based on the fact that my breast tumor is unchanged in size i am so afraid to see this as i fear that nothing will work for me i know i have only begun with tx options and thanks to this thread i can see that many of you have found ones that have worked to buy some years which gives me hope i want to die before my son can have memories of me that is truly the most devastating part of this for me i want him to know and feel my love before i go i started a blog recently mostly as but also for friends and family to try to understand what going through the website is stellablue dot net if anyone would like to follow me i hope to get to know you ladies more and i wish everyone the best hoping for miracles for all of us cheri mentors a great company our rep does alot for our patients great implants as well but so is naturelle i kinda think you should get the verdict on the adriomycin before proceeding with the swap the only reason i say this is because i had adriamycin with cytoxin after my surgery and i ended up with an infection that was impossible to deal with during treatment i ended up in the hospital and on iv antibiotics and then on antibiotics for weeks by mouth and had to have the d drain put back in then yet another infection when they popped my expander and more antibiotics not fun then again i had a mastectomy and not just an exchange nonetheless still an invasive procedure how are feeling after the herceptin so with my hair falling out from the taxol this is my first time losing my hair in this big adventure i walked down to walgreens yesterday to buy clippers i live in the middle of san francisco very urban it was a lovely day out and people were all out on the streets barbequing hanging out i passed a very traditional african american run barber shop they were celebrating a birthday of some sort kids running around food music all spilling out onto the sidewalk on a whim i asked for the barber on duty and told him that i needed my head shaved because i was losing it due to chemo to my surprise he gave me a big hug and said oh honey cmon in take care of you so i got the full barber shop treatment hot steamy towels tonics lotions i even got my first shave he laughed at the peach fuzz it was a complete trip we talked obama louisianna oil spill baseball and the weather talk about the deluxe treatment at the end he tied my scarf around my newly bald head told me to come back any time and that pray for me it was a lovely way to get through this necessary chore i highly recommend a real barber for anyone needing their head shaved and if you catch him on a sunny day with a party going on so much the better it was also cheaper than the clippers even with a good tip cheers donna hi i was diagnosed with dcis in may 2010 and ended up with a single mastectomy the final pathology indicated some invasion the cells were hormone negative and herceptin positive my chemo regimen is 4 treatments of adriamycin cytoxan every 3 weeks then 12 weekly doses of herceptin and taxol then herceptin every 3 weeks for 9 months i was initially concerned about the cardiotoxicity of adriamycin but my onc said that less than 3 have cardio se plus i do not have any of the high risk factors younger than 60 have not had chemo before my heart is good and the dose of adriamycin is not high he believes that ac followed by th has slightly better results that tch i also got a port as the a is very hard on the veins for y first treatment i took emend and also received aloxi and dexamethasone my se were mild i go for my second dose on and i hope the se will be as mild margaret tooky i worked i have a very physical job and full of needles sharp objects on my feet and wrangling big dogs vet tech i had infusions on mon and found working tue wed and thurs morning was doable because of the steriods but by thursday night i crashed friday and saturday were the worst especially with taxol the second week i would work toward the end of the week which was my best time you will find what works for you after the first few infusions jazzy sorry i scared you i think i am in the minority that taxol was worse me and annie plus i had taxol every other week which seemed harder than the weekly taxol gals i had asked my mo for weekly but he said dd was the standard he used the taxol would hit me by thurs when i would start running a high fever chills and bone pain like a bad flu it was the only time i vomited so started taking nausea all the time after that it started where i would be better by the following week non taxol wk but by the last taxol infusion i have any good days between infusions and my feet hurt like h ll i had to take pain pills to stand on my feet so long which comes with my job i still have neuropathy even though it has been months since my last taxol hopefully you will be in the majority that had an easier time with taxol good morning all viddie glad the taxol is going ok are you having joint pains mine hit on sunday and monday mostly treatments are on wed not horrible but enough in my fragile state to feel like more than i would like to deal with i am also worried about weight i lost 60 lbs about six years ago ww work there and i have been diligent about keeping it off i have gained back the few lbs i lost on ac and am hoping to stop it there i feel bloated around my middle i am trying to watch what i eat feel like i am being careful but am not getting enough exercise my getaway is just to the local mountains in southern cal we have never gone my husband has always said he wants to go the sierras if we are going to the mountains well these are only three hours away everyone i know loves this spot and i am staying in a hotel that two good friends recommend as the nicest one there and my husband as you all know coming b c he break his training for his marathon at the end of july i am over the anger am still very hurt at his priorities but am actually looking forward to four days of reading walking looking for bald eagles sitting at the lake and room service it feels like the right transition back to my old life if my old life is still there i have lots of fun things to look forward to over the summer culminating in our younger wedding in october so i just need to get through the next 8 taxols happy friday all mary watch that drain melia hi snowyday your name is very appropriate for today forecasting 20 cm of snow for today i was diagnosed in sept 07 after my annual mammo i had a lumpectomy in oct and started chemo in november had 3 treatments every three weeks for fecand go for my second of three sessions 3 weeks apart of d feb 6th we used to live in cambridge so when we moved i kept my fd there because such a shortage of doctors in this area sooo my chemo has been at the cambridge hospital 45 min away if i have radiation it will be at grand river hospital i say if because i met my radiologist this past monday to go over treatment cursed with nicodine addiction and he said i need to stop smoking for radiation that threw me into a panic because tried everything out there except acupuncture to quit smoking and been successful i feel barely keeping my head above water with the chemo have neuropathy from the taxatere plus fatique and to add nocodine withdrawal at this time just seem possible did some research and a new report 08 on the journal of clinical oncology saying women who smoked but have radiation were nearly 6 times as likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer than while women who smoked and did undergo radiation were nearly 19 times more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer after having smoked for forty odd years i know a walking time bomb for lung cancer but why increase the risk when the risk for mets with triple negative is already there going to ask the radioligistif no radiation and mastectomy might be an option at this time anyone else in this damned if i do damned if i situation barb 47 hi all interested to read about diet can anyone get a nutritional therapist from the haven shall look into this am currently launching myself into milk free diet tho just had some m and s chocs bought for me and loads of veg veggie anyway and nuts and seeds etc reading lots about appropriate diet and yes cut out coffee alcohol and only honey trying not to eat refined sugar feel loads better but as only doing this for less than a week will see only weeks post surgery so not quite ready to implement exercise programme but will do this am on arimidex feel hangoverish some of the time then full of energy and feet and ankles ache sore sweats thick and fast 4 in the night start with waking up with nausea chill pillow helps just put on some sea sick bands work on acupressure points becoming more articulate but memory not so good could be post surgery or possibly the arimidex taking supplements trying omega 3 tomorrow hoping the joint aches will lessen cos feel a lot older than 47 bye for now hey triple congrats on all who are done with chemo i had my second taxotere treatment today it does not give me nausea just some bone pain which i think is from the neulasta shot and then from the drugs so the two combined to make me hurt got a strange rash on the forearm but it cleared up really quick jayne you said your tongue was coated is it white it might be thrush which i got with the first treatment they give you magic mouthwash for that my tongue was white all over it and some on the sides of my mouth so go look then call the doc i was am taking claritin for the bone pain from the shot but they said it might help with the taxotere also read another thread on this drug worth a try as i need for my allergries any way good luck to all and hugs and strength dianne christine just wanted to say my last taxol was on thurs and like julieh mentally i was rejoicing but physically it was extremely difficult especially with the bone pain i think i was so excited to be done that i thought i could do more than i really could ended up it supposedly i get my radiation sim on friday the 6th and then port removal on fri the 20th and hopefully radscan start on 25th ish or so still waiting for hair good luck most likely they will go over your family medical history and decide what if any tests are warranted about the iud for what worth i was having horrible frequent periods with tons of breast pain and bloating prior to my diagnosis but tamoxifen has actually made all of that much better with very few annoying side effects minor hair loss occasional hot flushes and occasional leg cramps but none frequent or severe enough to be a real problem the reduction in pms lighter less frequent periods more than make up for the negative aspects at least for me you will of course need to decide on another form of birth control hi ninel back in sept of 2005 the chemo for early node negative bc was dose dense ac 4 rounds taxol was not yet routinely given although shortly it would be so i just received the ac it was rough for me and i would probably not have done the taxol even if it was offered most women do fine on chemo make sure to get a prescription for emend so that nausea will be a make sure to take your temperature several times a day and be diligent about reporting any persistant fevers that is where i screwed up i was not being my own advocate and let fevers get out of control i feel you have a strong support system and will be cared for and guided throughout your chemo regimen it is scarey but you can do it and the time goes by quite quickly once you get started i am kind of happy you are being offeredlots of chemo it really is supposed to work wondersfor us triple negatives oh i agree with stacy removal of some muscle was not in any way painful and surprisingly had no effect on my mobility by the way after your senital node surgery you will probably experience some numbness it feels weird but that is no big deal i looked at some of your bio you are so young it breaks my heart but remember stage 1offers so much hope and i justfeel going to work out for you good luck on your surgery on the 18th and happy birthday p hello 39 on tamoxifen recently had an oophorectomy and my hair is thinning badly does anyone have any tips for this problem i understand there are some medications that can be used for this has anyone out there tried these and if so did it work and what were the side effects i know it is a relatively trivial problem but it is bothering me and not keen to get the wig out again any help would be really appreciated log in to post a reply hi my sunshineei use gel packs take them out of the freezer at home pile them in my small cooler they are flexible even when frozen so i smoosh them in the cooler i wait until they start the taxol get out the beach towels bury my hands and nails in one gel pack rest my feet on another and place another on top of the toenails i have two med sized ones and two large ones they stay cold for the hour the taxol infuses i like how flexible they are and i can move the gel around to avoid them getting too thawed out i have to pull out my hands and feet when they get numb but then put them back in the overall effect is construction of those vessels and little capillaries while the high dose neuropathic agent is going in i really believe it works i am banking on the icing and the supplements preventing the neuropathy good to think we have some control over something here even if we do get weird looks at the chemo center midlife i was initially on mylan then mylan discontinued production so i was switched to watson the bone and joint pain started within the first week and got progressively worse i was on it for about months before i called my office in tears i found soltamox a liquid form after hours of online researching and asked my mo if i could try that she had never heard of it it was that new to the market it entered the u s market in october 2012 it is marketed to people having difficulty swallowing pills probably why it was hard to find three months ago i was told it was no longer available thus the switch back to mylan soltamox is imported from the uk my cvs has a three month supply in stock though and contacted my onc for a new script she said mine once the script comes in soltamox may be back in production check them out my ses from watson stopped almost immediately after i quit my main ses from both the mylan and soltamox has been brain fog short term memory loss pelvic cramps and pain and muscle cramps i take magnesium for the muscle cramping which has helped tremendously although i think i need to up my dosage as starting to get them at night again sorry if this was tmi i know you request it amyedited to add i could not pinpoint the bone and joint pain to a specific ingredient but the fillers are different in all three meds watson mylan and soltamox on tamoxifen since just before christmas i have hot flashes but i had those since chemo i have trouble sleeping common se and i seem to be gaining weight this all sucks but at the same time i find it comforting that i have this little pill to take to keep the cancer away the after treatment phase is a strange place to be mentally sometimes carrol 2 long time no hear many ladies do get chemopause then tamox can also disrupt your menstrual cycle or stop it for long enough to make you highly irregular tamox being the fun drug that it is can be as capricious as stopping your period for months but if for some reason you would like your period back just go on a trip for a week or long weekend and say i warn you you might be with lowered natural estrogen at your age and your doc can test your levels if your curiosity really wants to know if you have not gone a whole year without a menstrual cycle most docs will not consider you to be in full menopause therefore arimidex is not an option at this time that may or may not be an option a few years down the road been on aromasin for 3 months and have a pill for all the side effects ativan for insomnia gabapentin for night sweats prevacid for heart burn this se was the worst for me and scared the heck out of me as my worst mets are in the stomach thanks lobular 2 mg diluadid seems to help w fatigue go figure but try to use those very sparingly off the ativan now as the insomnia seems to have resolved fortunately no joint pain fun and games trying to lead a life me me me last tx thursday wait feel like a child waiting for on the tastebuds thing yuk almost a whole week after taxotere i have the vivid feeling of eating paper everything tastes nothing hate it on the hair after my 2nd taxotere my hair seems to be growing back i think hoping too much see thanks new olga and gardengumby definitely make certain to at least get a bone density scan just prior to starting femara and ask for one on an an annual basis thereafter i have been taking the drug for 22 months and the amount of bone loss i have sustained is extremely alarming unfortunately cannot be going back on femara femara is known tocause bone loss in users just how muchbone loss is the variance for each individual all will have loss some have a lower and tolerable amount others like me cannot take the drug the website states this right from the onset look for yourself i did not really understand the numbers behind theresults of the original study l2 2 l3 6 sid 130 cid 1393 pid 0 catid 02383women were put into the trial 1579 took femara 804 did not 2 31 of the 1579 women taking letrozole had a recurrence compared with 39 of the 804 women who chose to not take the drug this is the 60 percent reduction noted in the media stories a reduction of to 2 is a reduction of 60 these numbers do tend to show a trend but they show the whole picture for example looking at who was studied and how they came to be in the study is important the women who were randomly assigned initially got to choose whether they wanted to start taking femara or take the placebo this means that these results come from a randomized trial a higher percentage ofwomen who chose to not start taking femara also have chemotherapy which could have been a factor in their local and distant recurrence rates while the researchers did try to account for these differences in their statistical analysis it could have influenced the findings knowing this i know about you but out of2383 women 31 of the femara takers got a recurrence vs 39 recurrence in thosethat did not take femara the difference between the 31 in test group 1 and 39 in test group twois 60 but that does not mean 60 of2383 it is easy to be persuaded by others when they toss around a number such as well if you take femara you have a 60 less chance of recurrence these numbers seem a bit deceiving i did not investigatethis study like i should have because i bought into my doctors and peers enthusiasm you will likely not end up with the exteme bone loss that i have suffered but the increase in your odds of getting osteoporosis are just about as high as the of cabenefit you will receive they are about equal a gamble you are understandably willing to take cancer or osteoporosis anyone would likelytake the risk of osteoporosis over cancer and i got it now i have to worry about a whole host of new problems and ca recurrence bummer for me my grudge is that my onc should have have a bone density scan done at one year post starting femara see femara website for their recommendation having understood the femara test results and being aware of thechance of getting osteoporisis would havealerted me to pushing my onc for a bone density test one year after starting just to make sure my body was handling the femara okay if the loss was appreciable at one year my onc and iwould have talked aboutchoosing to stay on femara and hoping it did not worsen or perhaps look at altenatives such as putting me on tamoxifen while maybe not as effective as femara tamox is still beneficial to post menopausal women without such high of a risk for bone loss you both are new to femara so you have a chance to monitor itseffect on your bones go two years like i did and get 2 rib fractures just 22 months after taking femara no woman in my family has osteoporosis by the way the change of down to after 22 months on femara is a phenomenal amount words my doc used you willlikely not realize bone loss after only a handful of months on femara my suggestion is the ensure youget an annual bone density scan to ensure your skeleton is safe i am very athletic 5 4 110 lbs always have been fit and healthy andeat well i am upping the exercise now i have to stop the femara i have no choice maybe tamoxifen but i know see what the docs want to do hopefully there is no other underlying cause that is still an option but general consensus is that this is a direct cause of femara by the way i also took 6 zometa iv treatments in a trial that finished in 2010 apparently the zometa did not do much for me i wonder if the femara zometa trial is attempting to acertain if the zometa can aid in the bone loss femara users experience also i am a very small statured small boned white woman white caucasian women who are small boned are particularly suseptible to bone loss on femara something else i did not know hindsight if you are not white and or have larger bones you will very likely not have my trouble the good news is that at 48 assuming there is no other underlying cause i have a chance of restoring some of this loss bones are similar to skin in that they can regenerate unfortunately i be able to use eli new forteo drug as i had radiation therapy but there are other options for for those of us affected swimming is a good one best ofluck baf 4292 yes i had taxotere tac i appriciate everyones comments the hairloss has been by far one of the hardest parts of this bc journey for me i am going to try and relax and stay away from the mirror for a few more weeks i check into the hair thread several times a day to see hope of growth taking it at the standard dosage 20mg day caused me severe ses most leg cramps headaches increased joint pain terrible mood swings i could live with but two continued to get worse over time and eventually caused me to stop the most distressing one was eye problems i developed pain in the backs of my eyes and increasing blurry vision the day i was driving my daughter somewhere and was having so much trouble seeing that i was tempted to pull over is the day i quit my vision cleared up by about three weeks after quitting my eye doc said it was tamoxifen toxicity i also developed pain and pressure in my pelvis the pressure stopped within a week or so of quitting but the pain continued the tamoxifen had caused two ovarian cysts my gyn will be checking in a few weeks to see if they have cleared up done a bunch of research and these types of eye problems are rare ovarian cysts in premenopausal women are very common but a lot of women have any associated pain not sure why i do is the supplement for neuropathy i just did round 2 of taxol today yesterday i met with my oncologist and she prescribed gabapentin for mt neuropathy make sure to wean off slowly if you take it i ice my hands and feet during infusion we bring a cooler full of ice packs so far i have a white marks on my nails but no looseness yet my eyebrows are falling out rapidly today i looked in the mirror just now and had straight hairs all over my face and huge gaps in my brows thank goodness for eyebrow pencil my mother went through this sat year and put ice packs on her eyes her brows and lashes still fell out on her last treatment i decided not to ice my eyes and i am ok with that this is always an interesting discussion to me i was at dx and could not take i had to go on lupron shots monthly and letrozole did this for 3 went off lupron at my request so we could see if i was in period since june when i went off and none since chemo in 2009 so i think it is a safe bet the early days of both of these drugs were hard for not tell which one caused which problem having now been off the lupron for a few months i can tell it caused my fuzzy head and some of the joint issues i had been toying with going off letrozole i still have about years on it but so far bones are fine the main issue for me is vaginal dryness and lack of libido and i am trying so hard to work with those two things but i am glad it is only those two i think i will have my estrogen checked in december at my next appt i did not know the ovaries could act up again sigh my onc is a true believe in hormonal therapy above all i have great respect for her and i think she is right but the qol is important and if mine had been significantly worse i think i would have gone off since i had chemo and radiation this is the great mystery we just never really know lisa yeast infections somethign that not heard for tamox use i really think you should follow up with gyn about that just in case based on something else jsut about all other psots are things had or heard of on tamox unfortunately i forgot about so many of them until i read these posts which is good cause i have them anymore and the brain has a way of wiping out bad memories yes i choose that option over the one that says my memory cells are fried from tamoxifen and or chemo and so hard to know what is tamox and what is regular menopause both suck important in case it mentioned many times before crucial to see gyn every 6 mos while on tamox to monitor uterine and cervical changes carefully hugs all around i had a longer than normal course of chemo in 2012 ac dd taxol dd carboplatin 6 months taxol caused my neuropathy carboplatin exacerbated i never had it as bad as most as i could hike on dirt trails and roads though my feet burned and tingled toward the end of every hour hike and i suffered the rest of the day with burning and i had constant numbness initially i had some drop foot and weird stuff with my bladder and lower back which i now think neuropathy walking on flat ground or down hill much harder than uphill force walking thru the costco parking lot or standing on cement floors the worst i was told i would only see improvement for one year maybe two years about right until this last july when i took 2 weeks off from walking and i experienced some miraculous improvement i still have numb toes and the balls of my feet a bit numb still burning and some tingling but i would say i took a jump from 50 of the worst to about 20 in a rather sudden way after that break and this is year 3 after chemo other than the break i can say since the first of the year i have been using b12 oral spray daily could that have made the difference yesterday i even walked hours on paved flat streets with very little after affect yes i still am aware i have neuropathy in my feet if i think about it but my feet are not constantly reminding me of it like they did even earlier this year so i think there is hope for improvement even 3 years out rubyred a discussion about your question copy and paste the above into your browser i too gained weight during about three months after i was done i lost all the water weight within about two weeks and was back to my there is hope i remember those feelings you are feeling though and you have a right to be angry however you feel you have a right to it you have been through a horrible traumatic event i finished rads october 13th this year and have been on tamoxifen since no big deal for me as chemo put me in menopause and the tamox is just keeping me there my experience may be different from yours as i just turned 50 i am so sorry you are having to go through this sue scott and cristy this is such an amazing thread hearing the news about your kids as you navigate this treatment for me i had no allergic reactions to the taxol and felt energetic for days because of the steroids although had difficulty sleeping by the 3rd day i got achy all over and quite a bad headache then i got a rash on my head that cleared up with vit e oil and benadryl ointment so it was probably related to allergy again everyone is so different in their side effects i think it was the weekly steroids that i had more trouble with made me an emotional roller coaster donna jules i loved your response to those women you know just a few months before my sister maryanne passed i went to visit her in kentucky she seen me since my surgery and was really curious and she being hyped up on her pain meds really wanted to see my new foobs well i made my bil leave the room natch pulled up my i wearing a bra like most days now and she was like oh yeah well mine too and she jerked her shirt up and was flashing the whole room i thought it was hilarious i will always carry that special memory as warped as it is with me for the rest of my life i have learned to take a lot of comments with a grain of salt because i know i was just as dumb pre cancer dx i remember a few unkind things said not because i was mean but just because i was ignorant and if i could i would apologise to that person but she has moved and i have no idea where as for the tamoxifen unfortunately it was not good for me at first it was doing what it was supposed to do but because i had ovarian cysts it made them grow and i also wound up with fibroid tumors in my uterus and around my ovaries which thankfully were all benign but i still had a totla hyst and ooph i went on femara and the bone pain was intolerable so i went on arimidex and it has been somewhat better not exactly se free but at least tolerable i still have stiff fingers and joint pain but it is nothing compared to what it used to be i wish you all a great day and hope all your diminish greatly edited to add juli i thought i was the only one with the stinging skin when i got too hot i do chemo or rads either i especially have stinging on top of my head when i am too hot and i break out in a bad sweat good morning amazing women thought of all of you so much even though i have not been posting about weeks pfc and am still struggling with my energy level had hoped i could report more positively i think it is sleep issues more than anything else hot flashes possibly drug reactions and a little anxiety thrown in do not make for a good sleep i started taking tamoxifen a few weeks ago and have not noticed any particular side effects from that i already had hot flashes and have not seen much change there i started taking effexor to try to help the flashes but know yet if that will work i think it takes a while i think initiallly i tried to do too much too soon after chemo so have backed off and am still being very protective of my time and energy i have my exchange surgery scheduled for the 28th so am looking forward to getting that done after that i should really feel like i am able to recover without any other setbacks on the schedule i really hope you get some answers to your questions about the mris i know it must be incredibly frustrating to contemplate a change in treatment plan at this point i hope they are able to continue as planned missswim hope you are feeling and kk11 hope the neuropathy and nail pain gets better soon only had a bit of the nail soreness and that is mostly gone although my nails are discolored oh as far as hair goes noticed some longer grey hairs that have probably been growing all along apparently chemo did not kill my greys and now there is peach fuzz starting not what i expected it will be interesting to see how this regrowth happens wishing all of you the best this week so glad i found this thread i finished a c end of aug and started weekly taxol mid sep i have numbness in feet and pain joint aches muscle aches the type head twinges islandmama mentioned and lots of bowel issues i have the bloody nose mucus in the morning my onc is keeping an eye on the neuropathy it is very mild in my hands my hair fell out with a c and the taxol is keeping it out i have my eyebrows and eyelashes but no hair north and south i also feel lightly dizzy most of the time and have noticed my eyes seeing as well but thought it was my prescription so glad again i found this thread will be taking taxol into dec and finishing into next sep with the herceptin yes they told me it was the mild chemo also i am very glad i have my port because my arm veins are worthless for on a side note any tricks for keeping a cap on at night my head has started to get cold with the weather and it falls off k
